My Kids [13M-11M] are not over the moon with SO [38F] moving with me.[40M] How should approach them?,"I got divorce 8 years and at the begging I was living a 45 minutes drive from my kids. It took a year to found something nice at 10 minutes by walk and it was expensive. The house needed renovations and I involved my kids in nearly every process, it was a great way to bond again and to let them feel always welcome and safe in my house.

Over the years they welcomed a half-sister \[3F\] and a stepfather. Their house is big enough for all them and after some tantrums, they adjusted in a comfortable routine. They love their sister but they still have enough space for them to be alone or play together.

Since I started to date my SO, my kids who are/acting like teenagers were adamant to spend less time with her and more time with me. I believed that for some reasons, they were afraid to not have me ""*around*"" anymore and I started to realize that in the last few years, they used my place to relax, play and ""run"" from their mother when they have a disagreement. Despite the fact that we had an awful divorce, we co-parent very well, so I usually let them be for a bit and then back up what their mother had said, they have the same rules between the household. But my house has that kind of ""bro"" vibe that maybe now is very important for them.

My SO is in the process to move with me (few things to pack still and other logistics), and this weekend was officially the first one as a couple who live under the same roof with my kids. It didn't end well. They were critical of any small changes and saying that they will come every afternoon when she is at work. When they discover that we decided to switch the TV between the bedroom and the living room, they blamed my SO in a very rude way.

SO was quite upset, she is always tried to be considerate and pay great attention to their passions and hobbies. This is new for both of us and for them too. I realize that they always had me for themselves and the fact that I do like their stepfather and often all four of us we do something together could be part of the problem since they had all of our attention. I punished the kids by taking all the electronics and forcing them to do extra-homework, I got pizza and tried to talk about the way they were acting only to have as answer: We do not like women.

I told them they like their sister and their mother, so why exclude SO now and not before we were living together? They replied that mother and sister do not count. SO was going to change the house in pink and women in general are just bad.

I do realize that boys at that age can go in a weird no-girls phase, but why with SO, after they know each other for one year?

SO decided to spent Sunday out until quite late, this morning she packed their lunch with some nice cookies with Halloween themed and they replied that they are not ""babies"" and they do not like cookies (A blatant lie, it's the only thing they would eat forever). I snapped a bit and drove them to school. I called my ex-wife and she was very cold and replied that I am moving to fast with this woman (Know her for 4 years, dating for one) while she met her partner, got pregnant and married within a year.

Did someone has some issues with kids and new partners? Did you had this type of reaction, when one of you parents moved on? Do you have any advice?

SO has health problems and starting some new treatment soon. We are thinking to get married next year and to tried for a kid (first for her) if her health is going to be better. I don't want my kids to feel left out/have resentments. I think I am a good father, but maybe a little to ""comfortable"" with the good cop role, should I approach things differently?

tl;dr: Kids are behaving rudely against my SO and the fact that she lives with me for no apparent reason.",parenting

What's your opinion on technology and its influence on children's reading habits?

My babydad tries to replace jewelry my kid wears when she visits him and I'm not sure if I should do anything.,"I(24F) have full custody of my 4 yr old daughter and i recently started letting her visit her dad(25M) after 8 months of no contact. Ive previously had restraining orders because he was obsessed with me and he just hasnt been an ideal father. We have been split since she was 6months after him cheating and me leaving bla bla...

Her auntie dropped her off this morning and i noticed the gold bracelet she always wore was replaced with some fake silver and gold one. I asked her where it was after i checked the bag i sent her over with.  She loves her dad to death so i don't think she would lie about him.  She told me he wouldn't let her wear it and made her take it off. I texted the auntie about the bracelet and what my daughter said since i don't have contact with her dad. Auntie tells me that my kids dad had no idea where it was.  I qsked my daughter and she said it was on the table in the living room where he put it.  Auntie tells me she finds it on the table. 


Maybe im dramatic but he does have history of telling my daughter bad things about me and he always lies.  Should i confront him???  Not let my daughter see him? Its been 4 years and he hasn't changed. I feel bad because she always begs to see him but comes back extremely emotional. This is the 3rd time he's seen her in 5 months",parenting

Advise please?,"How do I react?

I’m so angry currently. My daughters ex girlfriend is talking nonsense about my daughter on Twitter. They have been broken up nearly 3 years and her ex continues to talk badly of my daughter.

There were problems in their relationship, both were needy, demanding and toxic for one and other.

My daughter had mental health problem and when they split up my daughter spent a long time in therapy talking about past trauma and then reached out to her ex apologising for the time she had been bad to her.

Please be aware that my daughters ex also had issues, she never wanted to be away from my daughter and she never wanted to go home. Many a time I heard the ex having a good at my daughter and them both ending up in tears.

My daughter has made such progress during and since her therapy and now she is back at university studying her masters.

My daughter has asked me not to contact the ex but I’m so angry at her ex’s portrayal of my daughter.

Please no hate, I’m new heard and I’d appreciate honest replies.

Dealing with toddler's anger,"Anyone here deal with anger problems/hatefulness in a toddler? My son, just turned four, has had an attitude for a long time, but as he's aged it had turned more into outright anger.
He gets upset as soon as something doesn't go how he wants and begins to yell, scream, cry, and what bothers me the most is he will tell us (mostly me) to shut up, go away, he doesn't like us, get away from him. It's mostly toward me, but if my wife tells him to stop then he turns on her too.
I can't do anything about it, it seems. If I scold him, he gets more furious, if I spank him, he just breaks down crying, if I try to calm him down and talk to him softly, he will just run off. I don't know what to do. What's worse is that I feel like I'm walking on eggshells the entire time because as soon as I try anything that upsets him more my wife will then scold me in front of him for being mean.
It's definitely driving a wedge between my wife and I. And it feels shitty, but I'm starting to not really like my son because he acts this way so often and easily. I think about just leaving for my own health.
Anyone deal with this before?",parenting
UPDATE: DSS Came to my house,"Update from my previous post about CPS calling at my house earlier this week:
 [Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/dk0173/dss_came_to_my_house_today)

Posting from mobile; let me know if this is illegible. 

So the rest of the week passed, Sunday came and it was time for my ex to bring our daughter back to me for my week. She was a no-show and didn't call or anything, so I called her myself asking where she was with our daughter and if she would be on her way soon. She blatantly said she wouldn't allow our daughter back to stay with me for my appointed parenting time until the DSS investigation (which **she** called in!) is finished, which will not be for another month and a half. 

I called the police and had them come with me to her house with a copy of our custody order, but their hands are tied and can't physically make her give her back to me. They said the best I can hope for right now is to take her to court and she would be held in contempt for violating the order. 

So here I am; haven't really slept in over 24 hours, the government is still investigating me on bogus claims, my daughter is not with her family where she belongs, and I'm tired, angry, and just fed up with the whole system. I'm visiting a list of attorneys this morning once business hours hit and I'm firing back with everything I've got.

Any suggestions for where to go from here? Is there anything I'm missing? Have you been where I am right now?",parenting

"Seeking advice - dealing with tantrums and ""kiddie wishes"" for 3-4 year old","Hi. Today morning my little one did not want to get up from bed. It took some toys and music to convince him leave the bed and get up. Then, he did not want to brush his teeth. He put up various conditions one after another:

* Count to ten; then I will. 
* Get me the red t-shirt; then I will.
* I want to stand on the washbasin; then I will.
* I will make my teddy bath; then I will.
* I will make my teddy bath in the washbasin; then I will.
* I will use your toothbrush for my teeth.
* Sit down and I will make you brush first.
* I want you to jump like you did on Sunday to make me brush.
* I will brush when mommy holds and makes me brush (mommy is on a business trip for a week).
* I want to wear my gum-boots first.

and a few more kiddie wishes; which are at times entertaining but then, there are lot of other things to do. Both me and my wife work. I have to be at office usually by 9.30. She is currently travelling for work and will be back towards end of the week. 

Today, I took me 4 hours to negotiate and get him ready for the day-care. It gets to nerves sometimes when there are other things to do on schedule but the little one does not understand about that and has his own wishlist to fulfill before he can do something else. It does get irritating sometimes and sometimes, I feel like I am losing patience. I don't want to be angry on him but I am not sure if I give up sometime? How do you people deal with such circumstances? The catch-22 situation is that I can leave him to his tantrums. But that is making me late for work. So, I try to negotiate. But that is bringing lot of unwanted wishes (or then, makes him believe that I can ask anything when Mamma and Papa are busy).

We tried lot of things, like ""stars"" for every thing that he does in time (and redeem stars for something he likes) or then appreciating when he does something good in various ways. He has taken it for his advantage. He will ""throw"" a toy, pick it up and come to me telling - Papa, I cleaned the toy. No I want a star. 

Any advice would help. Thanks in advance.",parenting

I failed as a mother and wife and now I'm paying for it. I'm basically nothing more than the maid.,"I know it sounds ridiculous but I swear housework and cooking will be the death of me. There are seven people in my house. Me, my husband, and five kids ages 20, 18, 15, 12, and 10. Out of all seven people, there is one who does ANYTHING around the house. You guessed it - me. And I'm drowning. I've been drowning for years. It's impossible. It's absurd. There's no winning. 

Do dishes before bed? Both sides of the sink are piled up to the faucet by noon. God forbid I skip even a single day, there will be no clean dishes to eat of off or forks to use. And then my husband will be passive aggressive and bitchy if he has to wash his own. Nobody will wash more then they themselves need in that moment either, so don't think someone will step up if I just leave it.

Do laundry Sunday? It will need to be done again by Wednesday because we don't have many clothes...except the older three, who do their own laundry but wait until every single fucking thing they own is dirty. And this seems to ALWAYS happen when I need to do laundry. The three of them will be fucking racing down the stairs and fighting over who gets to go first with their five hours worth of laundry if they see me going for our hampers. Meanwhile, I really need to do laundry so me, husband, and 12 &amp; 10 have pajamas and clean clothes for the next day.

Cooking? Jesus Christ, forget about it. I give up. There is nothing on this planet all seven of us will eat. I've tried and tried to be a good housewife and cook nutritious, tasty meals. My ungrateful children and cave-dwelling husband won't have it. They are the pickiest eaters I've ever seen. I swear I tried to raise my kids to not be afraid of vegetables or new food but a lot of good it did. The 12, 10 and 15 year olds are still under my grasp and will choke down whatever I cook because of the 'if you don't like it, don't eat' rule and since they don't work, they can't feed themselves - but the older 2 and my husband? Nothing but junk food and fast food. The three of them will make entire meals out of potato chips. They'll straight up have a pack of cookies for sinner. They'll make fun of how my food looks or smells. They drink literally nothing but soda, all of the toilets are filled with ORANGE piss like chamber pots because their lazy asses never flush. The 20y/o has a habit of eating an entire bag of pizza rolls in a day. They buy a lot of food with their own money but besides the fact it is nothing but junk food, my husband will get into their shit so they'll get into ours and eat us out of house and home. So now it's quite the source of drama because the younger kids are mad their dad and the older kids get to eat good stuff while they're stuck with mom's boring trash cooking. My husband will walk in from work, look at what I'm cooking and say ""I'm heading to [insert fast food chain here] want to come 18 &amp; 20?"" So I've taken to cooking whatever I want and the younger 3 will eat, which pisses my husband off because I don't cook for him...but HE WON'T EAT ANYTHING! No vegetables except mashed potatoes. Nothing pan fried. Nothing broiled. Nothing boiled. Some stuff he seems to just turn his nose up at for the hell of it. The list goes on and on. 

Cleaning? Please. I'm the only person who has touched a sponge, vaccum cleaner, or bottle of Lysol in twenty years. If I want a clean toilet to crap in, that's on me. If I want a clean bathtub to soak in, that's on me. If I don't want old food to sit in the fridge and become sentient because it has so much mold, that's on me. Every single thing. Because the rest of them would be happy to live in pure squalor and filth. The 20y/o and 18y/o share a room and it will without a doubt have to be professionally cleaned when they move out. Your feet will stick to the carpet. There's mold and rotting food and an incident a while back with a pile of used condoms under the bed. For a while, they just tossed their used pads/tampons in the corner if they needed to change them while they were getting dressed. 20y/o chainsmokes in the room with the windows closed. It's a fucking disaster.

Everything is just so hectic too. Money is always tight. The kids are always fighting. My husband's always got his panties in a twist over something. I don't work so I don't have money of my own, I don't drive so I can't go anywhere, I don't have friends. The kids are disrespectful as fuck and talk down to me all the time and I've just given up on trying to correct them. The 20y/o will roll her eyes and tall to me like I'm 5, they call me stupid/dumb/bitch/whatever else they can think of if I ask them to help with housework. We don't act like a family at all. We don't go out. We don't have game nights. Everyone is off in their own spaces every night and my husband does nothing but watch TV from dawn to dusk unless he's at work.

It's awful. I kinda can't wait until they're all gone.",parenting
Is it normal for a teen to laugh by herself?,"My 15 year old daughter is several times a day laughing manically in her room, repeating phrases over and over again and making weird facial expressions when she is alone like if she is talking to herself.

To give a little back story, it appears this has happened once before and her mom told her to give the phone back. Her dad and I did not know. Well, apparently the friend ""insisted"" she take it. Interestingly enough, it happens to be something she's always wanted, but we've all felt strongly against. Well tonight, her sneaking failed and I heard her face timing. She tries to lie about how long ahead had the device. I guess she thought we were too stupid to work an iPhone. Finally got the story out of her.  

Long story short, this weekend the lying came to a head previously to tonight, in regards to her school work.  She's opened a tiktok and snapchat account, luckily nothing horrible is on anything. Just really nasty song lyrics.

Getting a 4 year old to clean up?,"We’ve got an ongoing struggle with getting our (just turned) 4 year old to pick up get toys. She’s stubborn, independent and nothing seems to phase her. I’ve been working on this for 2 years now and we haven’t made any progress. We had a total meltdown today over cleaning up and I’ve had it. Please send me your tips! 

Here’s what we’ve tried without success: 

- put away a toy before you can have a new one. She will then sit contentedly with the old one for however long until it’s time for dinner or bed. 

- it’s a game! Who can go faster, who can do the most, all the red ones, etc. this has literally never worked. She couldn’t care less about the game 

- let’s sing a song. Same as a game. She just looks at me while I sing and pick up toys 

- I’ll help you/I’ll clean while you clean. She just watches and if I stop then no one cleans (have done this mannnnyyyyy times with no luck)

- no dessert/timeout/toy timeouts/giving toys away - she could care less if the toys are gone. 

- paring the playroom down to the bare minimum. It’s pretty sparse actually and each toy is in a very specific container so they’re easy to put away. This lasts a week or two and I do a huge overhaul every month or so. Still not helping. Honestly I’d love to give them all away but she has a little brother who will use them and I doubt will be like this 

- lead by example - she’s never once volunteered to help. She’s happy to play while I clean 

- talking it out. Who made the mess, how does it make mommy feel, etc 

- rewards - stars/stickers 

- threats - today (I’m so ashamed to admit) I told her than Santa didn’t bring toys to little girls who couldn’t take care of their things and if she didn’t clean up then Santa might not bring her anything at all. 

- and the worst. Yelling. It doesn’t work, it makes all of us feel bad. Ughhh. 


Help!!! I’m at my wits end with this! Am I doomed to have a child who can’t have any toys and I’ll always have to clean up what she does have?? What have you used successfully that I haven’t listed? I’ve tried all of these techniques consistently and repeatedly with no luck.

How to address a friend bullying my daughter?,"My daughter has a friend who can be downright toxic at times.  They go through this love/hate cycle and my daughter has been coming to me to vent more and more.  Her friend, Kate, has been treating my child like crap and then will turn around and have her mom text me for play dates.  It’s getting to the point where I no longer want my daughter to uphold this friendship because I see it’s causing her too much emotional pain.  

Kate will tell my child to shut up or say that she doesn’t care when my child speaks, has even told her when to talk.  She gets another girl enlisted in her mean girl behavior and they’ll be nice one minute and the next start a fight and try to blame it on my daughter.  Shes become the scapegoat for all of Kate’s aggression.  She’s tried to tell my daughter who to be friends with and blames other kids for stealing her away.  I had to intervene last year because they were playing on Roblox and Kate was sending my daughter nasty messages (ones that I would deem as emotionally abusive and manipulative) so I intervened and then banned her from talking to them online so she wasn’t exposed to this.  I’m shocked at how she knows how to be so manipulative at their age.  They’re all ten years old.  

My daughter is a sensitive, sweet child and I feel like this makes her a good target for this girl.  She cries often about all of this.  I was looking forward to a new school year this year because they were supposed to be in separate class rooms until her mom, at the last minute, requested that her child be put in the same room as my child.  So, the bullying continues.  How do I go about this?  I told my daughter to stay away from her and the other girl.  My daughter says that they will quietly say sorry if she confronts either of them for their behavior but sooner or later, things revert back to the way that they were.  I want to contact my child’s teacher about this as well but just don’t know what to say without making my child even more of a target.  Reddit, wwyd?  TIA!",parenting

I am desperate for help with my whiny 18 month old!!!,"This is also a rant I guess because I'm losing it so it's lengthy. I really need some advice concerning my 18 month old. We just had another baby one month ago so I'm thinking that may be part of it, though generally she just doesn't pay attention to him, but she is whining ALL THE TIME. 

She whines any time we tell her no. We tried to stop saying no and just redirect and give her something else to play with. For example, if she grabs a pen from my desk and takes off running, I take the pen but give her my calculator to play with. But it's literally constant. She whines during her diaper change. She whines about the food we feed her. She whines when she wakes up and when she goes to bed. She whines when I hold her and then to be put down. She whines when I tell her no but also if I offer her something I know she likes like a cookie. She whines when I sit down to hold the baby. If I open a closet door to get something and then shut it, she whines she didn't get to go in. She wants up on the couch the cries to get down. She freaks out like crazy to have a t shirt pulled over her head. You get the idea. Since she isn't fully talking it's so difficult you know? I don't know what she wants, if this is normal, if I'm just awful at this?!?!?!

I am a stay-at-home mom and work part-time from home so I rarely get to leave the house. We only have one car right now which my husband uses to go to work and school. So we don't go out a whole lot. I try buying her toys and she prefers more household items like a spatula or something from my office area or kitchen which I generally let her have. But that only keeps her calm for a couple minutes. I thought she was teething so I give her tylenol and cold teething things I've frozen. But that doesn't seem to do anything. I thought she was jealous of the new baby, but she is doing this even when the attention is all on her. I mean I can't even sit on the toilet without her throwing a fit. 

Is this just how it is? Part of me feels like knowing this is just that terrible two stage would help, but she's not quite two yet. Part of me feels like if I knew other people had gone through it, I wouldn't feel like such a failure. I just want her to be happy but everything I do seems to make her unhappy. Meanwhile, I'm trying to care for a newborn and work. I'm not making time to take care of myself which contributes to my stress of course. My husband is generally either at work or school and at home he has to do homework but will get minimal sleep just to try and take some of the weight off of me. But that's only for a few hours each day, he's mostly gone.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong or if I'm doing something wrong. Has anyone else gone through this? Does anyone have any advice or ideas on how I can entertain her? Is this just how it is? We live in a very small town where there's not much to do anyway and the parks are kind of crap and plus I don't want to take my newborn out much if I can help it. Plus, husband doesn't get home until late so it's too dark to do things most of the time. Any activities that are cheap and will make her happy/keep her occupied? I just feel like I'm doing it wrong.

Child won't sleep in bed,"My LO, 5yo,  won't sleep in their bed or their room even.  They start the night in their room and it never fails, they wind up in the living room sleeping on the couch.

How to build a village network for my baby?,"I'm due in February  2020. 

My family is uninvolved and my in laws are very reluctant to engage with me. And it makes me feel left out, which makes me wonder, will my daughter feel this way? I dont want her to feel like she doesnt have anyone, since family support is limited.  My in laws say ""She wont be lonely, she'll have a lot of cousins"" but I dont feel reassured that they will make a good enough effort with me and my baby. 

So, I started thinking today that I need to find a way to make sure that my daughter has friends, and we have a network of people other than family that we can rely and relate to in life. I'm so sick of family disappointing us. They are unreliable emotionally. I'm lowering my expectations for them all at this point. I'm taking it into my own hands.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to find people who are also new parents? How to get your child involved with other kids? How to build a network/community that you can rely on? Or is it just going to be the 3 of us for the most part.",parenting
Sudden panic about my estranged family and my baby.,"Not sure if estranged is the right word, but when I was a toddler my biological mother packed up and moved across the country to live with her parents and supposedly get help with her alcohol addiction. Long story short her contact was about once every 5 years, and a couple birthday cards here or there throughout my childhood, along with lots of empty promises about recovery and reuniting. As an adult we now have absolutely no relationship and my last message to her ended with ""do not contact me again"" so, it didn't go well. 


I was just thinking about when my daughter's old enough to understand that her grandma is actually my step-mom and that I don't have a relationship with her biological grandmother, or that side of my family at all. I don't plan to hide this information from her so she'll be fully aware of this as she grows up. I'm just concerned about that side of the family reaching out to my daughter in the future considering they're strangers to me and I don't have an interest in reconciliation with any of them. 


I'm also trying to come to terms with the possibility that my daughter may want to get to know my biological mom or people on that side of the family even though it would hurt me immensely. I don't want to stop my daughter from meeting this side of the family- as an adult if she chooses too, but, especially meeting my biological mom would be painful for me.


I'm not even sure what I'm trying to ask here, just for advice about this situation in general. If anyone has experience being in mine or my daughters' position I'd love to know how you felt/what you did. Even if you don't have any experience with this, maybe how you think you'd react could help me. I thought about blocking the few people I'm online friends with from that side of the family, because I don't have any sort of relationship with them, they're just sort of there. But I don't want to be irrational about this. Technically they've done nothing wrong, they're just strangers to me.",parenting

I’m failing parenting,So as the title above I feel as I’m failing parenting. I lost my apartment a couple months back due to me losing my job and me and my husband are going through a divorce. It’s been a rough past few months. Anyways we have a beautiful four year old together that I’ve been moving from our apartment to his mothers house and my own mothers house ( starting the divorce) . My mothers husband has given me a week to leave there house due to them not expecting me and not being able to make room. I’m frantic and I’m depressed. I’ve been taking my daughter biking to the park to leave the house and try to clear my heads but sometimes she still catches me crying and asks me what’s wrong. I’m going to be homeless in exactly a week and I feel as if my life is plummeting down hill and I can’t keep up. I don’t know what to do or what do think. The housing shelters besides me are at full capacity and I wanted to keep in my location due to my daughter going to afternoon school here. I’m very sorry for venting but it’s something I need to get off my head.,parenting
People invading your kids/your family’s privacy to “ moon over” your child. Where do you draw the line? Am I just being uptight?,"I am admittedly a VERY private person. In fact my husband and I both are. Meaning, we don’t post pictures on social media. We don’t share our birthdays with others. We aren’t fans of PDA. Etc etc. we are both introverted. And prefer to not be the center of attention. 

Anyway- it really bothers me when people approach me when I’m with my kids (4, and 1) and just go on and on about how cute they are. And want to take pictures of them. Or even worse touch their hair or something. 

I’m asking this because today, we went out to coffee at my husbands work. And a woman he works with (they aren’t close by any means) approaches us SEVERAL times to comment on how cute our daughter is, and touches her, then takes pictures of her. Which to me, is weird! Even more odd, tells us that we should have another baby and give the baby to her. 

I know she is harmless and just being weird. But this is so odd to me!! I guess I have extremely high boundaries and am very closed off in general which I’m sure plays a part in me being uncomfortable. 

But- I don’t get it? I guess what I truly don’t understand is why people treat children like they aren’t the same as an adult, meaning. You wouldn’t walk up to a random person, touch them, comment on how beautiful they are and take their picture. Now, if you did. It would be creepy!! So why isn’t it also creepy to do this to a child? 

I wish I had the guts to just say hey that’s weird can you give us space. But I have social anxiety and clam up at confrontation. 😓

Needing help with angry child,"My 12 year old gets angry at himself either when playing video games or sporting events or homework and other activities. He gets upset enough that he kicks out or throws his controller. Sometimes he'll grab his arms or tug at his hair. Then he gets overwhelmed or we get on to him about taking a timeout or cooling off or stepping away and then he starts crying. He recently told me he feels overwhelmed and angry and sometimes he needs to unleash some anger out. 

My mom has had clinical depression for as long as I can remember and a year or two ago she made am off hand comment that has stuck with me ever since. She said she worries he might have the same depression she has and she sees similarities and signs she had when she was younger. 

I try to talk with him about his feelings but I don't know that I'm actually helping him. I'm so scared and worried because you hear all these stories about kids doing dangerous things to themselves or others and I don't want to be one of those parents that think ""that's not my son"". My spouse seems to think we just don't discipline him enough or that I'm too soft on him, which I'm definitely the less strict of us two compared to her.

Is finding a therapist the only recourse or do we have any other options? He's mentioned before that he doesn't want to go to a therapist, he somehow already thinks there's a stigma associated with going. 

He reached out to me today while I'm at work and told me he thinks he broke his controller and that he is sorry that he gets frustrated. I just don't know what to do to help him besides being there to talk to him. I don't know what to say to help him and I'm starting to get frustrated at myself as well for feeling like I can't help my child.",parenting

Advice needed for handing over childcare responsibilities for toddler to spouse.,"I'm currently a stay at home mom to our 20 month old daughter and 9 months pregnant. I'm getting more and more nervous about my plan once the baby is born. My husband really stepped up when our first child was born. But once he went back to work, 2 weeks after the birth, I was the primary caregiver as a stay at home mom. And it has stayed that way for 20 months. I'm nervous that when the baby is here, my toddler's needs will be neglected. 

My husband has saved all of his time off, so we should have about 5 weeks. I've told him I really want to breastfeed successfully this time, so I want to focus on the baby during that time. I want him to be the one responsible for our toddler's needs for those 5 weeks. But I'm not sure what to do to prepare him. When he's off on weekends, we don't have our typical routine, because we're usually trying to visit friends and family. So he's not super familiar with our current routine. Our toddler does not verbalize that she is hungry or tired. I have a schedule that's more activity based than time based. For instance, in the morning whenever she wakes up I change her diaper, we go downstairs, she helps me with the dogs, then we eat breakfast, and after breakfast I change her outfit. On the weekends, if I ask my husband to get up with our daughter he does not feed her breakfast (unless I specifically tell him to) or change her outfit. She usually is just playing. When I ask him why she hasn't had breakfast he will say ""she didn't seem hungry."" I don't want to criticize him, but I think after 10 hours of sleep she is probably hungry. (In general, I can definitely be overly critical, and I like things done my way.) When I went to a class at 11:30 yesterday, he put the toddler down for a nap without giving her lunch first. She slept her normal 3 hours meaning when she woke up she hadn't eaten in 6 hours, to me that is too long. 

Can anyone relate to this situation? What ideas do you have for easing this transition? What should I do to prepare him? How do I give up this control? 

Thanks in advance for your help. I'm running out of time. Sorry for any errors. I am using my cell phone. 

TLDR: My husband will be taking over my SAHM responsibilities with our daughter (20 months old) for 5 weeks after our baby is born, and I need advice on preparing him and myself for this transition.",parenting

Six month old is becoming very clingy,"I know the title sounds bad.. but here’s the whole thing. I have two kids both girls one is two and the other is just shy of 6 months. 

My youngest has hated her car seat since day one. She will scream and scream and scream. We all live in a isolated area so driving is a must for everything (45 minutes to an hour). I can’t seem to get her to just be calm. I’ve done the white noise maker, music, singing, toys, mirrors, and even little pillow things to go on the straps (totally safe). Last night it was so bad that I had to give her my bra (my friend was keeping an eye on her to make sure she was okay). She is breastfed so I figured that would calm her down, which it did. For 20 minutes, then the screaming started again. It usually happens in the evening. When I pick her up, she stops instantly and is fine. 

Also for the past week she hasn’t been letting me put her down for naps either. I have to hold her the whole time or she just won’t nap, if I put her down she starts screaming again. The nap thing is very sudden. 

Ive tried the whole cry it out thing a few times but she will cry for 30 minutes straight. Most likely more if I’d let her. 

Now why this is a problem because driving with a screaming baby is stressful, my husband is deployed and when he returns I’m going back to work and I don’t want her to completely lose and feel betrayed when that happens. 

Two things, she won’t take a pacifier (she just chews on it and spits it out), also she is nursed to sleep. 

Any advice?",parenting
Thoughts on telling children what I can and can't afford...,"What are your thoughts on telling the children ""we can't afford this right now?"" 

Mine are 6m and 7f and I have used that as an explanation of why we were unable to do something. I received some comments from family and friends saying it was inappropriate to have the children worry about money. It's not essentials, it's extra snacks or happy meals or stuff like that. I am co-parenting and we have a pretty good relationship as things go...but I make more money than their Dad so often times we (me and the children) have ""treats"" such as maybe having a family dinner at Chili's once a month...but I try not to spoil them and some weeks are harder than other depending upon if their Dad gives money towards the stuff such as children's lunches, snacks or buys bottled water...but I digress...

Either way I feel they are an appropriate age to know reasons why instead of the ""because I said no"" because frankly I hate hearing that and try not to say it. I try to help them understand cause and effect and if I can give them a reason I do so. Do y'all think that causes children more stress?",parenting
Headstrong 4 year old testing us - cursing and won't eat or sleep,"My oldest will be 5 next week. Call him K.

K did not sleep a straight night until he was 2.5, and made us change three sleep counselors. He was always a picky slim eater being at the bottom 5% of weight curves while expending huge amount of energy, running nearly constantly from 6 am to 8 pm. He always wants to win, and loses his temper as the slightest sign of difficulty - blaming everyone but himself and hitting his little (2.5) sister.
On the other side he is super sweet, and whip-smart, already talking in two languages, knowing all their letters, counting (with great patience) up to 1000, and doing basic addition and subtraction. When he wants to be good he helps out his little sister and also in our housework. 

Now we are really in trouble, as he has learned to rationally weaponize all of his negative traits in a calculated manner. 

Food: He will not eat when he is upset with us, even for a whole day - he knows he is skinny and borderline problematic nutritionally and that it drives us and his grandparents nuts no matter how much we try to hide it. He makes sure to eat nicely in kindergarten and leaves the warring for the weekends. 

Sleep: He will wake us up repeatedly in the middle of the night with excuses such as being afraid of the dark (he isn't) which he heard other kids talk about in kindergarten. Also - starts banging on the walls at 0530.

Winning: He will speak inappropriately to us (""shut up"" , ""I hate you"", ""I am leaving the house until you give me X"") whenever he trips on his bicycle, loses a round in a card game, or has to go out when he does not want to. He then will stay angry for hours and not respond to calming attemts, even kicking and hitting, unless we put down huge threat (e.g. ""If you don't calm down by the count of 10 I am throwing your bicycle away"" ) in case which he calms right down, apologizes and goes back to being sweet and calm. 
We realize it is normal but he is really grinding us down. 

If anyone has good experience with handling such a child, I would like to hear.

When did pumpkin patches get so expensive?,"So today I wanted to take the kiddos to the pumpkin patch. I have a 4 year old and 6 month old. The last couple years we went to pumpkin patch out near my grandparents(4 hours away in the middle of nowhere) and spent about $30 on pumpkins and a few activities(petting zoo, endless barrel train rides, hay ride, corn pool, corn maze and playground) and snacks. So it wasn’t bad. My grandpa passed this year and grandma is sick so we aren’t doing this anymore so we looked into the 3 pumpkin patches near us(within 45 mins). Holy fuck expensive. They all cost $20 per person(under 1 is free) so that’s $60 just to get in(husband me and daughter). With your entrance fee you get one barrel train ride, a hay ride to the patch, the corn maze, petting zoo, corn pool(basically corn kernels in a pool you can dig in) and the playground. Extra stuff is more then one barrel train ride, the carousel, petting zoo food, pony rides(so probably another $10 on this crap). Then pumpkins range from $10-$50 a piece(probably will spend $20). Then they don’t allow any food or drink so you know we will spend at least $20 on that since my daughter can’t go more then 5 mins without eating and drinking like any 4 year old lol. So this whole trip will cost $110(if not more)! On top of this we will probably only stay maybe 2/3 hours because 6 month old will get cranky. So needless to say we are probably skipping it this year! Who the hell can afford this crap? Why are they so expensive!",parenting

Experiences with raising a multilingual child? (4 different languages),"I've been doing some research on this and also watched some Youtube videos of parents describing how they raised a multilingual child, but I would really like some additional perspectives as well. Apologies for the long post--I tried to fit in all relevant details.

**Background:** we live in Canada which has two official languages, English and French, so we want our child to learn both. My husband and I are very comfortable in English (neither of us learned it as our first language but we did learn it when very young and have obviously used it the most in day-to-day life for the majority of our lives so this is definitely the language we are both most comfortable in). Unfortunately we both have only basic knowledge of French (OK with reading but really terrible at speaking/listening, basically can't hold much of a conversation) and this is something we both regret so we want our child to learn it. We also live very close to both sets of parents who do speak English to varying degrees but are by far most comfortable speaking their native language (we'll call these language C and language D). They are definitely eager to help us take care of our child and will almost definitely be speaking their mother tongue rather than English, which is great because I definitely want to expose our child to multiple languages but at the same time, I'm worried it's going to be too much. Note that my husband and I do not understand each other's native language.

**Our Strategy:**

\- Since my husband and I speak English to each other all the time, and this is the primary language where we live, we aren't concerned about this. I expect baby will be able to pick it up from interacting with us as well as at playgroups and other little kids when they are older.

\- When it is just me and the baby, I plan on speaking language C 100% of the time. I will be taking mat leave of 12-18 months (haven't yet decided exactly how long) while my husband will be working full-time for most of that duration (he'll just have a few weeks paternity leave) so I will be doing the majority of the childcare. Question though, which option is best: option 1 is to only speak language C when it's just me &amp; baby at home, switching to English when my husband comes home. Option 2 would be I speak language C to the baby all the time, but the baby would obviously also overhear me speaking a lot of English when I'm speaking directly to my husband. Option 2 would expose the child to more of the language, but may be too confusing (both for me and baby) if I'm constantly switching back and forth when Dad is home. Also I don't want my husband to feel left out because we are talking in a language he doesn't understand while he's around.

\- When baby is with the grandparents, they will be exposed to more of language C (with my parents) and language D (with husband's parents). I expect that they will spend a lot more time with the grandparents after my mat leave is finished and I go back to work.

\- When our child starts full-day kindergarten (\~4.5yo), we are hoping to enroll them in a French school so that they are able to learn French as well. Before that they probably will have very minimal experience with French, although I am considering reading some French children's books to them at a younger age or maybe introducing some simple French songs. Not sure if this would be too much on top of the other 3 languages they are already trying to learn though? Ideally by the time they start kindergarten they would have a fairly good grasp of the other 3 languages so I'm hoping the addition of French at this age would be manageable.

\- I have also been a bit worried that the child may not be able to learn language D because their exposure to this would be much less than to English &amp; language C. My husband and I have both decided that this would be the ""least important"" language anyways (aka it'll be great if our child can learn it, but if it comes down to it we would rather them focus on the other ones). However, I don't want to make my in-laws feel bad that they can't communicate with their grandchild as well as my parents can. I have been considering asking my husband speak to the child in language D instead of English to increase exposure, but this might result in a rather chaotic household with 3 languages flying around constantly! (Me + baby = language C, Dad + baby = language D, me + Dad = English...it would take some getting used to for sure for all of us! And I would also be concerned that English would suffer since baby would only overhear it when me + Dad are talking, plus I guess when we bring them to playgroups/activities.)

**Concerns:** I have heard that babies and young children are amazing at picking up new languages, but is 4 languages at virtually the same time too much? I don't want to overwhelm or confuse our child! Especially since I don't think either my husband and I are very good at learning new languages (we each learned our native language as a baby, picked up English as a young child, and that was it--we've both been terrible at trying to pick up French, so languages definitely aren't something that come ""naturally"" to us like it does for some people!).

Would love to hear experiences from other people--how well did your child adapt, were you able to realize if they were getting too confused and sort of ""pull back"", any other strategies we should be looking into? Should we try to focus on only two languages at the beginning? Or do three off the bat? Should we even attempt to introduce a bit of the 4th language (French) at a young age or just forget about that one until they start school?

Thank you!

"What's bugging my 5 year old?! HSP, Indigo, SPD, HELP!","I am writing this from a place of desperation, as I am sure many parents do. I have three sons. C (9), R (5) and B (2).

C was a super tough first child. He had heart surgery when he was 1 month old, and starting at the age of 2 has been diagnosed with Level 1 ASD and ADHD. We worked with so many behavioral specialists and he had an aide in his mainstream classroom until the middle of his 2nd grade year. He is thriving and well adjusted. We have minimal concerns at this point, aside from him ""flexing"" his attitude occasionally, and some stimming.

R is 5. He is a case of extremes. He is so loving and loves touching and cuddling and hugs. He has an amazing ear for sound imitation and loves to make-believe. He is sensitive and thoughtful.

He also screeches, hits, spits, scribbles, yells, and hides multiple times a day for seemingly NOTHING. He has EXTREME sensitivity to clothing, tags, ""bumpy"" socks, pants, long sleeves, etc...

It is like walking on eggshells and we are starting to allow him to terrorize us out of exhaustion. It is hard for him to play outside because he ends up just SCREAMING at his friends. He also seems to have hearing difficulty but has passed all hearing screenings and like I said before, has a great ear for imitation. He asks the same questions over and over like he didn't hear us. ""Is it a school day?"" ""No, It is Saturday, not a school day."" ""Is it a school day today?"" over and over again.

He is really expressive, but little things set him off into a downward spiral of misbehavior. If he gets surprised or embarrassed, he will dive under a table and screech at us, spit, and call us stupid. We will give space and go about our business, or sometimes try and gently coax him. When it is an ""automatic time out"" situation (in our house that is spitting, hitting, or saying ""shut up"" and the like) we use the Parent Child Interactive Therapy ""PCIT"" training we received with C. See this article so I don't have to type it all out: [http://pcit.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Section-6\_PDI-Teaching.pdf](http://pcit.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Section-6_PDI-Teaching.pdf)  (page 9/18 goes through time out sequence). He just walks up to B, his 2 year old brother, and screams as loud as he can in his face during a calm TV watching or play session. He is ALWAYS the one to ""take it to the next level"". He loves praise and being helpful, and complimented. He is always the first to come over to me or my husband and hug one of us even if our tone changes, so he does pick up on subtleties unlike his older brother who is very thick with social situations.

We are at an impasse, he cannot continue to escalate and I'm not sure where to go from here. I have been consuming information on Sensory Processing Disorder, Highly Sensitive Children, and even ""Indigo Kids"" (mini eye roll, but I'm open minded to most anything..). He just seems ANGRIER than all those ""diagnosed disorders"" I mentioned. I need help in finding some answers, if there is anyone out there with knowledge or experience, PLEASE HELP!

I’m jealous of people who get to go on date with their spouse.,"I (30F) was just scrolling through fb and seen another mom post “Date with the hubby, 3 months was just way too long!” along with a picture of them happily smiling and her thanking somebody for watching their son. It’s their first kid and both of them are also 30 like me and their son is about 18 mo old like mine. I don’t know why but I get so jealous. We have 3 kids and the older two are 10 and 8 and then we have the baby. Me and my husband haven’t had a date since before he was born and I haven’t hade time  to myself since I had the flu back in March and my mother in law took the baby so he wouldn’t get sick.

Need advice for difficult 3.5yr old son who has trouble playing nicely with others,"My son is the difficult kid that you don't want to invite over to hang. He hits and screams and generally distrusts other kids. He likes parents more than kids. He has a massive temper and often says, ""I'm so angry"". He's very loving with us and often randomly says, ""Love you mommy! Love you daddy!"", but is either unwilling, unable or uninterested in playing with other kids. He only gets along with a few kids, so it's putting a lot of pressure on my wife (stay home mom) and limiting the mom friends she can make. He was slow to speak and seemed behind other kid's motor skills (couldn't walk up/down stairs like his friends etc.) so we enrolled him in 2-3 days preschool. His speaking and motor skills improved a ton and teachers say he's normal, but he's still the difficult kid (screams, gets angry easily, returns ""Hi!"" with a scowl). On top of all this he's very sensitive and timid. He's afraid to go down bounce house slides, very sensitive to loud sounds (toilet flushing, hand dryers in bathrooms). We're doing a good job disciplining him and keeping him on a regular schedule, spending time together, reading books etc. We're great at home, but when he gets around other kids it's almost always a problem. I'm really surprised he doesn't have more trouble at preschool. It's like when he's around us, he turns into a baby. We also have a 9mo old daughter who he's not crazy about, so that explains some of the wanting to revert to being a baby. My wife is Japanese and speaks mostly Japanese to him, so I thought that might be a reason he's behind, but he's the same with other kids with the same situation. Would really appreciate advice from parents who have been through it with the ""odd one out"" child. Thank you.",parenting
Suggestions for helping baby sleep safely?,"Do you all have any suggestions for how to make a baby feel snuggled when he’s lying on his back to sleep?

Our baby strongly prefers to sleep when he is feeling cuddled / snug. However, we have read again and again that putting him in a seat or rocking swing or sitting upright on a pillow is dangerous. Only lying on the back is deemed safe. The problem then is it’s hard to make him feel snug and cuddled when he’s on his back. So either the options become hold him 24/7 and never sleep, or risk putting him in an unsafe position. If we do let him fall asleep in a more snuggled setup, we then try to move him to a safer position on his back but he often wakes up.

Any suggestions for how to safely make him cozy while lying on his back would be greatly appreciated! Thanks",parenting
My child refuses to seek help for her weight issues or her mental health,"(throw away account) 

I'm a single mum on a low income. My teenage daughter is overweight and suffers from depression and social anxiety. I've previously taken her to the doctors, seen a nutritionalist with her and sought her counselling. Counselling worked briefly, but she didn't see it all the way through. She couldn't stick to the diet from the nutritionalist, and would end up binge eating when she got upset about something.

She says she wants to change but she refuses to go back to the doctor, nutritionalist, or counsellor. 

I've tried locking up food in the pantry, but that didn't work, she would just raid the fridge when I'm sleeping. I can't currently afford a physical hobby for her or a gym membership. I can't even get her to go for a walks with me. She's physically bigger than me so I can't physically force her to go to appointments. 

She's blaming me for her current predicament, and says I won't help her, despite constant attempts to get help for her. I feel like she is refusing to help herself and is blaming me so she doesn't have to take responsibility for her own behaviour and actions.

I don't know what to do. If I don't help her I'm a bitch, and if I do help her, she refuses to be helped.

TL;DL teenager daughter is suffering with mental health and weight issues, refuses to get help, is blaming me and accusing me of not helping her despite all efforts to the contrary.",parenting
"Youngest does not have a baby book, WWYD?","My older children all have baby books. When my oldest children headed out to college, I found myself pregnant by surprise. I did have a 4 and 6 yr old at the time, and they have baby books. When my youngest was born, my thoughts were that these days, people do digital books, not baby books. So I did not get him one.

The other day, he found out his siblings have baby books. They also have keepsake boxes, but after the youngest of his older siblings were born, the grandparents died off. Many of the things in the keep sake box came from grandparents, such as special grandchild jewelry and cards and such. It also included the stuff from the hospital, which I do have for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go ahead with my plan to make a digital book and have it printed? Or should I seek out a baby book like I can write in so it is like his siblings? I do not want him to feel less loved. But a baby born in 1994 is a little bit different from a baby born in 2015. Although, I will say, the handwritten baby books were easier to do than the digital books.",parenting
4 year old enjoys killing animals in Minecraft. Should I be worried?,"Apologies for phone format. 

My two boys (4&amp;6) have always loved playing video games. My husband loves them and so he introduced them to video games as soon as he could. I started to be troubled when my younger son (now 4) would talk about killing the bad guys a lot. Coming from such a young mouth it made me uneasy. He was mostly playing games like Sonic and Mario but a big part of each of those games is the killing of the “bad guys”. While both of my boys would talk about how they had to kill the bad guys, I found the way that my younger son talked about it to be a bit unsettling. He just seemed so excited by it. 

So my husband and I limited them to Minecraft on peaceful mode. This was the most calm and non violent game that we could find. But now he spends his time on that game creating animals or zombies and then killing them. He barely even builds anything. He just creates a bunch of animals and creatures and calls them bad guys then spends his time killing them. My husband and I are very unsettled by this and don’t know if it’s really an issue or if we’re over reacting. 

He has never really shown any violence towards animals in real life. He actually loves animals! He gets excited to pet any dog or cat that he sees and is always gentle. He will squish a spider or big from time to time, but nothing too serious. 

Am I overreacting? Is this normal behavior or should I do something?",parenting
Had my first night(s) away from my kid since birth and...it. Was. Amazing.,"My little is 1.5 yo and we sent her to Gma/Gpa’s farm for the weekend. I didn’t know how badly I needed this time away from her. Being alone with my husband felt like we were young again- not mama and dada with serious responsibilities/obligations. We did nothing special but have loved every minute. Slept in, went for out for every meal (nothing fancy) without planning ahead, took our dog for long walks to the park. Want to take a nap? Why yes I do! Want to get lunch somewhere and not shovel our food in before the toddler time-bomb goes off? Yes please! Let’s get mani/pedis after lunch! Another nap? Ok! The only unfortunate thing is I couldn’t indulge in wine with lunch because I’m pregnant again. Another reason my husband and I really needed this time quality time though. I’m disappointed I waited this long to take a breather from our 1st. It’s easier said than done but we need to do this once a quarter. I felt like myself today- the girl who has few cares in the world and enjoys sitting quietly in the sun well after we’re done eating- just relaxing and talking about nothing of consequence. Can’t wait to spend one more slow morning with coffee in bed before she comes home. I love her with everything I have but I forgot how much I like my life sans kid. I’ve gotta be better to myself and my relationship with my husband.",parenting
My husband can’t be there for me,"I have been talking about wanting to apply for a writing program which would require 2 residencies per year, 2 weeks each. I have told him about how I feel uneasy leaving my daughter without me and he has said he could take vacation weeks on those weeks. Last month he told me out of the blue that he was applying for a program in his field, which also requires residencies on or overlapping with the same dates as the ones I want to go to. Of course he got in. He’s a doctor and his program would help him go up to management so he would make more money. I can’t say the same for my program since writers don’t make much money. Im angry that he doesn’t care that he just dismissed my goals for his own when this has been something I’ve been talking about for the past year. I have put aside my entire life for the past 3 years to raise our daughter and he has done basically nothing but bring home money, which he would do if he wasn’t married.
I don’t know if I can handle 2 years of putting aside my goals so he can do his degree. He said if I get into a program he can defer but I don’t even think he’s being honest about that. I think he assumes I won’t get in because I have talked it down but my teachers have told me I have the chops. 
I don’t know how to go about this. He knows that if I do get in and make him defer, I’ll just feel guilty about it, he relies on my guilt to get what he wants. He always has. I can’t believe he is so selfish.",parenting

Do you think the doctor would call in the medicine and we could bring her in tomorrow morning? There is no denying the cough.
Meanwhile as I’m up minimally clothed moving her to the couch someone starts knocking at the door. It’s 3 something in the morning and we live in the middle of nowhere Ohio pocket “town”  with a mailing address of a slightly bigger village about 5 miles away. I freak out and wake my husband.

I watched as my husband and daughter were almost run over by a car,"This is a bit of a rant but it just happened not too long ago and I’m still reeling from it, so I really need to vent.

My husband and I took our daughter (2 years, 9 months old) to the mall this evening. He held her in his arms and I told him to go ahead of me (he’s a fast walker) because it was getting late and pretty chilly outside. So he walks ahead of me and I watch as he crosses the crosswalk to go into the mall. There’s a car parallel parked to the curb, right in front of the crosswalk, who suddenly jerks backwards and starts reversing into my husband and daughter. He’s walking at an angle with his hip/back to the car so he can’t see. I scream for my husband’s attention but he doesn’t hear me. Then the driver hits my husband as I’m running and screaming trying to get both of their attention. After he was hit, my husband turns his head and sees he’s about to be run over if he doesn’t move so he jumps out of the way. This happened in a matter of seconds. Luckily, the hit didn’t knock him over and he was still standing - it wasn’t a light hit but he’s 6 ft and 190 lbs, which I think helped him not fall over easily... if it were me, it probably would’ve knocked me off my feet.

After my husband moves out of the way, the driver (we can see now it’s a young woman) continues to reverse. She finally stops the car. My husband and I are in shock. We knock on her passenger side window. She puts the window down and my husband asks, “did you not see me?” She’s completely oblivious and replies, “no, I didn’t see you.” At this point, my husband and I are staring into her car which has a large screen in the center showing her backup camera feed. The woman quickly drove away before we regained our composure, so we didn’t get her information or anything. 

I can’t believe that she backed up into the crosswalk and didn’t bother to look at her mirrors or backup camera. Had the hit knocked my husband and daughter over, she would’ve ran over them with her car. Or worse - had my daughter been walking (she usually does holding our hand), she would’ve been hit and probably ended up under the car. 

My husband was shaken up from the hit but says he’s fine. My daughter is fine and thankfully the car never made contact with her. But I can’t get over how careless this woman was. This is an extremely busy mall and we went right before closing so it wasn’t as busy as it usually is... but any other time and there’s no doubt people would’ve been injured. I’m just upset at the fact that she could’ve injured a father and his child and didn’t so much as apologize or ask if they were okay.

So a PSA to parents: be aware of your surroundings in mall parking lots or high traffic areas. Even when you’re being careful and crossing at a crosswalk and looking both ways - doing everything right - it doesn’t mean that you’re completely safe. Stay alert! Teach your children how important it is that they keep their eyes and ears open.",parenting

3 year old ran off to the park behind our house all by himself this evening...,"And the dog and 1.5 year old ran after him. 

We were cleaning up after supper, sink faucet running. Kids were  running all around the house, playing downstairs minutes before, but when we noticed things had gotten quiet we checked and they weren't downstairs, the back door was open.  And the back gate too. Our backyard is directly alongside a walking path, 2 backyards away from a fairly well known playground.

We RAN to that park ASAP to find the toddler at the playground and then looking around for a bit we discovered the 3yo a bit further away with the dog on the path to another cul-de-sac, a lady and her kids corralling them back to the park.  Omfg. Words cannot describe the utter panic we felt. I'm still overwhelmed with anxiety.  I'm still horrified.

The 3yo did this only once before at about 2 years old. We were getting ready to go to the park with the new baby and I was doing a diaper change on the 6m old. My oldest boy opened the back door and gate himself and ran to the park, letting the dog out with him. When I realized he'd gone outside AND let himself out the back gate I left the baby on the floor to run and grab the dog (enjoying leash free romping) and the kid, hauled them back, told him not to do that, very bad, he has to have have one of us with him if he wants to go to the park.  Then I locked the gate, brought him inside and told him to wait while I to go get the baby carrier.   In the mere moments that passed, he'd gone back out the door, climbed over the 4ft chain link fence gate (!!!), and was running to the park barefoot. I hauled him back immediately again and lectured him, and punished him with a time out, very clearly telling him he had to have mommy or daddy with him to go to the park. He has not done this again until now.

This time the now-toddler went too, along with the dog, no shoes on either kid. We gave both kids a real talking to, and promptly hauled them home to go straight to bed.  The 3 year old understands when he's done a bad thing, and what it means to be angry and scared, and the concept of waiting, and asking for something, and so-on.  Husband has talked to the 3yo again before a final tuck-in about why what he did was bad. I'm going to talk to him again tomorrow morning.  

Our kids both run around the whole house throughout  the day. Up and down stairs, little whirlwinds. If we notice silence we hustle to find them right away. The 3 year old can open our back door, it's a slide door with a latch. He's very capable of unlocking it and sliding it open as letting the dog in/out is his job.  The back gate is usually very hard for ME to open, it shifts position depending on the soil moisture.  Right now it's very dry and happens to be a looser fit.  This summer we spent a lot of time in the backyard and at that park as a family, they feel like it's an extension of our backyard. But we don't ever let them go to the park by themselves, and we have told them so many many times. They've pulled at the back gate to indicate they want to go, but haven't tried to go by themselves since the older one went that one time a year ago.

The older kid is usually pretty good, pretty capable of being reasoned with for a 3yo, displaying empathy well enough and all those signs of general rational and emotional intelligence. But he is very high energy (from what other people have observed), and occasionally pretty bad impulse control (again he's just turned 3).   Usually something is destroyed when it gets quiet. We are not in the habit of leaving our kids playing unattended in another room or outside by themselves for significant periods of time. 

Ugh. I feel like the worst mom. Incredibly lucky nothing bad happened.  But still crashing hard at the anxiety of what could have happened, why we didn't notice immediately. What a nightmare. 

I know I should have some confidence that talking to my kid about it will stop him from doing it again. I'm hopeful I won't have to worry about it happening again, because he's becoming competent enough to understand when we explain things to him with reasoning and empathy. And when we are 100% serious about how bad/scary something is/was. 

I just really needed to vent. When I mentioned the first time the eldest did it, people said they've never had that kind of problem with their kids... And it's just so isolating, I feel so helpless and sunk right now.",parenting
My son only wants mama,"My son (3) is going through a phase where he only wants to interact with my wife. He's been sick and when he wakes up in the night I go to him.

I know it's a phase he's going through, but it hurts. I broke down last night after being screamed at and hearing my wife trying to get him to apologise and him flat out refusing. He was a little nicer when he saw me crying, but not by much.

My son is afraid to play with his toys because of a bad decision on my part.,"My son is 5 and for most of his life we have had a blast playing action figures.  He would beg me to play them every night.  About 8 months ago, that stopped.  He was really into Paw Patrol at the time, and had recently added new toys to his collection.  He brought one to school for show and yell and then kind of lost interest in the show and toys shortly after.  I figured he was outgrowing it as it is geared toward pre-k.  Come to find out, one of the kids at school told him his toy was a baby toy- the ultimate insult.  I was pretty upset as I felt my bonding time was taken away from me.  Some time passed and he did watch the show a bit more and I would break out the toys, and come up with the scenario for the night.  He would start, and then backed off.  If he was playing with a character he would not pretend they were talking. This was a new weird thing.  I could not figure out why, until tonight. After asking him why he wouldn’t let the characters talk, I got out that he is afraid of them coming to life. 

Here’s why: He LOVES Halloween and about 6 months ago,  I saw a Halloween movie on Netflix and did not preview or research it before watching it with him. The movie was Goosebumps and was rated PG.  There is a talking dummy in the movie.  Taking him to see Toy Story did not help.  I really messed up and now my kid is afraid of toys with faces.  He’ll play with trains, legos, blocks, etc. but no faces.  I am devestated because I really feel like I failed him.  How can I begin helping him deal with his fear of toys coming to life? Is it time for therapy?",parenting

"I made a mean face at my two year old until she came to me for a hug, her way of making it okay, and I gently held her back and stepped around her, making her cry, because she nearly killed our bird","I only refused the hug for a second before I gave in to comfort her and I told her she has to listen when i tell her to leave the bird alone.

I was in the bathroom getting ready for bed and I didnt realize the cat was in the house. I move the bird from her spot in the window to my bedroom at night, for her safety. Until today nothing ever happened but I'm paranoid. 

I heard my daughter messing with the cage and I called to her twice to leave the bird alone. Again, I didn't think it was a big deal because I didn't know the cat was inside.

I heard silence for a moment and thought she had left the bird alone. Then I hear the bird squeal in a way I've never heard before. I rush into the room and I see the cat, my daughter is pointing at the cat saying ""white! White!"" Bird is nowhere to be seen. I scream at the cat to get out and I turn on my daughter and I screamed at her, admittedly. I never scream so I dont know how she wasn't bothered but it wasn't until I exhibited a few seconds of coldness that it seemed to dawn on her what she might have done. Its only when someone could get seriously hurt that I yell. If I'm getting annoyed I get quiet and short. Never yell.

I located the bird, who was fine, just shaken up. I told my daughter as I comforted her after I made her cry that she could have hurt the bird and I asked her if she will listen when I say to leave the bird alone. Into my neck, she nodded her head. So I think the shame worked more than yelling did.

I feel like an asshole. Its *my* fault she had access to the bird. I cant remember if my bedroom door was open or not. I feel like an asshole for yelling and I feel like an asshole for being cold to her for even a few seconds.  

I mean, obviously now I know I need to put a safety knob on the door and a mini lock for the cage. My daughter is young enough perhaps she wont remember this and eventually time will make my guilt less potent but right now I feel like a jerk.",parenting
Can I get some props for me - or my toddler? - one of us is CLEARLY amazing (proud/humblebrag),"My son is 2 years, 10 months. I have him full time, SAHM.  


In February I was signing up for a community workspace membership and went, ""Welp, we're just gonna have to teach you to be good at entertaining yourself while I laser engrave kiddo."" And after a few visits, he adapted to the place, and it's wonderful. 

Over the last few months I've been working on more toddler independence for him in a variety of ways, and I've really found that if I give him opportunities, he has a chance to live/work up to them.  


So today, we went to an organic apple orchard where I'd picked apples years ago. I wanted to try picking apples with him - because it's rare to be able to work WITH your kid in tow, and because I wanted to see if it would work for us two. I had no idea how it was going to go. Would he get bored after 10 minutes? Would he run off?   


No and no! I picked apples for THREE HOURS and kiddo was great until the very end (which would have been nap time, had he not stopped napping two weeks ago). I am so proud that I risked the embarrassment/disappointment of failure and gave it a try! He was plenty entertained with what I brought for him. He mostly climbed up the back of my ladder, and insisted he wanted to pick apples as well. He was bummed I wouldn't sit to read books with him on the blanket.  


I just feel like I have the best toddler ever, and I feel so lucky that I got to have that experience with him. And I feel like it's so great that he had three hours to practice being with himself, but in a fantastic location, and with me right there whenever he needed mom again.

Parents on a budget. Tips?,"Hey everyone,

"What, if any, rules do you have for your older teens when it comes to dating?","My oldest, who just turned 17, is on her first date. The guy is someone she has known since elementary school and he lives on our block. His little brothers are friends with my boys and our families know each other pretty well. He is a senior and she is a junior, but they are only 5 months apart in age. 

They spend a lot of time together. They do Speech and Debate together. She goes to his soccer games and he comes to her field hockey games. They have a class together (AP Bio) and spend time at each others houses. That is where one of our issues comes into play. 

We have never made them leave the door open before. We have 5 kids and they have friends over a lot because once your house reaches a certain volume, a few more kids doesn't hurt. So shutting the door is the only way to get some peace in a loud house. He is the oldest of 4 and my daughter says they aren't allowed to shut the door at his house, so that is probably why they spend more time here. Should we change that rule now? 

We are very open when it comes to sex and my daughter said that she is no where near ready for that yet. She doesn't want to go on birth control because she isn't sexually active and doesn't want to worry about the hormonal affects. I am a firm believer in her body, her choice but should we push this more? 

He drives and has access to a car, but we haven't let her ride in his car yet. They haven't needed to yet. They live close enough to walk to each others houses. I dropped her off at the movies today. They are doing a Halloween event at their school for their club but plan on walking home in a group so they can trick or treat on the way home. He is allowed to have one youth passenger in the car without an adult, but I don't know how much I trust young teen drivers. Should we ease up on this rule now that they are dating?

I should make it clear that we trust our daughter a lot. She hasn't given us a reason not to. The young man is polite when he is here. He is coming over tomorrow night to watch the first half of Sunday night football (he is a Cowboys fan and she is an Eagles fan) with us. He is engaged with us when he is here. He doesn't just go up in her room. 

This is our first experience with dating and we are setting the tone for our younger 4 so I want to get this right.",parenting
Mom burn out with toddler,"I am writing this at my wit's end. I am just so tired of being around my son. His voice is so high pitched and he wants everything. He's also very bad at sharing, so I get petty when I attempt to play with him and he says I can't have a certain toy. 

It's not the fact he isn't potty trained, it's not that he gets hungry, or tired, or any of those basic needs. It's that he's always there. And he's so vocal. And he demands attention. And he temper tantrums. 

I've had enough of it for months now and I'm feeling the guilt of it pretty hard. When I get irritated with him, I tell him ""I'm irritated. Can you go cool off in your room for a bit."" And that's been our daily routine several times a day. Him alone in his room for 30 minutes or so while I cope with the burn out and prepare for the next several hours that I don't want to do.

Btw. I'm a stay at home mom. The husband gets home after 7 pm everyday except Sunday. And on Sunday it's unfair to not spend time as a family imo so I just don't really get time to myself.

For his entire life, he's been baby sat about 4 times. And each of those times was date night. So, I just need a day to myself. So bad. 

No. A day won't cut it. I need a vacation. By myself. Just get a hotel room and watch Netflix for a week straight. Honestly. That's all I'm asking for.",parenting
Is a child more likely to be crazy and sort of mean to the parent that primarily cares for them?,"So my wife and I have a two year old. He’s also on the spectrum. So he can be a handful at times. My wife is in school while I run some rental homes and take care of our son at home. So I’m the primary care giver since during the week she isn’t able to really give him a lot of time. She has school work and is in night class so she’s tired. I get it. 

My son is in behavior therapy and it’s working great because he doesn’t understand we have other stuff we have to do. We can’t just be dragged around the house all day bc he wants to leave the room. So I’ve been unable to really clean his room well since he refuses to be in it. Even if it stay and try and clean he destroys all my progress with a tantrum and destroys the room even more. 

I felt a little ill today so my wife was watching him. I felt better so I came up and she was mad I let his room get dirty. I tried to explain why and she basically told me she’s doing it with him in there. And she was. He was being pretty good for her. This basically lead her to say I’m not doing what I need to be doing. 

I have noticed he’s totally different around each of us (if it’s just her or me alone with him). With me he’s way more likely to let loose and flip out on me over stuff. With her he settles down quick and doesn’t really tantrum out a whole lot. Basically just plays with her. It’s frustrating bc she def thinks I can just ignore him in his bedroom and clean and he won’t be a tornado and just break down anything I’ve already cleaned while I’m cleaning something else. 

I’m Jw if the primary care giver gets the most grief basically. She’s making me feel a little crazy about it. Like maybe I’m a shit dad or something. I dunno. However, it feels like I’m trying so hard to keep the house clean and care for our two dogs and son while packing our house to move but I’m never doing enough. 

So yeah I’m just wondering about this. I guess I feel like if it’s true I’ll feel a bit better and not so shitty about it all.

How to navigate a shy 4 year old who is easily overwhelmed in busy social situations?,"(She’s not quite 4 yet but will be in less than 2 weeks). Our daughter has always been easily overwhelmed in busy social situations. The park, fair, zoo, etc. If it’s crowded she gets very upset and shuts down. 

We tried to take her to a “boo at the zoo” event today but it ended badly. She was stoked before we walked in the gates but hated it after seeing all of the other kids there. She refused to play the games, refused to play on the toys. Had a sour look on her face the whole time and would get upset if we talked to her. This happens at any event. We’ve had to leave Easter egg hunts, Christmas Town, and even trick or treating due to her being upset at the crowds, noise, and general commotion. No amount of encouragement will change her mind. 

My husband and I don’t really know how to handle this. We both love to travel and go to fun events like this so it’s been a struggle. We don’t want to force her to socialize but we also don’t want her stuck in the house everyday (something she would gladly do if we allowed it). She is not on the autism spectrum. She’s just introverted and painfully shy. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",parenting
Flying with a Poopy Toddler,"What a wild ride that was. Mom flew home early so I got the 2.5 year old all to myself.

Had a red-eye between Dallas and Seattle. On the way to the back of the plane, my boy has to stop at every row and tell each person that he is wearing shoes. He is happy and content watching spiena man until he falls asleep.

45 mins into the flight he wakes up. Screaming pandemonium. Tried everything: binky, spider man, snacks, cuddling. Stewardesses offering advice. Then it happens, the worst smell I have ever witnessed coming from my kid. ""He proudly proclaims ""DADDY, GOT POOP!!""

I ask the nice lady next to me if we can get out and we squeeze into the tiny bathroom. Half his body is hanging off the newborn size changing table as I clean up the diarrhea.

We settle back into the seat and he immediately starts up screaming again. Not 5 minutes after sitting down, ""DADDY, GOT POOP AGAIN!!!""

Back to the bathroom, past the nice lady, 5 more wipes, ok this is all over finally. Could be worse.

Sit back down, 10 minutes later, you guessed it. ""DADDY, GOT POOOOOP"" People around are noticing now and it's not annoying to them anymore, they are laughing at my plight and the ill-timed bubble gut my son is facing. 

Last trip to the toilet, use up the last diaper and the rest of the wipes. This time it's all up his back and I have to break out the backup shirt. We get back to the seat and he's happy as a lark. Laugh it up, kid. If he only knew how many times I will tell this story at his expense he may not be grinning so much.",parenting
"My 12 yo daughter just told me she is afraid of me, doesn’t love me, doesn’t like me, doesn’t want to talk to me again and wants to live with her mom full time.","Context:  my wife and I are separated and have been for four years.  My wife lives 2 miles away in an apartment and we share custody of the kids 50-50. Together we have three children 17 male, 14 male, 12 female. We have a good relationship and work together to parent the kids the best we can.

My daughter has become more and more isolated as she’s gotten older, hanging out with friends less and less.  In order to encourage her to have friendships outside of school, I ask her to make plans with friends on the weekends that I have her.  And I have told her that I’m encouraging this so that she grows some friendships.

My daughter cried and cried today and said that I yell at her about this (I don’t), and she is afraid that I will punish her because of it (I never would), and she just wants to be by herself (she always wants to be alone), not having anybody tell her when she should hang out with friends. 

I told her that it is my job as a parent to make sure that she is happy and healthy. I told her that I don’t want to force her but I hate seeing her being so isolated. I said that we should compromise.  I told her that I would never bug her again about it if she could promise me that twice a month she would hang out with a friend. I told her I thought that was a good compromise.

Then she dropped the bomb.  

I was stunned. But I think that she is just running away from her problems. I told her that I will always be her dad and that we can’t just throw the relationship away like that by having her move out and live with her mom. I told her that I think we should figure out why she’s afraid of me and I can change, and figure out why she doesn’t like me and work on that. And then have a much better relationship together.

Ugh, what a day.  

The good news is that today’s conversation was probably the most emotion I’ve seen from her all year. It was actually great to hear something from her more than “I don’t know”.

EDIT 1:  she’s already in therapy.  This week’s session will be a doozie.

EDIT 2:  spoken to her mom and she is supportive.  We plan to sit down with our daughter and say that moving in just with her mom is not an option, that she needs to work through her issues with me (and me work with her clearly)

EDIT 3:  I appreciate all the comments.  This is probably the worst Reddit experience I have had so far.  So many of you see the worst in me or project your own issues onto the situation.  The comments were rarely supportive and often unnecessarily mean.  However, I will take all the comments in and consider them before deciding how to proceed.",parenting
Books about diversity?,"We live in a fairly small city. Picking up my toddler from daycare, she was playing with a classmate and said, she had fun all day, they had apples and milk for lunch and her friend, ""\_\_\_\_\_ looks like night time and me like daytime!!"" while pointing at their arms (skin). There is a handful of different ethnicity kids in class, but in her old (younger) class she just moved from,  there was none. I had said, ""Oh, did you play with him lots today?"" She goes, ""Yes!"" The teacher confirmed they've played and stuck together lots. She did tell dad when we got home, ""I play with \_\_\_. He's night time."" ... She's two, but how do I help curb that language or am I overthinking it? Then it got me thinking to get the convo started for other topics.  


We went to the library, and there was just ""Chocolate Me"" and ""Chocolate Milk, Por Favor"" which... seems odd to me? The whole food connotation. Those were the ONLY books that were specifically on diversity when I had asked.

Everybody loves her. We got ten last minute phone calls that they couldn’t make it but would bring her present on Monday. It’s just frustrating. I worked my ass off for this party because she wanted it to be special. 

I guess I’m just venting but it’s disappointing. I know it has nothing to do with us or her because we’re close with everybody and she’s close with all her friends. She’s disappointed but still having fun, I guess. She asked why nobody’s here and I didn’t really know what to say.",parenting
Current preschool is failing miserably - what are my options at this point in the year?,"We enrolled our daughter in a three day a week preschool program. After looking at all the schools (catholic, Montessori, Waldorf, and other private preschools) we choose this school.

The lady that was suppose to be our daughter's teacher quit the week before classes started and they filled the teaching slot with someone who only has one year of experience being an assistant for a kindergarten program. She's basically making the day up as she goes with no sort of curriculum in place.

I won't bore you with the details but this preschool program is a total waste of time, money, and our daughter has brought some concerning things to our attention.

I would love to pull her out of the school but I'm not sure where to get her the necessary social interaction that a school provides her. Most of the good/decent preschools are filled for the school year. We basically home school her now but want to provide her with social interactions.

Any thoughts or suggestions on how to provide the needed social interaction if we were to pull our daughter out of the preschool?

Babies/toddlers with curly hair: what do you do?,"My husband and I have one silly disagreement: styling our mixed daughter's hair.

She's 1yo, and has some beautiful thick curly chestnut blonde-ish curls. They're loose and don't knot much if at all. When I go out with her I make sure they're tidied up but don't bother tying them in pigtails/a top bun unless I have extra time, or it's a special occasion etc. She gets lots of compliments and I think her little loose curls look cute. Think almost Shirley Temple esque.

My husband on the other hand always brushes it almost flat and insists on putting it in a cute little top bun whenever we leave the house. He'll get upset if he sees I left without doing her hair up.

(She doesn't fuss and is entirely agreeable about the whole thing, it just takes some time and finesse. With a 1yo time is not always on my side.)

FWIW my husband is mixed, I am white. She still hasn't darkened up at all and took after my pale complexion a lot. 

So what's your opinion? Is it lazy to let curly baby hair just be curly baby hair? If she were fussy with styling it I'd do it more so she got used to it but she's very good.",parenting
Question about 7 month old and napping,"My LO is 7 months old today and since the 4 month sleep regression has been in a fairly good routine of napping 3 times per day, each for roughly an hour. Nap 1 is roughly 9am, nap 2 around 12pm and nap 3 around 3:30pm. Bedtime is 7:30-8pm. 

However, I’ve noticed lately that the length of his naps is decreasing and he is waking up himself after 30-45 mins. 

I know 7-8 months is around the time babies may drop a nap and was wondering if this is a sign? 

I feel like 3 mini naps actually still suits our daily routine and he seems fairly happy at the moment, but would fewer naps of longer duration be better quality than more frequent short ones? 

If so, which nap am I best off dropping? Or what timings should I go by now?

I thought my son was the naughty one,"Today we went to our first ever party - my son is 2.5yrs and goes to nursery, one of his little classmates was celebrating a birthday so the whole group was invited. 

Prior to this I have had meetings at the nursery where my son has been labelled as a “biter” and boisterous but this isn’t the kind of behaviour I see at home. To the extent where I agreed that at nursery he would be under 1:1 supervision at all times after a meeting. I didn’t really get to explore who he was biting and the detailed situations - I’m not sure nursery are even allowed to tell me the names etc. 

I’m not saying I’ve never seen my son bite, but it’s very rare and something I nipped in the bud at home fairly quickly. He has lots of cousins of mixed ages and friends his own age we spend time with and he’s the charming people pleasing character. He’s bitten before when one of the older ones tried to pick him up and he didn’t like it and wanted to wriggle free for example. He does have lots of energy but he’s not been interested in fighting games at all so far. 

The party was at a soft play centre, I have visited many of these places with my son previously and his behaviour just now was very different - usually he’s very imaginative and holds peoples hands to get up to the slides and as he runs off he peers round corners and waits for his friends etc. He shares all his sweets and crisps and holds hands with everyone etc.  I’ve never seen him interact with this little peer group but there was one boy who was particularly rough. A little bit older and bigger. 

I watched from a distance as they seemed to be enjoying a rough and tumble in a ball pit, however I saw my son pull at his t shirt and so I went and told him off, a sharp “no” from the side lines and he was in tears and came over to me and said “(name of child) naughty” - obviously I’m not in a position to tell someone else’s child off and I hadn’t seen what had happened so I told my son we have “kind hands” and sent him on his way. 


I watched my son constantly run away from this boy who kept diving and jumping on my son, he was chasing him and then looking around to see if anyone as watching before hitting and punching and waiting at the bottom of the slide with his feet up to kick my son. He also had an older brother and they were roughhousing together too. Jumping with knees into each other’s heads and from high up like a wrestling “body slam” 

Now I get the whole “boys will be boys” thing but I have never left my son to fight it out and so I hovered around and had to say no a few more times and was cautious as I saw my son get frustrated and didn’t want him to end up biting - it was concerning to see the other child’s mum sit quite a distance away ignoring the behaviour I am by no means a helicopter parent but the last thing I wanted was for my son to bite at a party.

Now I’m wondering if I should discuss this with nursery. I don’t want my son playing like this at all, I’ve never seen him fight like this with anyone and it was clear it wasn’t a fun game for him, and where he is that little bit younger he isn’t as in control of his emotions and able to communicate what the situation is when he is being told off at nursery.

I’m wondering if at nursery it’s the same kind of thing where this older boy is being physical and my son is being goaded into biting and if this is something I should bring up - it seems a little unfair to have my son labelled as the naughty one after seeing the behaviour of the other kids in this kind of environment. 

It’s made me feel a bit weird, I’ve been reading all sorts about what I could have done to cause the biting and things I could change not thinking that the situation could have been like what I saw today. I’m wondering if I should be pro actively teaching him to defend himself, and working on how he can tell his key worker that the other boy has been naughty etc

Parenting style differences with a sibling,"I have three kids (11, 8, and 7). Younger sister has a 6 month old. I was really looking forward to her becoming a mom, but it is just seeming to drive us apart.   She's been very short and uptight since she announced she was pregnant.

Literally the only thing we have in common is we are both working moms, but I work for financial reasons and she's working because she wants to. I texted her on her first day back at work and I think I made her feel bad because I thought she would be a mess and she wasn't (going back to work with each of my kids was hard for me).

She's always loved my kids, but I know brother in law thinks they are wild hooligans (they are sometimes 😂) and they are really into ""training"" their baby and so far he's pretty easy and compliant.

I've always loved spending time with them, but I find myself dreading our trip together for the holidays.

I was in an accident years ago that resulted in me losing all my teeth. How do I handle my 5 year old wanting play dates and other moms who text me wanting play dates?,"The title says it all. Years ago I was in an accident which resulted in a few of my teeth falling out and some other ones getting loose. I didn’t have the money at the time to get them fixed so the rest of them have deteriorated over the years and now I have hardly any :(. Now that I can afford it I am going to have implant surgery but I am petrified of surgery and the pain of recovery, so I have been putting the surgery off. 

Having no teeth and a messed up face makes it extremely hard going to my daughter’s school events and birthday parties she gets invited to. Not only am I extremely embarrassed but I don’t want this to effect (or is it affect) my daughter in a negative way. I don’t want her friends to turn on her and tease her because her mommy has no teeth. I often ignore the other parents when they ask for play dates and my husband usually takes her to school events and to birthday parties. 

Now that she is 5 it is getting quite hard to ignore other parents. My daughter is so outgoing and the life of the party so she has tons of friends and I feel bad that I’m taking something away from her (play dates and such). There is this one friend she has who she says is her best friend and she has been begging me for the past year to arrange a play date but I just can’t bring myself to do it. Her mom texts me often and I always have an excuse but this weekend my daughter hasn’t stopped talking about going to this place with her best friend, and her mom has been texting me all weekend to ask me to take my daughter. My husband isn’t feeling great so he can’t.

Too proud SAHM won't ask for help. Relationship on the decline.,"My wife is a very proud, stubborn woman. Since a young girl, all she's wanted was to be a mom so she jumped at the chance to stay at home when we had our first (I'm totally fine with it btw, I make enough for us). We now have 2 kids, 4 years &amp; 5 months. I don't work every day but when I do, I work long hours (12-14hours at a time) with quite a bit of travel.

I love my children like nothing else but I'm not SAHD material so the days I'm not working I find it hard to be up to her standards. I still need time to myself but I feel guilty because she is always ""on"". 

Now here's the kicker - my wife will never hire a baby sitter, part time nanny or a mother's helper. I make enough for that to happen and I would be all for it. She refuses, because she's fairly controlling and type A. This has caused so many fights and puts us constantly on edge. I'm not sure where to go from here.

Family time ideas,"My husband and I only had two kids and we did everything together. We were the perfect family: patient with one another, involved with other families, went out to eat or took short little get-aways with the kids. 

Three years ago we got the surprise of our life when we found out we were expecting twins. Fast forward to now. We have two year old identical twins who have a rare form of muscular dystrophy. They cannot completely walk and we do physical therapy 2-3 times per week. They are very cranky/demanding little boys. 

I feel like we never have great family time anymore. Our house is so much more tense. It is extremely hard to go anywhere anymore. We do not go out to eat, travel, or do much of anything, like we used to. 
I am so worried that our two older kids are not thriving like they used to. I love my twins so very much, but miss the days of feeling like a good mother where I could have time for each family member. 
Does anyone have any advice? I think the “go to” advice is to get a sitter and get away with the older two. Maybe that is the best/only advice out there. But it would be wonderful to be able to finally do things as a family unit like the good old days.",parenting
I am so tired of being tired,"Whether they (3 &amp; 5) go to bed at 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 ... they get up between 5:15 and 6. No matter what, no matter the condition. We have done sleep studies and every single book tactic yadda yadda yadda. I have adorable, lovable kids who are absolute shit sleepers. 

What was God’s plan with this? He wanted parents to be overtired and crabby all the time so they can’t be as fun and playful as they normally would be? I just don’t get it. 

I don’t want to keep wishing they were older because I want to live in the present moment and just enjoy who they are because it “all goes so quickly.” 

But I just want sleep. That’s all. It has been 5 long tired years. I just want to sleep. Please God, sleep.

EDIT: I have since napped and am having a much better day. I was just crabby as hell this morning because I conveniently forget that every time we travel they will not sleep in and I need to be with them so they don’t break shit in the Airbnb. You all are helpful and funny and totally get it which is all I was going for. Thanks everyone and thanks for being good parents!",parenting
Is my wife feeding our baby too much?,We have a 1 month old. She might sleep 3-4 hours twice a day. But for the rest of the day she will wake up every hour and does her hunger cry and my wife breastfeeds her. Is my baby being fed too much or is it normal?,parenting
I didn’t do skin to skin. Does my baby still love me?,"I had an elective c-section 2 weeks ago. I had a closed-front hospital gown and a screen on my chest so there wasn’t any space for skin to skin but they did put him against my face for ten minutes. Unfortunately I  had moisturiser on my face so that’s probably all my son tasted &amp; smelled and not my natural scent. Then they took him away for examination, weighing and his vitamin k injection. While I was being stitched up which took around half an hour. Then another hour in recovery where I breastfed him for a while but I was clothed except for my breast. Then we went to the maternity ward and he fell asleep in his bassinet and so did I. It was a cold night so I kept him fully dressed over the next 24 hours. I only did skin to skin for 15 minutes the next day when my midwife suggested it would be helpful for breastfeeding. I feel so guilty as I’ve been reading articles and studies about how important skin to skin contact is for bonding. Especially in the first hour or two after birth. There’s even a Japanese study which said that babies who didn’t have skin to skin contact in the first 24 hours couldn’t tell the difference between their mothers milk and a strangers milk. There are studies which say that mothers who did skin to skin are better mothers and take better care of their babies. Sometimes when my newborn cries, I’m not motivated to respond right away which worries me. I love him more than anything but how do I know that we’ve bonded correctly. And how do I know that he loves me?",parenting
Does anyone else feel envious of the dad and daughter relationship?,"My 2.5 yr old only has eyes for her daddy, mainly because they get to do all the fun things and I’m the boring mum that does the day to day grind... try really hard to play with her when she wants etc but I have a 9 week old baby and now my attention has to be divided. 

It used to be all about me and her and now it’s not she’s become really attached to her dad. It’s lovely but I can’t help but feel sad and a bit jealous when she wants to be with him over me.

I’m probably still feeling hormonal and being stupid but I had to see if anyone else can relate.",parenting
DSS came to my house today.,"I guess I'm looking for support. I (25M) share custody of my 4yo daughter with her (25) mother. We have a week on, week off arrangement set on paper by the courts. This allows us to both be present for our daughter and take her to school, schedule appointments, playdates, birthdays, everything that goes with raising a child.

During my week with our daughter, my ex began calling and texting me, insisting that we meet in person to discuss our daughter's arrangement. We agreed on a time and place, but when I texted her earlier that day to confirm our meeting, she got back to me a whole two hours after the time of our meeting had already passed to tell me she had other business come up. This put me in a pretty bad mood, but I tried to salvage what I could of the day and asked if we could just speak over the phone to discuss whatever she felt the need to discuss.

Some hours later she refused my request and told me that an investigation had been filed regarding our daughter's well-being and that she would prefer to keep her full-time until the investigation was complete. Keep in mind that all of our correspondences on this topic so far have been completely through text, which seems incredibly mechanical and impersonal considering the subject matter is our daughter.

My response was less than warm; I told her she had no right to keep our daughter from me, investigation or no, and that I expected her back at the regular appointed time. The next day DSS called me (I was asleep; I work nights) and then called my wife to set up a time to visit our home. The caseworker was kind enough to tell us that a complaint was filed for our daughter's well-being and that she would check in on us every 2 weeks for the next month and a half. 

The allegations detailed in the complaint are that we physically discipline her, leaving bruises (we've always had a strong aversion to spanking; we hate it. A time-out and a distraction is always our go-to method for discipline), we don't bathe her frequently or at all (we make her shower at least every other day unless she's been playing outside, getting especially dirty) and that we don't take her to school (she goes every day!).

Guys, I'm livid. These allegations against me and my wife are completely out of line. While I know this case is going to get dropped because she doesn't have a leg to stand on, it really irritates us. We have two other children together (4yo and 18mo) that are now going to be affected by this investigation, because my ex decided it's a good time to be petty. It's hard trying to juggle three kids, working and maintaining our sanity. 

Anyone been in the same boat? I'm freaking out.

TL;DR: Ex called DSS on me for false allegations and now all three of my kids and my wife and I get to deal with the 45-day investigation.",parenting
Bright five year old about to get kicked out of school for acting up- help!!,"Our public school kindergartener has been generating notes from the teacher (experienced, but no boys of her own) since the beginning of the year- according to the teacher he has thrown books, lays down and kicks his legs dangerously during lessons, has at most a 3-4 minute attention span except in a few favored lessons. Today, the day after we met with the teacher and principal to try to come up with strategies, the teacher wrote that he was highly disruptive, claimed there were zombies chasing him and tarantulas climbing on him, and, she says, was going around pretending to stab the other children. You can see where this is going- if we get many more of these emails he’s going to be expelled from public school at age five, or if we’re “lucky” be diagnosed with ADHD and we’ll be pressured to medicate him. And this is his second attempt at kindergarten- we moved out of a major city with a rigid system just so he could repeat when he was a little more mature. (He was youngest in his class and couldn’t sit still there either). The end of last year was spent in a small private school in a small class where he seemed to do better.

The thing is, while he can be difficult at home and need a stern talking to, he’s bright and sensitive and independent and thoughtful, and he only really acts up if he’s quite bored. The kind of extreme behavior the teacher describes doesn’t happen apart from an occasional leftover tantrum, and even then he can be talked down, something the teacher can’t apparently manage (granted she shouldn’t have to). It’s true things have been somewhat chaotic in our lives and we haven’t given him as much attention as we did our first. The principal suggested I teach him chess to increase his focus time. I sat down with him and we got through two whole games, no problem! He’s also showing great discipline lately in martial arts classes. I’m very torn- is the public school, even in a good district, boring him to death (like it did me- I ended up drifting in my own fantasy worlds for far longer than I care to admit)? Both parents have advanced degrees, so no doubt he’s bright enough. Is he trying to tell us this place is poison to him? Or should we double down on the punishments until he flies straight? His surly tween sister is not a great role model for respecting authority. 

Should we double down on public school or try to find a private school that can deal with him? What happens when THEY give up on him? I welcome the advice of anyone who has been through this! And thanks for reading!",parenting
Adding a 3rd child,"More of a rant I guess than a question. I'm mid 30s, 2  schoolage children, husband and I both have great jobs. We are financially stable and our children are ...spoiled lol. They participate in sports, we travel, we have fun! 
Husband does NOT want a 3rd child and I can't stop feeling like I'm meant to have a 3rd. I constantly want another, seeing friends with new babies makes me so jealous and just crave the same. 
Major concerns for husband, and I, are history of PPD and depression. I'm on medication that I would likely have to come off. I'd keep my mental health team close, but, I'm not sure what path I would head down after coming off the meds. Also, finances...it would mean less travel. But, couldn't we replace our Disney vacations or 5 star resorts with road trips and camping trips? Has anyone had a 3rd and regretted it? I can't shake this desire 😣",parenting
Anyone else’s toddler creep you out sometimes?,"My 16 month old waves up at the air sometimes, which I don’t think is that unusual since she tells inanimate objects, “Hi!” all the time. 

Today, she was looking down and waving at the floor, and pointing. Then she started barking, and running like she was chasing something. Our dog passed away a couple months ago, so it kind of gave me the creeps, as this was how she would behave with our dog. It was probably just her being weird, but at the same time, who knows!?

Single mom who feels like she’s failing.,"My ex husband and i split custody of our son 50/50. This week has been very trying for me. It’s been a whole year since i left his father. I’m not sure why but it’s causing me a lot of anxiety when i think about it. About where my life was a year ago compared to now. 

So this has been causing me to be a little more on edge and more prone to “snapping” because I’m frustrated. My son asked me this week if i was mad at him because he saw exclaim and shove a door open harder than i should have. He also told me i was making him sad the other morning because i snapped at him for not listening to me. It broke my heart. It hurt me knowing that my son thought i was mad at him. I apologized, although he is only 3 so I’m not sure if he truly understood, and reassured him i wasn’t upset with him. 

It was a good attitude check. But now that it’s Friday and his father has picked him up I’m sitting here feeling guilty. This week was hard, and i didn’t make it any better or easier acting the way i did. It’s hard to not let my anxiety get to me and cause me to get frustrated easily. I feel like i already miss so much with my son since i only see him every other week, and when i have bad weeks like this is makes me feel worse, like I’m ruining the short amount of time we have together. 

I’m sad tonight. I’m feeling incredibly guilty. I miss my son. This has been a hard week.",parenting
Dealing with competitive parents,"I have a 13 month old son and our family friends have a daughter 6 weeks younger. My son hit all milestones very early and has been walking for a few months. We both work and really don’t feel the need to mention everything to our friends, so when we see them, they all oooh and aaah over his achievements. My child is not a genius. He is just very good at physical development. 

These friends of ours are super competitive in every stage of their daughter’s life. This is to the point that they mention every time we see them how many steps she can take, how many teeth she has etc. However, they are now lying. She can barely take 3 steps. I can’t believe that I’m at this point in my life where I have to deal with this. We see them almost every week and ignoring them is not working anymore. I’ve had to deal with competitive parents in the classroom but this is a whole different ballgame. I’ve tried grey rocking them but then they come and sit next to me and just spew lies. 

How has anyone else dealt with this? I’ve said to my boyfriend I’m willing to limit contact if it gets any worse. I currently don’t interact with them and spend most of the time playing with the babies. I’m not competitive and didn’t grow up that way. I don’t want my son to grow up around people who are going to compare him to others his whole life.",parenting
Daughter came home said neighbor girl told her they've been home alone for 6 days...,"I think I'm just venting now..  we live in a rural ..outside city limits area.. 

Neighbor lady has custody of her grandchildren, 13, 12, &amp; 9. 

So when my 10 year old  got off the bus she busted out with neighbor girl said they'd been home alone for 6 days. I know they missed school at least 2 days this week. But the way their driveway is I can't see when anyone is home via a vehicle. 

Then shortly after,  the neighbor behind me said same neighbor girls were begging for food the day before. 

So right after the bus lets them out the 2 girls were running in the yard so I asked them to come over for a chat. When they got here I said ok so where's your nanny? What's going on?

Nanny is in another city doing a bartending gig to make more money to pay the bills. But can't drive home every night because gas is too expensive. Other city is 45 mins away. And the mother who lost her custodial rights was supposed to be taking care of them. 

Then I learn they haven't had running water since Monday. In all this mumbo jumbo from the girls. I had no idea.. I'd already seen the sheriff show up and only honk his horn to no response and leave. (They also have 7 dogs). 

So given the combination of information, I called the county (we live out of City limits) for a welfare check. So they came out and, dfcs was called &amp; the mother who has no rights argued with them for hours and hours and a family friend took them for the night.

Meanwhile I've been texting and calling the neighbor (nanny)..  ""what's going on?""  And no answer no response. And she finally text me today after all was done.. blaming the non-parental right mother. Nanny got a new car and was bartending in another city to make up the money to pay a 2 month late water bill. She blamed the mother of the kids for not being around. I even told her.. I can totally understand if you are having a moment and are just tired of being responsible for these kids that's okay to feel that way, you should look for another family member to take them. But you can not allow these kids to live this way, they've lost their security, they've learned what hunger feels like, they feel unloved, forgotten, left behind.  Please find a new location for them so they can live a healthy and happy life and so can you! 

She text me back with denial denial denial.. I did nothing wrong their mother chose not be their mother. 

I want to fucking scream. I hate this life for these kids.

Parenting advice 11 month old,Hello this is my first child - he is 11 months and I am living in a shelter for abused women in  a foreign country.  I dont know the language so there is a major lack of communication.  No one here really helps me I'm pretty much on my own but I am lately getting a lot of criticism from the other women.  The baby is creeping on his stomach - for a few months now - he's not really up on his knees.  He just started sitting from laying on his own a few weeks ago.  They say he is late to all of this and I'm not exercising him enough.  I dont like to let him crawl around the place too much the other kids are in his face and very obnoxious.  Some try to hit him.  I feel like I am doing the best I can under bad circumstances.  Plus they want to give him sweets and chocolate which I never do.  I also have a roomate who has been good with him and helpful but just today I didn't like how she was acting with him.  She was kind of yelling at him and fighting with him.  It was very strange to me he is only 11 months.  Anyway the criticism of me is really starting to bother me.  Is he late to his movement?  I just feel like what is the rush for these things - even talking like is the timetable so important?  Does it mean he won't ever walk or run? I mean come on I dont understand the pressure - am I wrong?,parenting
Options and resources for parents of kids with non-physical special needs?,"Please let me know if I need to post elsewhere, I'm kinda desperate; FWIW, I'm on mobile.

My (30F) son (6M) is in first grade (USA) and has an IEP in place due to ""Other Disabilities""; in our circumstance it means his mental health issues effect his learning to an extent that its prohibiting him from moving forward in the same way as his peers. 

My issue: Even with the IEP in place, he is still facing suspensions due to physical altercations with other, older kids and also other faculty and staff. I also am unable to find ANY care for him outside of school due to his disability. This means, both me and my partner juggle unscheduled and inexcusable absences with being there for our son. I'm currently on probation at my job and my partner is only making 50% of his potential income because of the requirements of our son. Our son cannot use general education transport (aka, the school bus), so an authorized guardian has to be there every morning at 8 and every afternoon at 3 to get him in and out of the transportation provided by the school system. 

My questions: What do other parents do in these circumstances? How do you manage? What are my options if no other facilities will take him and I cant afford to pay someone my hourly wage to care for him? How does anyone maintain a career that involves 60 hours of work per week and be present for the needs of your kids?  

FWIW: I've searched Care.com, Craigslist, Facebook, local schools and churches, and I'm using what little family support I have. Also, Boys and Girls Club and YMCA are not options. 

Thanks in advance for the advice!",parenting
I really miss it,"Please tell me I'm not alone. I love my daughter (one month) she's my everything. But as my life began revolving around her the moment I found out I was pregnant ( not planned) I couldn't help but feel, I kinda lost my freedom. I always thought I'd never get pregnant, I have PCOS and doctors always told me my chances were slim. My ex fiance and I tried for five years and nothing came of it. We split (part of the reason being I couldn't give him kids) and I slowly began accepting what I thought to be fact.

"I'm just having one of those days, and need to vent and maybe cry.","I'm a mom of 2. I have a 2 going on 3 year old son (Feb) and a 4 month old preemie who is almost 5 months old but 3 months adjusted daughter (May). 

The long back story 

My pregnancy was your normal pregnancy with my 2 year old, the worst part was preeclampsia at the end, and I ended up with an emergency C-section a few days before his due date. 

Since having my 2 year old I've been a SAHM. My husband is a 3rd shift worker so he's gone a lot and most of the time I see him he's sleeping. 

My preemie was born at 35 weeks, due at the end of June. When I was pregnant with her my quad screen came back as an increase for open Neuro tube defect (causes Spina bifida). It resolved itself but started a whole new whirlwind of tests. 

Preemie was thought to have a VSD and then next test they couldn't see it. It went back and forth like this for MONTHS. I also was diagnosed with placenta previa, which started bleeding at 32 weeks, landing me in the hospital until she was born. 

While I was in the hospital they sent in one of the best teams from one of the top children's  hospitals to come and see if she for sure had the VSD and if I needed to be transferred to their hospital upstate. 

They didn't find it and I later had to find out from the NICU nurse she did have it. Husband and I were pissed we had to find out from a nurse and not the doctor. After she was born I kept asking for a repeat echo and no one would do it till the nurse said she heard the VSD and i demanded it. 

After being in the hospital for a month we were finally sent home. 

Now I'm facing a whole new set of struggles, my daughter may need physical therapy, she may need open heart surgery, and I had to fight to get her admitted last week because ED kept misdiagnosing pneumonia, which could have killed my daughter. 

All in this I feel like my two year old gets neglected because I can't give him as much one on one, he needs speech therapy, but because of the constant doctor's appointments for my daughter I can't get him into it just yet. 

I just need a break, a good cry, and definitely some good wine. I don't even have the energy to be intimate with my husband being I'm getting over pneumonia myself. 

If you made it this far, thanks.",parenting
What Age Did You Start Letting Your Toddler Use A Pillow?,"The title says it all, what age did everyone start letting their toddlers use a pillow overnight? I’ve seen not until 18 months, and I’ve heard of parents doing it sooner or right at 1 year old. My little one just turned 1 year old a few days ago, however we’ve been fighting an issue for a while now and that’s her not sleeping in her crib. To further explain, she will fall asleep in her pack and play, stay asleep being picked up and moved, but the moment she hits the crib she’s up. We are thinking it’s something to do with how flat the mattress is in the crib, however we don’t really know how accurate that is. I’d also like to add in here, our little one is a NICU baby, and with that being said she also seems to like being in very small places when sleeping if possible. We thought maybe having a pillow and blanket in there wouldn’t make it so flat and it would also take up some of the run in there then she might actually sleep in her crib but we want to get more parents opinions on if we should wait or what other parents have done.",parenting

I need help/ advice or something.,"I’m a 21 year old male with a 10 month old and is expecting another baby some time next may.

I was the only person that interacted with when he was still in my girlfriend now fiancé womb. I talked to him while she was 8 month pregnant with him, which is the same time her and I got together. When he was born i had this over protective feeling that I would kill or die for him and my fiancé. I didn’t like anyone holding him I got angry that people were holding him for to long or certain people I didn’t want to hold him. I guess dad mode kicked in. Fast forward to him ( Brandon ) getting home. His home environment for not supporting of an infant being their. My fiancé mom and her fiancé were/are toxic long story short I was able to move my new small family out of my fiancé mom house and into an apartment. I felt awesome I was able to provide a safe environment for my son, so I thought. I then had a change in my self not sure what it was. I myself have been through a lot from a young age my mom had a stoke, best friend died, aunt died then uncle, and then my best friend in the entire world my dad. All with in a 6 year span. I was still in high school when my father died. My point is my view on life is different I can be cold hearted a lot I don’t show compassion when I should. I see that now. When it comes to my son I don’t treat him how I think and know I should. I don’t abuse him physically. I just feel like I don’t look at him or show him the love I should be showing him. I let the fact that he’s biologically not mine get in the way and I know it should but I do. I show him tough love I know I shouldn’t he doesn’t understand anything he’s only 10 months but I believe I show him tough love because I was handed a deck of crappy cards, and I’m letting that be apart of my parenting. I’m trying to teach him that the world is cold and you can only count on yourself. I type all this in tears and anger at myself for trying to get him to understand this at his age or to understand any of it at all. I love my son and adore him so much he makes me smile when I don’t want to smile or when I’m mad.. basically I just feel like I’m not ready to be a dad.

My fiancé and I don’t have any alone time, I feel like our relationship is some what sinking. I’m not sure if this is just the struggles of a young new family or if I jumped into something I wasn’t ready for I’m not sure at this point. Any advice or something would help.

Taking infant on an airplane multiple times? Yay or nay?,"Ok so I’m 5 months pregnant, and I intend to talk to her pediatrician when the time comes, but we don’t have one yet.

Assuming there are no issues with the baby or her health, we have 3 weddings this summer. The baby will be 3 months, 4 months, and 5 months old for each wedding. 

Would you take your infant on a plane, that many times, to attend family’s weddings? I’m pretty sure babies don’t have all of their vaccinations until 6 months right? So that’s a lot of people and a lot of germs. BUT if I’m being overly paranoid, we would love to go to the weddings.

"[Co-parenting/Rant] My ex-wife's new boyfriend being touted as ""Daddy"" despite only having been on the scene for less than 6 months.","Okay, so my situation is rather unique (like they all are).

At the end of 2018, my marriage ended of 5 years (together 8) and we have a 3 year old little girl. I've always been an involved and loving father, my daughter is the most important thing to me. 

After we agreed to separate, about 2 weeks later I found accommodation and moved out. I noticed, as I had to return to the house to pick up some remaining bits and bobs, that someone else's car was parked in the garage and that, in my old bedroom, there were items that were unmistakably a mans. I had been regularly seeing my daughter, picking her up from daycare and spending as much time as I could, although I really missed spending those evening times together, I figured it was best to let routines remain for the time being. I'll come back to the new boyfriend in a moment.

To skip over a whole array of issues relating to my requests to have my daughter come and stay with me, before we separated, my then wife, had landed a special fellowship/job at a prestigious institute overseas, due to start in July 2019. As the separation was relatively amicable (as separations go) I had wanted to foster that, for the sake of our daughter and, in good faith, offered that she can still go to this new job. As I am a master's student, we had discussed and agreed on the following points;

* She and her mother (who was helping care for our daughter) would travel to overseas a month early (start of June) and setup in the country where her job is.
* I would work on my master's until all that was left to do is writing and statistics and then make my way over.
* We would financial support ourselves individually
* We would return after a year (that is how long the job was for)
* Once I arrived, we would go 50/50 shared care

Back to the new man. Little did I know, that during this entire period her new man was involved and had been introduced to my daughter etc (they've been a couple for less than 6 months). Without my knowledge, they had travelled and moved overseas together. Now, my master's work got delayed (in large part due to the issues I had with my ex-wife before she left and other things) and I've not been able to leave until now (I arrive at the start of November). During this period, she essentially hid the fact that her new man was there and living with them and additionally, due to my daughter letting slip whilst talking with her over skype, have taught my daughter to call the new man, let's say ""Daddy Allan"". 

This felt like a dagger to the heart. I mean, I know I have no say in who she says or gets into a relationship with, that is her business now. But surely, to keep it hidden that this person, who I have not even met or know anything about, moved in before they left and subsequently moved with them and has been touted as the ""new daddy"" is morally questionable. Also, from my understanding, it is not generally advised to do that type of thing to such a young child, in such a short space of time, fast-track their relationship, at what seems to be almost light speed, and then push the ""father figure"" onto my daughter. Additionally, he has never been a father.

I am now quite distraught in learning about all this just before my going over there. How do I handle this? I fear as thought they have been brain-washing my daughter. 

Sorry to rant, but I'm struggling to deal with this and want to make the most rational and reasonable decisions once I get there. Despite how emotionally charged I currently am. Any advice about how to be a good parent through this would be great!",parenting
"Need some advice, big time!","So I need some big time advice, as I am torn between what to do... Last night I went to dinner with my husband and my son who will be two in a month, as well and my MIL and FIL. My MIL gave my son a teeny tiny not even teaspoon taste of her coffee, which I was ok with because it was so small, and I allow my son to have little tastes of new things. However, she tried to give him more, and I shut that down pretty quick, as caffeine is not at all good for children, and can cause some health issues... She tried to defend herself by saying she gives my nephew, who is only two weeks older than my son, coffee quite often. I told her that was horrible and she shouldn't be doing that, but the conversation ended there. Now here we are into today, and I'm having some strong feelings about needing to tell my SIL about what our MIL is doing.

Here's the kicker though - my SIL &amp; BIL have a HORRIBLE relationship with our MIL... When I say horrible, I mean like one more tiny thing and their relationship could crumble forever... MIL watches their son every Tuesday for them while they work, and they constantly have fights with her about the things she does without consulting them, doesn't tell them where they go through the day, etc... It's been a slew of issues...

I, as a parent, feel like I should tell SIL about MIL giving their son some coffee, as it can be problematic. I tried putting myself in their shoes, and thought to myself that if they knew it was going on, but didn't tell me, I would be furious... if I do tell her, it's going to turn into an all out war between everyone. My husband supports me behind whatever I decide to do, but I need help from outsiders with what I should do...

So Reddit, should I tell SIL what's going on? Or not open my mouth?",parenting
15 month old going thru really bad seperation anxiety. Help 😭.,"Hi guys. 

I have twin 15 month olds. One of them is going thru a really bad seperation anxiety phase. Like full on tantrums and screaming himself sick when I leave the room. His brother is perfectly fine with me going in and out of the room, leaving him with dad or grandma, or leaving him in the crib but his brother is definitely NOT ok with it. 

I'm looking for advice on how to deal with it. All his needs are met when I leave, and I try to reassure him but it's not working. My husband (dad) says I should just let him cry it out but he never stops until I pick him up. I really need to get things done around the house so I can't carry him all day every day, especially since his twin gets  jealous.

I feel like I have had a failure as a parent,"Today I got a call from my son's vice principal. He's 11 and in middle school. Has never been in trouble before, except for missing his homework. She said she was investigating him because a classmate alleged he brought in alcohol and shared it with another student. That child also said they seemed drunk.

After I found my voice, I asked her what drink he had. I know he has a hydroflask but he'd forgotten it at home. I'm wondering how he broke into our liquor cabinet without us knowing. I'm wondering how my sweet boy could do this.

She then tells me it's a bottle of Kombucha. Y'all, I had zero idea Kombucha had trace amounts of alcohol. So I asked if it smelled like alcohol thinking maybe he added liquor to it. She said it smelled strong.  Well, Kombucha is fermented tea and smells of vinegar. So....not sure if she got the smell of alcohol or vinegar. I tell her thanks for letting me know, we will definitely speak to him. She said after she completes her investigation on Monday she'll call me.

I questioned my son the moment we got home. He said the people at his table read the label, where it said it contained trace amounts of alcohol. He was sharing the drink with another girl and she joked around pretending to be drunk. So here we are. He's so upset not knowing what he did wrong. I'm upset bc I would never have bought the drink, much less let him take it to school, if I knew it had alcohol. So now we wait and see what his punishment is. I pressed him making sure he didn't add anything to it, and he swears up and down he hadn't. And I believe him.",parenting

2 month old won’t take bottle,"As it states, my EBF son is 8 weeks and is still refusing a bottle. It’s not a huge issue since my wife is still on maternity leave, but when she goes back and my son will go to my moms house, obviously he needs a bottle and some stored milk. 

I’ve tried different bottles, different milk temps, different environments and he still acts like I’m trying to give him poison when he notices it’s not a real nipple in his mouth. He also refuses a pacifier which is fine, but it just adds to the fact that he REALLY likes the real thing. 

I know there’s options like soft syringes and cup feeding, but a bottle is obviously much easier. 

Just to note, he is my second child, my first child breastfed and bottle fed no issues so I’ve been around the block you could say.

4 year old doesn't understand about gravity,"My just turned 4 year old seems to have a lot more problems than her peers understanding basics about balance and gravity. I signed her up for gymnastics about a year ago because she seemed to be falling a lot more than her similarly aged friends. I mean, we could be standing somewhere and she would just randomly fall? But also, when running with her friends, she would just fall more frequently than them (by a lot.) It does seem a bit better, but I still think she falls more frequently than her friends.

When she's eating cereal her bowl is likely to fall on the floor. If I ask her to take her plate to the sink, she will often hold it sideways and seem surprised that the crumbs or whatever left overs fall out. These aren't tantrums or purposeful at all, she looks rather surprised when these events (repeatedly) occur.

She seems to be doing well in gymnastics - and is a fairly active kid, and loves to jump and climb. She hasn't had any delays that I've noticed and seems pretty advanced verbally - speaking 3 languages fluently - but it's just so strange to me, how often we end up with milk on the floor etc. Is this something I should be more concerned about? Setting up physical therapy or something?",parenting

Potty training help?,"Hi, this is my first post. I'm having issues with potty training my youngest, she's 3. She seems to have no interest in the potty beyond sitting on it and flushing.

My oldest was fine in terms of potty training. He told me when he needed to go and seemed ready by 3, but she just doesn't seem ready. To make matters worse, my DH's family is always asking me if she's made progress with her potty training and when I say she hasn't yet I feel terrible. 

I usually get the response, ""You need to take her on the potty every hour"" or ""you should put underwear on her to help her have to go."" It's frustrating. I know they mean well, but it's stressing me out and driving me crazy. Are girls different from boys when it comes to potty training?

4:30am-back to sleep

7:30am-wake for day

Toddler doesn't seem to like blankets,"Giving some background:

So I have a 2 year old girl and nighttime where we are is starting to get cold and day time is cool to not quite warm. Tonight is supposed to reach a low of 36F, and the high the next day is 66F.

She never liked being swaddled, we stopped after a week, she just struggled until she managed to get her arms free and if she couldn't she cry and scream bloody murder.

She also runs hot like her dad and fleece jammies seem to keep her too warm as the sun rises and her room creeps up to 70-75F. But thinner long sleeve jammies don't always keep her warm enough even with socks and she wakes up in the middle of the night.

Last night I broke our routine and let her pass out before putting her to bed and then put a blanket over her(tends to be a toy otherwise)

I work nights so I was still up until 2am. An hour or two after I put her down she wanted to roll over. Sat up took stock of the blanket,  appeared to attempt rolling over as she was and then just pushed the blanket to the end and then rolled over. Obviously she didn't feel that cold last night.

But she doesn't seem to want them at all unless she's pretending to be one of us sleeping in bed or on the couch and even then only for a few minutes before she violently kicks it away with her feet. She doesn't even like it when she cuddles with me on the couch and I want a blanket. Doesn't matter if she's over or under it, I have to tell her to stop several times before she gives up.",parenting
First time away from baby,"I'm doing it! I've left my 7 month old with my mother at home. I'm off out for the night with my twin sister. I'm very excited as this is my first time away from the baby. I'm also very nervous as this is my first time away from the baby! Why is this so scary?
I'm nowhere near home, I've caught the train to meet my twin sister, so I suppose it's frightening that I can't just pop home if I want to or if she has a horrible time and needs me. She also refuses bottles. Let's just hope with me not there she gets hungry enough that she just HAS to drink from a bottle. My mum is in for a hell of an evening.

Am I wrong?,"Apologies in advance for poor formatting. I'm on my phone.

First, some background - I have 3 stepkids (D10, S8, S4). Their parents share custody so they're with their dad and me on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends and various holidays.

My kids' mom signed up the 2 boys for soccer (community league, not school related). Games for our S8 are on Saturdays. Dad is not opposed to son playing on his weekends unless we make other plans. And that's where we're at now. Their dad and I are taking the kids out of town this weekend to see their grandparents. GP's live 3 hours away. They don't travel as much as they used to, so they don't get to see the kids very often (last time was 5 months ago). They're in decent health, but age is catching up to them. Now Mom's mad because we're not taking son to his soccer game on Saturday.  I tried explaining that he has the rest of his life to play games, but he won't always have his grandparents. I thought she would understand, given that she lost her own father last year and commented often about how hard it was on the kids. Mom says we're teaching son that he can just bail out on his responsibilities and he's just ""following his father's footsteps"". Am I wrong for thinking that soccer, at this age and stage of life, is just not that important? Am I wrong for thinking that family is more important than playing a game? I understand the role sports can play in the overall development of a child. But he's not the next David Beckham or anything. I think Mom is making a mountain out of a molehill.

Stepsons fishtanks are high maintenance,So my 20 yr old stepson has a hobby. He currently has 4 fish tanks in his room. His hobby is adding to my electric and water bill. Currently once a week he has to clean these tanks. He uses a tube thing attached to the sink that creates a siphon. Pretty slick but I am used to a 60 to 70 dollar water bill. It's gone up to 80 recently. We're had to buy special power strips because of all the things needed to be hooked up. He's supposed to be leaving soon but he's considered leaving the tanks here. That's probably not going to last as the last time he was gone we overfed one tank and apparentlu killed one of the fish in the tank. Is this normal for a fish tank to require cleaning that often? I am ok with 1 or 2 tanks but it's out of hand. He's constantly having to create an additional tank because a fish is getting attacked or something. It seems to be very high maintenance and just curious if that is normal and what you would do in this situation.,parenting

SAHP - how do you validate/praise your working spouse?,"Hi all, sorry if the title doesn’t make sense. I’m looking for advice following a conversation with my husband this morning. He works full time, and helps me a ton after work with the toddler (1.5 year old boy), but it seems like he’s missing some validation and praise from me. 

On a typical day, husband does dinner with toddler (I will cook, but I usually take a backseat after caring for toddler all day - I’m 31 weeks pregnant), play with toddler while I relax, and then do bath and bedtime. He also handles all of toddler nighttime wake ups, with rare exceptions. I, of course, appreciate this a ton. 

To the crux of the problem - husband mentions every so often that he is so great as he does so much more than other dads. This rubs me the wrong way, as it seems misguided? A lose/lose comparison? Also, this puts me in a weird place when he says he is a better dad than our friends’ husbands. And overall, I’m not sure where this is coming from.

What would be a better way for me to validate and praise him? Or should I just let this go?

So My Two Year Old Is An Adrenaline Junkie,"No advice needed, or anything, just want to take a moment to talk about my toddler who makes me want to pull my hair out.   


This little bugger. He has recently discovered that he is an adrenaline junkie. Lots of energy, loves putting himself in danger. His latest stunt? Jumping off the side of the couch. Now here's the kicker, he did this once while my husband went to the bathroom and knocked his head a little. All was fine, he was just upset about it. No harm done. We figured he would learn.   


He learned all right. Now before trying to jump from the couch, he first builds himself a little landing pad consisting of one of the pillows from the couch. -\_- I was trying to figure out why my two year old was dragging a pillow across the floor while I made breakfast and then it all clicked into place when he began his ascent to the arm of the couch and proceeded to jump before I could get there to grab him.

3 year old swearing and 5 year old cries all the time.,"This is about my 3 and 5 year old. I’m going through a nasty split with their dad but we have been ordered to do 50/50 custody. 

I can’t do anything about what goes on in dad’s house, but I’m really struggling with my son on my custody time lately. 

3 year old calls me “stupid bitch” “fucking stupid” says “I’ll destroy you” and “I’ll kill you”. This happens anytime I say no or give him shit for anything - like giving a time out when he destroyed his sisters craft she was working on, or a time out for throwing toys at the cats or biting or hitting. I’ve tried having discussions with son about his behaviour and language use but it ends in him screaming fuck on repeat for 20-40 minutes while he’s thrashing around and trying to break toys or put holes in the walls with his head. My sitter quit because she can’t handle his moods and aggression. 

My 5 year old daughter has begun giving me the middle finger, but otherwise she’s pretty well behaved and nice towards me. She says she wishes mommy and daddy were a family again, and cries every day about it before bedtime. She’s started crying over everything, down to colouring outside the lines accidentally while doing crafts. She’s started peeing her pants at home and wakes up every couple hours through the night in tears. 

My kids are struggling. I’m struggling. After paying childcare I bring home $6/ hour which doesn’t pay for a lot. The stress of trying to make ends meet while being there to support my kids in their needs is taking its toll on me. It breaks my heart to see them like this. I don’t know how to handle my youngest anymore. I don’t swear, I don’t give a middle finger to anyone. I can only guess where the kids are picking these things up from. My ex claims the kids don’t behave this way for him, and that it’s obvious I’m a terrible parent so should surrender my custody time so that the kids have stability and I can work full time and get on my feet without paying childcare costs. I feel like my ex is trying to alienate the kids from me, and either himself or who the kids are around on his time are teaching them these horrible things to say to their mother. 

My daughter is upset with me frequently because I won’t call daddy’s girlfriend to set up a play date with her 4 children. I know nothing of this woman other than her first name and the amount of children she has.  My daughter says this woman is her “favourite friend” because of all the presents she gets and the fun expensive activities the kids get to go to when daddy’s with this lady. 

I can’t afford gifts or fun activities. I do free activities and scope the marketplace for free items as gifts I can give. The kids ask me why I don’t make money like daddy does and why I don’t take them to the city and the theme park like daddy does. 

I know things will get better in time and they will adjust to having 2 homes and a now working mom, but for now it’s hard and heartbreaking. My ex has every day off work that he’s on custody time, thanks to his cushy shift work job, while I’m working during all my days with the kids now. I hate losing all this time with my kids so I can afford to keep a roof over their heads, while their dad has moved on happily and isn’t struggling one bit. Life isn’t fucking fair. My kids don’t understand that I have to work now. They don’t understand why mommy and daddy don’t live together. They don’t understand that daddy’s girlfriend isn’t also mommy’s friend. I’m spiralling hard lately and don’t know how to help my kids.

I found a child psychologist to have them assessed, which my ex agreed was a good idea. However now he wants to be the one to find a different psychologist who isn’t biased because he can only imagine the lies I’ve already told this professional about what a bad dad he is. The intake form requires both parents to sign it, and ex won’t. Like come on dude. This is about the kids, not about me telling everyone I come across what an asshat you are. 



TLDR: kids are struggling now that I’m working after being a stay home mom since they were born. I’ve also moved into my own house finally after being separated over a year from their dad but still sharing a house for financial reasons. They are swearing at me, name calling, and got my babysitter to quit with their bad attitudes and aggression. I’m heartbroken seeing how much they are struggling with these big life changes. I don’t know how to help them more than I’m already trying to do.",parenting
Getting people to stop feeding my daughter more information than she needs - HELP!,"I need a little help/insight on the situation I'm currently in. I'm just going to give the basic ideas, but I'm sure it'll end up a wall of text, and for that I apologize in advance. For context, my daughter is 8 years old.

My daughter's stepmom has cancer. It is a very sad situation, but isn't life-threatening as of right now. It's quite difficult at the moment because they can't pinpoint what type it is or what treatment course to take - all they know is that it is some form of lymphoma. 

Well they finally decided to start treatment, but then found out on the day it was supposed to start that stepmom is pregnant. She has had fertility issues for years now, so they worked out a plan to hopefully keep the baby. However, it is very risky and is basically their only chance to conceive because the treatment course they are intending on taking will affect her fertility.

I feel for her and my daughter's father as this is just a crazy hectic, stressful situation. My problem however, is that my daugher knows all of this information. She knows about all of the treatment plan details and the risks involved, the pregnancy and the fact that it's very possible that it won't happen, the genetic issues that the baby may have due to prior radiation exposure, and basically that her stepmom might not come out of this alive. And that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the information that they have shared with her.

When they found out that she was pregnant, they called me, and I specifically asked them not to tell my daughter yet as the pregnancy was only a few weeks along at that point, and they're still not sure of the odds.

A few days later, my daughter's father called and said that they told her ""because she wouldn't chill out with the questions as to why the treatment didn't happen, and needs to know why she has to behave around her stepmom"". They didn't just give basic details either, they told her everything from the issues conceiving to how this is their ""one and only chance"" so if there is a miscarriage, there will be no baby ever.

I think that this is way too much information for an eight year old to take on. She's begun acting up and not listening to anyone, and I firmly believe that it's due to the emotional distress that this information is causing her. The problem is that she lives with them. I don't have any control over the flow of information - obviously, as my request for them to not tell her things was very blatantly ignored.

I don't know how to get through to my daughter's father and stepmom that this is absolutely unacceptable to me, and that they are seriously jeopardizing my daughter's emotional health. Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated.",parenting

I work at home in the evenings and make my own schedule, but I have to make my schedule at least a month in advance so it’s not as flexible as it sounds. Well I just realized that I forgot about my son’s birthday coming up and I already have a full work load for that evening. I know he’s too young to even know what day his birthday is actually on so we will just celebrate the following day, but how could I forget his birthday in the first place!?

Stepchild wants wife to cosign on a vehicle,So my 20 yr old stepchild wants my wife to cosign for a newish truck. He already has the family minivan that runs fine but needs new tires. He doesn't have much saved up and is planning to leave the house soon to rent from a buddy in town.  He is only making 10 per hour in a construction job that he's been doing for over a year. Wife said he should wait until he sees what his expenses are in the rental life first before taking on a regular monthly payment. Highschool diploma only. Told him to pursue a better paying job but he's reluctant. He works so intermittently it's almost like a part time job when viewing it over the whole year. He's pissed that he needs a vehicle. My guess is he's looking in the 10000 and up range. We gave him the family minivan once we bought a new used family suv. His other older brother got the equilivant 1000 to put towards a new/used vehicle. Seems pretty obvious it's a bad idea but my wife is upset that he's upset. I just think he's unrealistic and acting like a spoiled brat. He skipped dinner and locked his room door. Won't even discuss it rationally. What do you think?,parenting
Struggling with medicating my 4 1/2 year old......,"I’m really at my wits end with this, I haven’t had my son (4 1/2 years old) diagnosed yet but I’m 100% sure he is severely ADHD. 

He is up at 6 am (at least) every single day, and he leaps out of bed to start a hellish day. 

He does the typical can’t sit still for more that 60 seconds at a time. 

He’s constantly bad, I mean without exaggeration.... minutes cannot go by without him yelling,breaking something,sprinting around the house,etc. 

Also he talks constantly, asking the same questions over and over even though you are answering him. So much so that you can’t even get a sentence out to other family members. 

His bad behavior seems just to be on a never ending constant loop. 

Doing the same things he gets into trouble for minutes after doing them. 

If you tell/yell at him to stop.... it’s like he with flat out ignores you or is so in his head he doesn’t hear you. 

Every single interaction with him is a battle or argument. 

He’s not a “tablet” kid.... nor does he eat very much sugar. 

So it’s not a matter of needing to expend energy. 

Sleeping is a whole other battle. 

He fights sleep like no other, which only makes it worse. 

He absolutely will not sleep through the night. 

If he’s in his room at night he will like clockwork, wake up and have to come into my room to sleep. 

Which is bad, because he tosses and turns and squirms all night long. 

I really don’t want to have to medicate him, but every day is just constant agony and is having to yell at him or tell him stop stop stop stop. 

Any advise on this??

Are cyclical obsessions normal?,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 
Not sure if cyclical obsession is the right term but it's what comes to mind.  Basically, my almost 4 year old will become totally obsessed with one show/movie/song/artist for about a month's time before either moving on to something else.  

Right now he's super into Nightmare Before Christmas.  This is what he picks to watch for daily screen time every single day.  When he's not watching it, he's requesting to listen to the soundtrack.  When we're not listening to the soundtrack, he's reenacting scenes from the movie or just talking about it in general.  Is going as Jack Skellington for Halloween, obviously. 

He has tons of toys, books, other music options at his disposal but most of his day revolves around NBC in some sort of way.  Before this, it was Into the Spiderverse and before that it was any and all songs by Marshmello.

I guess I'm just wondering if this is ""normal"", whatever that means at this age, and in that same vein, if I should be redirecting him to other things or not letting him watch and listen to it as much.  He does do karate 2x/week, goes to half day preschool 3x/week and plays with our 3.5 yo neighbor kid at least 1x/week so his entire existence isn't ruled by his obsession du jour, only 90% of his free time.  

Thanks in advance.  You'd think by year 4 I'd have this thing figured out but I find myself overthinking everything more now than when he was a baby.  Such is the life of an anxious SAHM I suppose.",parenting
"Twin boys (8) - one is special needs, one isn't. The neurotypical one is now receding/not hitting milestones.","Boy1 has been diagnosed with autism and ADHD, Boy2 has been checked out and has no special needs that have been detected. We, as well as his school, have started to notice he's withdrawing emotionally and not hitting language or reading milestones. His speech is still pretty garbled for a child his age. Twins tend to be a little slower on this anyways, but it's now become worrying. His brother, Boy1, requires so much time and effort, we're worried Boy2 is becoming resentful. He doesn't seem to be acting out (he's not disruptive) just withdrawing. He's also been angrier than usual. We're going to get him assessed again, as well as keep on our nightly reading and writing sessions, but has anybody else been in this boat where one twin requires so much more time and effort and as a result, it begins to affect the other twin?

Just a little rant.,"It's our 11th anniversary and we are going camping without the kids! Such an exciting time as parents.  

Everything will work out as planned if we get to work on time and all the other pieces fall into place. 

Now we are running late for work because the boy (he's almost 2) knows something is up and is being quite uncooperative.  Just as we step out the door my phone rings. It's the teenager and she has had a feminine disaster, I need to go to the school to save the day. Whatever. Such is the life of a parent.

Every other day goes by with minimal hitches. The day we get to escape is the day things spiral out of control, first you're 20 minutes late, next thing you know you need to take an extra 20 minutes and a 15 mile detour.

I'm exaggerating a little, I know. Parenting is hard y'all.

First grade birthday party etiquette?,"My oldest just started first grade and is starting to get birthday invites. I really have no idea how much she hangs out with any particular kid unless she mentions them. Invites just go to all kids in the class.

So we are going to two parties this weekend, and potentially 16 Moore throughout the year because I don't want her to miss out. But I'm clueless about gifts! Do you buy gifts for every party for kids and parents you don't know?

 I hate having an accumulation of junk myself and so far have specifically said no presents on my invites. I figure that's what family is for.

"4,5 yo, extremely sad when going to kindergarden - help","My son has been going to kindergarden every day for the better part of 4 years now (normal in our country). He had no problems whatsoever the first few months, but then he started crying every morning. He is now 4,5 and he still cries or is extremely sad every morning.

I tried determening the problem but he says everything is fine. He has friends. He likes the teachers, he likes the playground and toys, he has fun in kindergarden. But he says he knows he will miss us and that is why he is so sad. Also he is only sad for a short while after the drop off, he isn't sad the whole day. 

He is sometimes also this sad when going on vacation - he knows it's going to be fun and wants to go, but I guess cannot cope with the feeling of sadness when going away.

Can I help him somehow ? I don't want to tell him he can't cry, because I fell it's a positive thing to get the emotions out. I would love to help him cope, though.",parenting
Our cat was run over and killed. Need advice on telling my 3 year old,"Leaving for work yesterday and loading the little one up for school and I found our cat had been killed. Luckily he didn't see her. It was instant for our little kitty but the arse hole never stopped. There is no way they didn't realise what happened. And they also needed to be driving at a ridiculous speed to cause the damage they did. I got help from a neighbour while he was strapped up in the car and after I dropped him off I brought what was left of her to the vet and they looked after it from there.

Me and the wife so far have grieved her loss without him knowing and he hasn't missed her yet as she spent a lot of time outdoors. 

Reading online and honesty seems to be the preferred way to break the news but in all honesty I don't think my little one can take that. He's a softy and personally I think it's too much for him.

Any ideas on how to break the news? The worst part is he'll never get a proper goodbye. If it was old age or an illness we could have approached that properly and had a real goodbye. Now he has to deal with the fact that one day she is here and the next day she is gone.

I know honesty would be best and he needs to learn about loss at some stage but he's just a little too emotional at the moment and he just won't be able to handle the feelings this will bring up. She's been there since he was born and they were very close 😢",parenting
My threenager is something else,"Hey guys new to this sub. Obligatory I’m on mobile. 


So for some backstory I have 2 children. T3 who will be 3 in Nov &amp; P who is 4 month old. T3 &amp; P have different fathers. My ex husband gathered T &amp; we divocred shortly after he was born. T2 (Ex) has a gf and I have my bf. T spends every other week at each house. We split daycare do co-birthdays. No drama all is well. 

So sometimes T is well to put it nicely an asshole. He’s started throwing screaming temper tantrums when he doesn’t get what he wants. He’s downright mean sometimes too. If I tell him to go play he say I “I don’t have to” or if I say let’s go to the potty even when I know he has to pee he says “I don’t want to.” It’s frustrating to say the least. When he’s good he’s great. He loves P but is for sure jealous of her since she sleeps in here with us. He often tells me to put baby down so on and so forth. But in the right mood he’ll give her all the kisses and “big hugs” in the world. I really miss my sweet baby boy who I didn’t have to tell 3038737383 times to stop running in the house or who I didn’t have to put in time out for being mean or telling an adult no. What do I do guys? I love him so much he’s my world but I feel like somewhere along the way we lost our tight bond. Also occasionally he’ll call me by T2’s gf name and it hurts. He knows I’m mommy I hear it all day everyday. Idk why he does that. It’s just difficult. Any advice would be great. Thank you",parenting

Is it gross of me to photoshop a rash off of my daughter’s face?,"I posted this in another sub recently, so some of you may be seeing this again.

I got some professional pictures done of my one year old. At the time, she had a little spot of eczema on her cheek. Nothing too noticeable, but still a rash nonetheless. I didn’t mention it to the photographer because I didn’t think it would even show up in the pictures, or I thought the photographer would edit it out without me asking. Anyway, I got the pictures back and they are gorgeous, except I could see that damn rash plain as day. 

So I easily photoshopped it out. Quick, easy, you can’t even tell I did anything to the picture, except now there’s no rash. However, I keep feeling kind of gross about photoshopping my baby’s face, no matter how little I did. Most photographers seem to smooth out babies skin in their photos, so it shouldn’t be that big of a deal, but I guess I feel bad about it because I did it myself. 

I really didn’t want to go back and ask the photographer to do it, because she is busy with family stuff right now, and we are friends so I don’t want to hurt her feelings or make her think I’m unhappy with the photos. I honestly don’t even think she would notice that I edited out the rash.

5 year old’s legs hurt at night. Could it be something serious?,"5 year old wakes up in tears, moaning and crying because her legs hurt.  Sometimes it’s one leg, sometimes both.  She can pinpoint general area of pain but not exact location.  It has happened about 7-10 times in the past 6 months. 

I had assumed these were growing pains and offered water and soothing.  One day she woke up in morning and said both legs hurt, but then she seemed to forget about it by afternoon (and she was getting over a cold).

Given there are a million plus parents on here... have you has this happen and had it *not* be growing pains but instead something more serious and uncommon? Is there something we should be watching for?

Wife and I have different parenting styles. What do I do?,"Sorry for the long post. Partially venting.

I have two step kids, 10 year old boy and 13 year old girl.  My wife and I have been married for 6 years.  Everything is fine with the marriage, my relationship could be better with the kids, but they don't hate me. I believe I am an inconvenience to them and I will go into that below.

I enjoy being a parent. Teaching kids life skills and lessons. Preparing them for life. Making sure they develop into decent people.  I try to actively schedule things, or watch videos with them that teach these life skills.

My wife on the other hand says they will naturally develop into good people. She thinks most of my ideas are to much trouble, the kids wont participate.  Her view on parenting is, if it is an inconvenience to teach or monitor the kids doing something, she will just do it herself or let whatever happen happen.  I tell her that is lazy.

I am in the military and often gone for a week or month at a time.  Right now I am gone for a year. I also work, she doesn't. So she is in charge of most of this stuff while I am working late nights.

Laundry:

Wife- picks up all laundry and does it for everyone. To much trouble to teach them and they will probably mess it up.

Me- I walk the kids through everything. Pick it up, put it in a basket, take it downstairs, this is how you start the washer, this is how much soap... Of course they hate it

Homework:

Wife: Reads the question to them, and begins to ask them for the answer or what is next, all the kids do is say uhhhhhhhhhhhh and she answers her own question and basically does it for them. All the kids have to do is be in the same room and pretend to listen.  She says it is easier this way.

Me: I make them read the questions. ""Alright, what does question #1 say"" . They dont ask me for help with homework because I require participation.

Sleeping:

Wife: When I am gone the kids always sleep in her bed with her. One time I was gone for a month and my daughter resented me coming home because she had to sleep in her own bed.  I am deployed now so it will be 1 year of the kids sleeping with her. No matter how much I tell her to stop she wont.  It is just easier to let them sleep in her bed, or the sneak in at night.

Me: When I am home, they can sleep on the floor in our room on the weekends.

Chores:

Wife: Kids have no chores. It is to much trouble to make sure they do it right

Me: It is not about it being done right, it is about the practice of doing something. They will eventually get it.

Screen time:

Wife: Unlimited screen time as long as they do homework, shower, and wake up on time.  To much trouble to limit them because they will complain and not go outside.

Me: Limit screen time. Kids will find something else to do and expand their creativity.

Getting to school:

Wife: Wakes them up, gets their clothes out, makes them breakfast of whatever they want, gets them everything, all they have to do is walk (sometimes she will carry the 10 year old down the stairs if he is too tired because he stayed up to late playing video games) They will sit there watching their devices eating whatever she made for them and they will demand juice, a refill, or whatever and she will hop to it.

Me: They need to set alarm, wake themselves up, get ready, I supervise them making breakfast, they watch the clock and get to school. They are old enough to do everything themselves.  The kids know not to ask me for a glass of juice or something.  I will tell them to get it themselves. So they dont even ask, they just get what they need.

She does all this for the kids and them complains when I tell her to stop saying she doesn't have time to supervise them doing it themselves.  I tell her you spend so much time doing it for them that is why you have no time.

I think this dynamic has hurt our kids work ethic.  They know that if they are told to do something, all they have to do is a really bad job and their mom wont ever ask them to do it again.   Or all they have to do is wait for their mom (butler) to come into the room and they dont have to lift a finger.  Oh yea, our daughter left a note on her door saying basically ""mom, can you vacuum my room. PS: Please wash my sheets.  PSS: please clean my hamster cage"" And she did it...

What can I do to help our family? Is this normal? Is my wife ruining our kids?

Edit: Our kids are well behaved on a day to day basis. They do enjoy hikes and activities every once in a while. Other than laziness and no independence, they are fine.",parenting

How to Get Rid of Dry Boogers in a Healthy Toddler?,"My toddler is 2.5 yrs and has dry boogers inside her nostrils forming every 2-3 days.  I used to squirt saline spray in her nose once in a while to melt them down and then suck it out with a NoseFrieda, but now she hates the saline and cries bloody murder - to a point where it becomes traumatizing for the both of us.

She doesn’t know how to pick her nose or know how to blow her nose either.  Again, she is not sick, just normal boogers that gradually form and block her nasal passages.

Steam doesn’t loosen the dry booger’s.  Some have suggested q-tips, but that seems dangerous as the boogers are lodged up her nostrils.  I don’t see how Boogie wipes are effective at all as there is no way to wipe the interior of one’s nose.

How can I make my 20y/o sister more comfortable with my 15mo son?,"For reasons not really relevant to this issue, my 20 year old sister has moved in with me, my husband, and our 15 month son. My sister's a good kid, she helps out around the house a lot without even having to be asked and is always down to lend a hand for whatever. The only issue is she's very uncomfortable around my son. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a situation where I'm trying to accommodate a brat - her and I both want her to bond more with the little one and her feelings are justified. She's 20 and was home schooled (I wasn't, I'm 10 years older and my parents had quite an opinion shift in that time) and has never worked so she's very sheltered, she's never been around kids at all, and she has Asperger's so touch/noise/smell/toddlers in general are kinda tough for her. 

My son's a normal toddler, he's rambunctious and talkative and affectionate. She doesn't like to pick him up or hug or horse around and that's what he wants 90% of the time. And my husband and I have told her (even pleaded with her) she has out blessing to lightly discipline him (remind him to use manners and discourage him from being rude, etc) but the most she'll do is intervene if he's in danger. Like we were outside and he darted for the street so she grabbed him but you can tell she wishes she could just vanish into thin air instead.

This isn't just me wanting to force something between them. My sister has said she wishes she could be a better aunt but doesn't really know how. She doesn't ""get"" kids or know what to do with them. I don't really know how to help them bond but I'd like to.",parenting

15 year old daughter with 1st boyfriend,"So, I'm kind of freaking out.

I picked up my 15 yo from her school's JV football game tonight and she came to the car wearing a player's jersey. I asked her about it and she said it was a boy who she was ""talking"" to.

So, first, I'm super happy that she didn't feel embarrassed to tell me that she has a boyfriend. Second, as much as I hate the idea, I'm not going to be a crazy dad that doesn't allow her to date as I realize it's a part of growing up.

Of course, this is a big event in my life and I'm kind of going crazy about it. And while it is all super new, I want to be proactive for extra caution. 

I told my wife when I got home (just for context, my wife is her stepmom and her biological mother isn't really in her life) and she said that I needed to have the ""talk"" with her sooner rather than later. I told her I wasn't prepared and needed some time to write something up so she just went to her room to do it herself. I guess it all went pretty well.

So, my wife and I both have the same viewpoints on sex. We definitely don't encourage it at that age and my wife let my daughter know that, but we are also realistic and realize that things happen (we were teenagers too - I shudder thinking about what was on my mind at that age). At the end of the day, we just want openness and honesty because we feel that is the best way to raise a kid successfully into adulthood. And of course if something does happen, we want to ensure that she is educated to make smart decisions.

I guess I just want your opinions. Would 15 be too young to be put on birth control? I wouldn't want that to send the message that it is okay to have sex, but I also don't want decisions to turn into life changing accidents.

My wife and I are going to talk about this some more when I am ready.

Appropriate punishment for 2 y/o (3 next month) that threw a toy at the tv and broke it?,"Worst part is I didn’t even see it happen...

I was in the bedroom putting laundry away and came out when my boyfriend got home and noticed the tv broken...very obvious toddler threw something at it because of the way it was broken, like no doubt. I was on my way out the door anyway as my boyfriend got home so the most I could do was tell toddler over and over “we don’t throw toys at the tv, look what you did, you broke it, it’s very expensive and now mommy needs to buy a new one! You’re going to loss your toys for a little while until you learn not to throw them!” Then I had to leave the house and had boyfriend just put all his toys in toddlers bedroom and put a child handle on the outside so he can’t get in. 

Where do I go from here? Does he even understand it? What’s too harsh? What’s not harsh enough? Do I give him all the toys back tomorrow or make him earn them one by one? Only give him extremely small toys for a while? Continue to remind him what he did?

** Need recommendations**,"In June I lost a custody case and my ex wife was able to move my child from Colorado to California on the promise of a better life. I was wondering if anyone knew of any good books or resources that can help me deal with sadness and loss of not having my kiddo in my life. I was a pretty hands on father (for being divorced) and had my kiddo 3 weekends a month. I am now reduced to Skyping with her twice a week, and the next time I see her will be at Christmas.

My 10 year old daughter is overweight and I don’t know what to do without upsetting her,"I have 2 children, both girls. One is 13 one is 10. My 13 year old is very slim. She can eat whatever she wants and not gain weight. My 10 year old has always been bigger than her even though she eats pretty much the same as her sister. We eat healthily majority of the time, fresh fruit, veg, lean meats etc. they have treats occasionally but they eat pretty well most the time. Both girls also go to dance classes a few times a week. 

Even whilst doing this my 10 year old is still overweight. She’s had a blood test and all her bloodwork comes back fine. 

Should I restrict her diet more? Should I cut her portions and make her work out more? 

She’s quite a sensitive child and I don’t want to upset her and I feel unfair cutting her portions and not her sisters. Do I just leave it and hope she slims out as she grows? 

Any advice would be appreciated",parenting
2yr old can't handle change,"So lately I've noticed my 2 year old can not handle any changes at all. 

It's starting to heat up here so he now needs to wear shorts and had a complete meltdown because they weren't his long pants. This morning I took him to daycare and everyone was in the big kids room for the morning and yet again another meltdown because of the change, it's gotten so bad we can't even go to a different supermarket without him having a meltdown cause it's not the usual one he just screams for the other store or to go home. I'm at a loss as what to do obviously I try to keep our schedule as much as possible but some things I can't control and he can not handle it. Am I giving him to much choice? he is absolutely great if we are on routine, or how can I help teach him change is ok and will happen sometimes?

Boyfriend wants a kid (he didn't previously). I'm fixed (have 2 kids from previous marriage),"My long-term boyfriend and I have been very good friends for 17 years.   
We have been a couple for a few years, and from the beginning he knew I was fixed and that was more than ok with him as he didn't want kids ever, and didn't really like them all that much(still doesn't like pretty much any other kids other than mine)  
After doing the dad thing with my two kids I guess his feelings have changed and he made a passing comment a few weeks ago along the lines of ""our kid would be pretty cute"" and when questioning it, he said ""why wouldn't i want to have a kid with the love of my life? a little version of both of us""

I did ask him if he would be okay without having a kid of his own and he said ""Of course I would, I have you for the rest of my life which makes me incredibly happy, a kid is just a bonus""  


i got fixed(tubes removed all together) shortly after my 2nd son was born because I cannot remember to take birth control daily and the IUD (which I'd had twice in the past) wasn't working out this time, and my now ex-husband and I didn't want anymore kids. Ex was/is terrified of needles or anything going near his junk and therefore he wouldn't go, so i did.   


Anyway - my concern now is that my youngest is 5. IVF is expensive (10-15k here in canada) and we no longer have daycare costs because my kids just go to a friends after school until either their dad or I can pick them up, which means my bf and I would have daycare costs as well. and if we do decide to do it, it will likely be in a year, and then 9 months to carry the little critter means a 7 year age gap between the youngest and a 10 year age gap with my oldest.   


i could never deny him a child of his own, and I've thought about how i'd love to see him be a dad himself (yes, i know he's a dad to my kids, but it's different than having a tiny person from the day they are born, and that also calls you dad)  
But fuuuuccckkkkk starting again with a newborn man....

Sleep Training while Room Sharing,"Our baby boy sleeps in his own crib in the same room as my husband and I. Not out of choice but because we simply don't have another room to give him as his own. Baby boy is now 1 year and 2 weeks old and still wakes up 2-3 times a night for feeding. With our first child I did the CIO (cry it out) method. Within 3 days they were sleeping soundly and around 8-10 hours a night. BUT we had a second bedroom for our first so it was a bit easier. They had their own space and it was easier to manage the cries from a separate room. I want to do the same CIO method for baby boy but we are finding it difficult for these reasons: 1) my husband snores and I assume I do also, because husband tells me I do. We think this might be one issues as to why baby boy wakes up.  2) Husband doesn't like the sound of baby crying. He can get easily aggravated from the night cries (because of interrupted sleep EVERY night)  and picks baby up out of their crib and feeds baby a bottle. 3) We live in an apartment and share walls with our neigbors and we are afraid the crying will interrupt the neighbors sleep as well and cause issues for us.  

We have a bedtime routine that we have been doing since we brought baby boy home from hospital. He falls asleep without any trouble, its the night time waking that we are trying to figure out. He drinks 4-6 oz of whole milk before the routine. Dozes off just fine. When baby boy wakes during the night, he will only drink 2-4 oz before dozing off again. I know this also isn't good for his teeth. Should husband and I sleep in the living room while we sleep train our baby boy? Does snoring wake baby boy up?  Please Help!",parenting

My daughter (4 in Dec) doesnt seem to make friends and my mum blames me,"As the title says, my nearly 4yo daughter goes to nursery 3 and s half days a week while I'm at work, while she has struck up bonds I dont believe she has actually made any firm friends and shes told me before she always plays alone, which makes me sad for her. Shes really outgoing and confident and has great bonds with grown ups as well as her cousins but they are all at least 2 years older than her. Shes also bright and seems to be emotionally well rounded for a kid of her age, she gets very upset at people's feelings being hurt. 

She has no trouble striking up a conversation with an unknown adult but with kids she seems to struggle and sometimes it looks to me like she tries too hard, for instance there are a group of girls at nursery and she wanted to take a toy for each of them so they would be her friend. I've explained the Ins and outs of friendship and that it doesnt involve giving (in 3 year old talk) but I'm not sure it's made a difference. Her key worker at nursery has told me she does interact but shes happy doing her own thing and they arent concerned.

I've spoken openly with my mum about this thinking she could give me advice and all she said was it's because shes an only child she doesnt understand how to interact with other kids, which isn't helpful. She has always said she will be lonely, yet she has 7 cousins all under 8 that she sees weekly and loves them a lot.

Today I thought I had failed as a parent,"Number 1 teenage son was left at home whilst I had to work.  We have builders in and I asked him to be on hot drink duty.

Might slip him a £10 note to say thanks!

"Kid needs to nap, won't","We are travelling with our almost 5 year old with a 3 hour time difference. At home, kid's bedtime is 7:30, and he wakes up at 6am. He often falls asleep on the way home from school around 5pm (not more than 15 minutes), and occasionally on the couch on a weekend.

Due to the time difference, he is falling asleep around 6pm and waking up at 5am. We really need to time shift him a little later because we don't want to eat dinner at 4:30, but if we keep him up later he wakes even earlier (eg 3:30) and is cranky as hell by 10am. A nap would help, but he is flat out refusing to close his eyes. If we try to insist, he cries saying he already went to sleep because he closed his eyes for 3 seconds (at this point he is already tired and grumpy).

We are doing theme parks next week...he NEEDS a nap to function. We have limited success with him falling asleep in the car, but we don't want to spend hours sitting in traffic while he may or may not doze. He has never napped in a bed, not even when he was a toddler. He would flat out refuse to lie down or nap unless it was on the couch or on the move.

We have tried explaining to him why we are asking him to nap, he understands and is willing unless he is tired, at which point he apparently becomes possessed with the ""I'm not tired"" demons.",parenting
I think I messed up potty training,"My 3 year old daughter is 85% day trained. No accidents at school or when we're out and about, and most of the day otherwise. She 100% know how to do all the steps and goes a great job, if she has an audience and you're there to cheer her on. If you can't join her or say no, she'll wait for you until it's too late, even though she doesn't need the help at all. She also waits until the last possible second and ends up dribbling in her drawers. I know at school she doesnt need an audience, and when were in public bathrooms she kicks me out for privacy. It's only at home. We  end up with a lot of wet undies.

Here's where I messed up. I told her that for every accident that she has during the day, she would lose one toy. Not a family toy like the trains, but something specifically hers. Well, it's been a couple days now, she's lost 2 toys and it's almost a game.  Like she's a rich toy baron and can pee wherever as long as she pays the fine. It hasn't gotten that bad yet. But it certainly isn't phasing her the way I thought it would. 

I'm worried that if I stop it'll mess up her boundries and she'll see me as a pushover. Maybe I should combine confiscating toys with a potty watch or something? But taking toys away doesn't seem to have any effect on my tiny overlord.

How do you survive having more than one child?,"Hi parents,
I have an almost 11 month old girl.  I hasn’t been the easiest year due to her having minor health issues.  I have worked very hard to get on a good routine, and aside from illness detailing things, it’s been ok.  We have had a few really tough days when I just can’t console her.  I am pretty hard on myself, and i struggle with not being able to soothe her when she’s really upset.  After an hour of trying to console, I’m incredibly frustrated on the inside.  It has tested me more than anything else.  It particularly happens at bedtime.  On those days, I just can’t imagine how it would be possible to have more than one child.  My husband works very variable hours, and is not often home for the bath/bed routine.  
My husband is definitely keen for another but not sure how I would cope.   How do you get to a point of being ready for another kid?  Is a second child really easier than the first?  Are all parents with more than one kid not coping either, but just not talking about it?",parenting
Making reading fun,"My kiddo is finally loving reading! If anyone is looking for ideas, here’s a few that we tried and appear to have been successful (she’s now reading above grade level):
- computer game/video games/app games that required reading instructions in order to proceed 
- special car books - these books ONLY stayed in car. We used Nat Geo fact books or joke books. And if she read aloud, we would play along and respond even if we knew the answer. 
- reading lyrics - we let her pick music on Amazon music, which gives the option of showing lyrics. She’d read them while singing in the car. 
- grocery store lists - checking off the list is way more fun for her than me, but I made her do the work of finding the word. 
- comic books! She has really gotten in SuperHero High and My Little Pony. Trips to the comic book store are great treats. 
- kid magazines - we used Nat Geo and Rick Ranger, since she likes animals. We’ve shared the magazines with other families too, so they get plenty of use. 
- frequent library trips with no shade on her choices - if she picked out a super easy book, no problem. If she picked a giant book that’s way above her level, same deal. 
- no shows/TV/apps during school nights (this was for many other reasons as well) - we would tell her she could read or draw or play, and sometimes she picked reading. 
- holiday books - I bring out books for major holidays, and that’s the only time they’re available, which makes them more special to her. 

Hope that helps! Good luck!",parenting

Should preschool teachers clean your child?,"My mom and sister texted me complaining today that my son always leaves his preschool with boogers or tears on his face. Some days when they pick him up, his pants are damp/wet from accidents. They want me to tell the teachers to do their jobs and clean him up.

In my opinion, that’s not their job though. I’m paying them $300 a month to educate him for three hours a day. That has vastly different expectations than a daycare teacher who would be paid $1200 a month. He goes to school with a change of clothes, and if they see his clothes are dirty, they’ll change him. They don’t catch it every time though. 

Does anyone else’s three year old come home but a crusty nose? Is that just part of being a three year old boy? Am I not being concerned enough? Are they being too concerned? Should we be a somewhere in the middle?

ETA: thank you all for your feedback so far. To clarify: they do have a designated time to take all the kids to potty half way through the morning.

Divorced parents: worth enforcing child support agreement?,"
I'm in a bit of a pickle and could use feedback!

My ex and I split up 3 years ago. We share 50-50 custody. We do not pay spousal support. Our separation agreement has been filed with the court and is a legal contract. He is incorporated as a business owner with a construction company. I am an employee of another company. In past years we have used a 3-year average of our incomes to calculate child support in August of each year (use Canada Federal Child Support Calculator.) This past August his income went down by 40%, according to what he presented. This, in turn, reduced his child support payment to $350 a month. He has refused to follow the rest of the agreement at his discretion(a portion of daycare, specifically.) 

Since then it's been rolling around in my head to question how he is surviving on such a huge pay cut. I suspect he is income-splitting with his live in girlfriend (wife? Don't know if they're married or not.) This is based on the fact that when I was married to him, he did this with me through his company - it's a tax dodge. It's not illegal, but it's through Revenue Canada, which is separate from Justice Canada, who govern child support.

Now, our separation agreement says ""the parties shall exchange sufficient information to determine their guideline incomes... pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines."" I just checked the guidelines here: https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/fact2-fiches2.html and they do say that a parent may need to provide financial statements if s/he is self employed. That means, to me, that my ex husband has to provide financials for his company. The financials will then reflect whether or not he is splitting income. The Federal Child Support Guidelines say that any wages paid to him from his business must be declared. Wages paid to anyone with whom he has an arms-length relationship must not. The live-in girlfriend, if she is collecting a wage, does NOT have an arms-length relationship, and therefore, her income must be declared.

It's possible that he took a hit of $44,000.

It's possible that he is not income splitting. 

In that case, the support payment won't change. But, if he is income splitting and therefore hiding income to calculate a lower child support payment, then he'll have to pay more. This, in turn, is going to piss him off. As it is, he is extremely aggressive towards me, and the new girlfriend absolutely hates me. (I have had roughly 2 conversations with her, and I truly don't know what her problem is, so I just try to steer clear of her completely. I never call their house or him, I never text him, and I email him 1x a week with any details relevant to the kids.) 

Is it worth it to ask him to share full financials, as required by the separation agreement? There will be serious blow back, lots of angry phone calls, badmouthing me to my kids, and in all likelihood, the only way he's going to stick to the agreement is if a judge orders him to (and even then, I doubt he will - he's waived virtually everything in the separation agreement so far, which would mean he's broken a legal binding contract.) He may withhold permission for me to take my kids to visit family, or to leave the country for their surprise Christmas vacation. He may, potentially, just refuse to return them to me. I truly do not trust him, one iota.

Should I suck it up? I can get by with the small amount of child support. My kids and I have a good life. Things are peaceful, for all intents and purposes. On the other hand, this lie of omission is not only breaking the law, but hurts my kids in the long run. What's better? Enforcing the legal agreement that we both signed, or just letting it go? 

PS: Yes, I've spoken to a lawyer, who's advised that if he has nothing to hide, he should have no reason not to release financials - it's the law. I've also spoken to the mediator who helped us write the agreement, and she says the same. Lastly, this agreement includes his signature saying that he acknowledges he understands the agreement, his obligations in it, and that he obtained independent legal advice to approve it all before he signed it.

TLDR; I suspect my ex is hiding income to pay less child support. It's gonna cause drama if I force him to adhere to the agreement and reveal all income. Worth it?

ETA: am reasonably confident that income splitting is happening based on girlfriend's LinkedIn profile. She lists the company as her employer, effective last spring.",parenting
Sharing Holidays?,"Hi lovely parents, I was wondering if you can share your holiday schedules with me, and how you divide them between both sides when you have kids?

We don't have thanksgiving where I am, so we can't do one with one family and Christmas with the other.

That leaves us with figuring out how to split Christmas. Christmas Eve is usually spent working so that really just leaves us with Christmas day and Stephen's day (day after where his family get together and have lunch using the leftovers, my family doesn't celebrate on this day.

We all live in a small town and last year we had left our house at 9am and didn't get home until 9pm all while with a 4 month old.

We exchanged presents at my parent's house, then went and collected his eldest son, followed by exchanging presents at dh's mam's House, where dh and son were going to stay. Myself and the lo stayed there for a couple of hours, then I left dh and son there to enjoy the Christmas dinner and drove back to my parent's house with my lo, this was about 2pm at this stage.
At around half five, I drove to the other side of town, picked him and son up, dropped son off at his girlfriends and then we went back to my parents and stayed there till just after half 8.

Lo is one now and we have no clue how to split the holidays without hurting either family's feelings, but I know I can't do another day like that and with lo's naps it's going to be even more awkward.

Daughter (10) doesn’t want to leave her friend group going in to Jr High,"Next school year, my wife and I want to put our daughter (10) in to the same accelerated school that my son (8) is in. You have to test in, and last year she didn’t make it (even though she made Honors at the school she’s currently at), but when you have one kid in they make exceptions. She is fighting the move, since all of her friends, some she’s known since 1st grade, will all be going to the same Jr High next year and she does not want to be apart from them. Problem is, that school has a  1/10 on greatschools.com, and my sons school has a 10/10, and is by all accounts a much better school. Plus, I could throw a rock from my house and hit it, so it’s convenient. We’re also trying to get my twins (5) in to the school so everyone can be together.

I know she’ll still excel at the school where her friends will be, she’s a great student and her best friend also made Honors, but I know she’d do even better at the accelerated school. I’d hate to break up her friend group, but it’s not like they won’t see each other on weekends and breaks since they’re all good friends that come over to our house, and vice versa. And they have phones and talk all the time. But whenever I bring it up she cries and makes it known that she absolutely does not want to go to the school.

Need Advice for 2 and 4 year old Sharing a Room,"My 2 year old and 4 year old boys share a room.

When the little one was in a crib and went to bed earlier, it worked fine.  We'd put the baby down and he'd usually be asleep before the older one went to bed.  Occasionally we'd need to put them to bed at the same time, but that at most meant a little talking before they fell asleep.

Then the younger one started jumping out of the crib at 2, so we had to switch him over to the toddler bed.  At first, we'd just stagger the bedtimes, so the 2 year old went to bed, put up a little battle, but would eventually settle down and go to sleep before the 4 year old went in the room. Now as the 2 year old is getting older, he's fighting it more and it is getting later and later that he'll go to sleep.  Our 4 year old started to suffer because he wasn't getting enough sleep, so we're trying to get them to go to bed at the same time.  We do the bedtime routine, put them down, deal with an hour or two of them playing/fighting/bugging each other, yelling for us, asking for water,  etc.  They're at least falling asleep by 8:30-9pm, but I keep hoping they'll go to sleep a little earlier because I think they both could use the sleep.

Will the novelty of playing before bed eventually wear off (or at least reduce) if we keep up the routine?  Is there anything we could be doing to help them get to sleep faster?",parenting

Today I stepped in poop and nearly lost my ever loving mind,"Mostly just a rant - give advice if you've got it, console me if you can.  

Today I stepped in poop. Not the first time, wont be the last, but I'm so fucking sick of it. My son is 100% pee potty trained - yes, even night time. He consistently asks to use the potty to pee and will get up in the middle of the night. No accidents in a long time. But poop? He will poop literally anywhere but the toilet.   

Today he pooped in the kitchen hallway while I was trying to nurse his sister. Then he started crying and me, thinking he was hurt, ran to check on him and stepped in a fat hot pile of shit. I was FURIOUS. I yelled (not proud) and quickly sat him on the toilet while tracking hot poop down the hall. My brand new shower rug? Ruined. I'm damn lucky that our new house has hardwood floors or else I'd be ripping up the carpet right now. I'm at my wits end with this. I'm so sick and tired of cleaning poop off of the floor, or out of his underwear, or off of his ass after it's been caked on there. I'm so sick of it. He was perfectly poop potty trained until he had ONE accident and he hasnt pooped on the potty since then.  

I know eventually he'll get it, he wont be pooping his pants in college, blah blah blah. But that doesnt change the fact that I have to deal with this NOW. I want it to end NOW. I'm tired and cranky and I dont want to be checking his underwear and changing him 3+ times a day bc he pooped himself.  

If you made it until the end of my rant, thanks. I'm just very frustrated. Needed to get it out. I know it gets better eventually, but dealing with a poopy toddler and a clingy newborn is tough. This mama needs a day off.",parenting
"I always said I'd never be that parent, but I'm about to become just that","""ADHD. A joke right? Of course kids don't pay attention in school, they don't need medication because of it, right? "" Oh my God, I had no idea how much more there is to it.

My daughter turns 13 in 2ish weeks. She's been seeing a therapist for 6ish months or so. Since I finally realized her odd behavior is not normal preteen  growing up hormonal issues. Her therapist had me bring in a list of all the unusual things she does and whatever she does that I don't like. (I also decided to include a list of all the good/positive things i love that she does, didn't want it to be a complaint only list).

For example; she makes more of an effort to not do any school work or chores, than it would have taken to just do the work. She uses everything in excess. No impulse control. Absolutely refuses to do what she's told. Blah blah blah. ADHD and ODD.

She said she will refer us to a psychiatrist and we'll go from there. I've never been on any type of medication and I'm super nervous. The therapist also said I likely have the ADHD one too which my mom said makes a lot of sense. Mostly the impulse control.

Will she be in a zombie-like state once on meds? I don't want her to think I don't like her for who she is, or think I'm trying to change her. Maybe I should start seeing a therapist as well",parenting

Picky eater or growth spurt?,"Up until recently my lo (16months) would eat everything we gave. Everything. Tried everything. Was always excited about food. But for the last month or so theyve been very uninterested. Eating only a bite or two of whatever we make (even previous favorites) or just refuses to eat.
I'm at my wits end trying to get them to eat enough for survival basically. And when they do eat, we have to hand feed each bite.

My 15 year old daughter is always hateful and unkind to me,"My 15 year old daughter probably well and truly hates me. When she was a little girl, we had a great relationship, and she was a sweet, polite girl who was very respectful to me. However, right around the teenage years, she became a monster. She's disrespectful and rude to our family and our house. She acts entitled. She argues with her siblings over everything. She's irresponsible when it comes to chores and school. For example, if I say hi and ask her how her day went when she comes home from school, she all the sudden starts yelling at me about how I always want to be in her life and that she hates me for it. I try to tell her that of course I want to be in her life because I'm her mom and I want to make sure she isn't getting into trouble. She swears on a regular basis in front of her younger siblings (who are 10 and 5), and she lacks basic manners with me and her dad. If I ask her to do a simple chore like clear the table or bring up school, then she talks about how I am such a terrible person and that she wishes I was dead. At that point I just fall into tears because it is so hurtful to hear my own daughter wish that I didn't exist. When I cry, she just gives a contemptuous snort and doesn't care. My daughter has turned our house into a war zone because of this behavior of hers, and her younger siblings are starting to pick up and copy her disrespectful behavior. I am desperate for advice, I need to fix our family immediately.",parenting
How did you get your child to focus better in a school?,"So as the title states, my son has a hard time with focusing in school and talking with other students. 

When my son (8, 3rd) attended his previous school at a very small PreK-8th, 10 kids in each class, almost private like school and aggressive curriculum. Every year they told us we needed to hold him back because he was “immature”. That he was an August baby. The youngest student in the class, though he kept up and exceeded others. My husband and I never took their advice. 

Well this past summer we moved to the metro area. We moved to an area that has the best public schools in our state, because to be honest we’re ranked towards the bottom in education. My son has about 30 kids in his class, multiple classes in each grade. He gushes to me everyday about how much he loves it, the art/music programs, and all the friends he has made. 

We went to P/T conferences this past week and she had great things to say about him. She said he’s probably her most academically advanced student, very artistic, kind, considerate of others and an outside the box thinker. She loves having him in the classroom. BUT, he just won’t focus when it’s time to and very much so a chatty Kathy. She said he can spout off an answer to the hardest question on a worksheet when she asks directly but when she leaves him to do it on his own he rushes through it or just doesn’t focus on it. She went on to say she has to get his attention during lessons or tell him to get to work on his projects. He had a book report that he got 100% on but had 5% knocked off for talking during others’ presentations. 

It’s just focus things like this and we notice some of it at home with certain duties. We told him that every week we’re going to ask his teacher how he did with focusing and not talking during “no talking” times. If we get a good report he gets to choose a prize- dinner, go someplace, or get something. My husband also suggested we have him do puzzles throughout the week to work on increasing his ability to focus. 

I’m just stumped. So anything else that you have done with your child that has worked?",parenting
Anxious voracious reader now scared of reading,"My 10 yo daughter used to love reading books, including challenging ones.

Now she only wants to read graphic novels, and freaks out about more challenging reading assignments for class.  (She's in 5th grade; this is the USA.)

My observation:  she is mildly obsessive, and (perhaps due to a learning technique at school last year, perhaps due to trying to read a challenging book last summe) she now has to pause at every word she doesn't have complete understanding of, and ask what they mean.  That's reasonable for words that really stump you---though even there it's probably better to just write it down and come back to it later---but she does it also for words that she's mostly but not 100.0% confident about.

Having dealt with my own issues and being pretty familiar with things like cognitive-behavioral therapy, I can outline in my mind a kind of treatment program(\*), but I was wondering if anyone else has encountered this and knows of a formal plan (e.g. a book or web page).

(\*) One difficulty dealing with these issues as a parent is that kids seem to be less willing to be ""treated"" by a parent.  It seems they're more willing to listen to a therapist and also not challenge what the therapist says.",parenting

Struggling new fathers of reddit: don’t lose hope,"Hey everyone.

I’m a long time lurker of this subreddit but I felt I needed to share my recent experience with you in order to give a little bit of hope to every new parent struggling.

Anyway… y wife gave birth almost 7 months ago to a beautiful baby girl. I have been in love with my baby since the first seconds, but it clearly didn’t seem to be reciprocal. She was constantly crying and screaming any time she was in my arms or when I had to take care of her. This caused me a lot of pain, a lot of frustration and insecurities. My wife and I had to seek the help of a psychologist  in order to save our newly founded family, because I was more and more irritated and started to refuse to take care of our daughter : no change, no bath, no feeding, no rocking or singing to her… My wife had to do all the work since I didn’t want to lay a finger (or so to speak) in order to “not make the baby scream”.

Upon the suggestion of the psychiatrist, I started to talk to her when she was in her mother’s arms. I started to play and try to interact a little bit more with her, even if it was just “being there” when her mother was taking care of her. I was expecting a progressive improvement and was frustrated when nothing was coming… until it all clicked together.

Now it’s been a week, and even though I am not yet fully serene when I’m near her and even though my wife still won’t let me alone with her (yet), my baby is smiling and babbling at me, and even tries to make eye contact a soon as she hears me around. This is the best feeling in the world and it clearly compensate for the hard times she made me experience. Now I can finally understand why every experienced parents tell “you only remember the good times”.

If you’re experiencing the same difficulties I had, don’t ever lose hope. Your baby doesn’t hate you, he might just be a little intimidated and it will take hime more time to get used to you compared to his mother.",parenting
"""You could have X,Y,Z... but your MOMMY says no"". Anybody else cringe when family throw out that type of line?","It happens on my side and my husbands side. A family member will just 'divine' that my young child wants tea (he's not even 2 yet). ""Oh, he wants tea mommy, can he have some?"". No, no my child can't have tea (that's filled with 2 cups of sugar and caffeine, just 2 hours before bed). Family to child ""Oh, you want tea, I'm sorry, I would give you some but MOMMY says no"". How can my child even know he wants tea.. when he's never even had it!? You could literally be drinking pig brains and my kid is going to reach for the cup because an adult has something and he's interested in it. Am I supposed to hand over a sip of wine (as if though I ever get to have wine, but you get my point) just because my kid reaches for it with big eyes? 

My in laws have literally said ""oh, you wont let him have ice cream, you are depriving that child of a childhood"". How tha F\*\*K is me trying to avoid obesity (which runs in my husbands family) depriving my child???? 

During my last visit in-law Grandpa would literally pick my toddler up first, THEN grab some cream filled donut and eat it right in his face. Ignore the fact they know I've been struggling with hunger/gestational diabetes and we are there like a whole hour, can't you shove your donut in your face once we leave&gt; But that aside... why literally eat the F\*in donut IN MY CHILD'S FACE????

Son said he feels like I'm a brother and a father,"Thought I would share this here. For the past year or so, I've felt conflicted, and like my relationship with my 6yo son has been almost brotherly in nature. He doesn't have any siblings, and I'm a big kid myself, so I love engaging in games and make believe with him. I don't talk down to him and treat him as an equal, and he shows me respect and is honest and open with me in return. A while back I thought that maybe there was something wrong with this, and I talked to my wife about it. She said that it's a lovely thing to feel, and that this is the relationship she's tried to foster between me and my son, and that even though playing games and giving my attention so much of the time is demanding, it will be worth it and end up with a really close relationship. In her words: ""He won't be this age forever, and he won't want to play with you forever.""

So, roll on last weekend, we were at my MIL's for her birthday and my son had roped me into a ""circus show"" where I would carry him around, dance, open and close the ""stage curtains"" etc. After we were finished, he gave me a big hug and said: ""Daddy, it's weird but I kind of feel like you're my brother *and* my daddy!""

Which is exactly what I'd been feeling! When he said it he had a real look of joy on his face, and so I felt that this *was* indeed a good thing. Maybe I *am* doing my job well after all.

Pinch marks,"This is the second time I’ve noticed a pinch mark near my toddlers butt. The first time I thought she might have fallen down because she gets a lot of bruises on her shins so maybe she fell on her butt or bumped into something. Second time around I ask her if someone did this and she gives me a kids name and says he doesn’t like her. She has mentioned that the same boy hit another girl. How do I address this with the teacher? She doesn’t seem very proactive and I have a feeling she wouldn’t admit to noticing any of it. At most I assume she will say “I’ll look out for it” or something like that. I am pretty sure my daughter would have cried from a pinch mark like that, and the fact that I wasn’t informed of it in the first place upsets me. The other day I passed by during class and a girl was crying and the teacher called from across the room to whoever was causing the problem but nothing else was done about it. I guess I’m happy that she called the boy out. What else do teachers do in those occasions?",parenting
Is my daughter the victim of trauma?,"I know I’m going to be judged by this but that is fine. I want solutions. My daughter is now 3. I’ve been a horrible mom until she was 2. She was extremely needy and I couldn’t handle it. I was also fighting with my husband a lot because he was not helping and had a lot of expectations of me. The house was never clean enough and yet he would never be willing to do anything around the house because he believed the breadwinner shouldn’t have to do any of it. During the first weeks of my daughter’s life my husband would come home from work complaining that the diaper genie was full and that it stunk.
I was so angry with him and we fought on a weekly basis. Lots of screaming. He didn’t want me to go out with the baby like many moms do to relieve stress. I felt stuck much of the time. By the time my daughter was 1 she was always so clingy, and I couldn’t put her down without her crying. Sometimes I would yell at her simply because I couldn’t handle it. When I took her to mommy and me activities she clung to me much more than the other babies. 

I feel horrible, thinking I may have caused her neediness. It was the worst from 1-2. I enrolled her in nursery school to get a break and she would cry at drop off more than anyone else. I worked hard to be a good mom when she wasn’t in school. School was only a couple days a week just 3 hours a day. So I had her most of the time. There wasn’t much to do where we lived but I tried my best to find activities to do and not just watch tv. It was always hard because my husband didn’t believe we needed that many toys even though we had the money to buy them. I realize now that his understanding of childcare was lacking and that I should have fought more to get what my daughter needed. Because we didn’t have much around the house I felt desperate at times, struggling on a daily basis to think of things to do and not go crazy with boredom. But it was really difficult to argue when I wasn’t the breadwinner. I still am not the breadwinner but I have argued enough to get my point across and I am finally in a place where I feel like I am being heard. We have since moved and there is a lot more to do, plenty of parks and activities, and I feel that as a family we are in a much better place.

But my daughter is now 3 and I worry that it’s too late. She is now in school 5 hours a day because I know that is where she will have the most stimulation, but every morning she clings to me. She doesn’t cry like she did last year, but the clinging worries me. The teacher ends up taking her hand to bring her in the class and then she is fine, but no one else’s child seems to do this. Have I effected her to the point that she will always cling to me like this? I spend all my time with her, and I make sure she knows I love her. I hold her as much as I can but it’s never enough. I feel so happy for her at times when she finds someone to play with on the playground and she doesn’t seem to need me so much. But I’m worried she has anxiety because I had severe anxiety as a kid, and so did my father. 

I believe my anxiety was caused by trauma but I don’t know. My father was slightly abusive due to cultural trends(Japanese) but It could also be hereditary. I don’t want my daughter to grow up like me. I have started to mark good days on a calendar with hopes that there will never be a really bad day again. I don’t ever want to yell at my daughter unreasonably. I know sometimes parents just get frustrated but I feel like I slipped up too many times. My daughter is much more manageable now, so I am not worried about becoming too frustrated. I just worry that the damage has been done. Is there any study that can show me that Its not too late and I can correct it?",parenting
Am I overreacting?,"So I didn't cause any drama or anything when it happened but it just keeps playing on my mind and annoying me. 

Basically my LO is 6 months old (getting close to 7) so we've recently started on solids. We were at a get together at a friend's place last weekend, it was a breast cancer fundraiser, so there were some cupcakes decorated on top with lots of icing to be nipples. 

One of my friends was holding LO and we were taking a group photo, lots of people holding the cupcakes up to their boobs. Anyways, after the photo, maybe a minute later, I walked over to my friend holding LO and a second friend had a cupcake shoved in LO's mouth so she was sucking on the icing. As soon as I saw it I pulled my friends hand back to get the cupcake out of her mouth, my friend straight away asked whether she wasn't allowed to have it and I said no, and that she's can't have added sugar and she apologised, it was all over super quickly. 

It just really annoys me. Honestly, I would never feed such a young baby, especially without checking first, they don't know if she has any allergies or what we are allowing her to eat. It feels so trivial typing it all out but I feel better getting it off my chest.",parenting
Terrified New Parent... does the fear ever go away?,"My beautiful daughter was born two weeks ago, and I’m terrified that something awful will happen in her sleep or in her sleep while I sleep.

My older daughter (12) no longer wants to see her father.,"Her father and I divorced two years ago. It was pretty rough on all of us. My oldest daughter, A, missed him a lot when he moved out, and she always counted down the days to see him, always getting very excited when she got to see him. Now, she begs to stay with me on her weekends with him. She has also decided to quit dance; he was one of her dance teachers and that was a chance for her to see him, but she no longer wants to do that.

I’ve asked A why the change of heart about dance, her dad, his girlfriend, everything; she said she just doesn’t want to dance anymore, that it was too hard, but I feel like that doesn’t explain not wanting to even visit her dad, I don’t know what to think, and I’m suspicious at the fact that A is trying to keep S away from their dad as well.

My ex wife is putting too much pressure on my 8yo son’s school performance,"My ex and I have an 8 yo son who we co-parent.

For a while now we’ve noticed him being overly hard on himself when he makes mistakes, negative self talk and perfectionism.

It’s actually gotten to the point where he’s needing to see a child therapist to help with this because it makes him miserable.

To support him outside of those sessions, I work through a growth mindset workbook with him and generally try to help him not take things so seriously. 

I know his mum is supportive of this but I find that she still places too much emphasis on results. 

He scored 80% on a test on things that he’d not yet been taught - but his mum wasn’t happy with that. In “her world” 80% isn’t a score to be proud of.

At his recent parents evening, he got a glowing report but teacher said he needs to work on his handwriting. So rather than let him celebrate with a few mins playing video games, he has to write a ha d written essay on why he should be allowed to play on his Nintendo.

He lives with his mum most of the time and I worry about how I can protect him and best support him. His mum has narcissistic tendencies so it’s not always easy to have a balanced, objective conversation with her.

If you have any ideas on how I can better help him, I’d love to hear.

Update: thank you for the responses, all very helpful. I had a confidential chat with the child therapist this morning about my concerns, but without criticising my ex. The child therapist is going to send an email to me and my ex with suggestions of what to focus on and what to avoid with my son. For example, focus on positive validation and growth mind set.

Baby unable to walk unassisted at 15 months. Time to panic?,"My baby somehow developed a limp in one of her legs with the foot pointing outwards.

As a result she is unable to walk unassisted at 15 months. With hand holding she is able to limp along quite far.. she is also able to cruise with no issue

I hear that 18 month is the limit for walking, but while she is improving, I doubt she will make the cut off. Should I seek early intervention? I m unsure which specialist to go for, my pediatric suggests going for physiotherapy

UPDATE: thanks for all the advice. The reason why we left it until so late is that our pediatric only suggested this at our last visit few days back.

We subsequently went to consult with an obstetrics, and the verdict is no issue with bones and joints, but she has flat foot, with one more severe than the other. So wait and see a few more months if she grows out of it. We can also opt to get corrective shoes or insoles, but general online consensus seem that it is not required..",parenting
Late night sleep issues,"
All the parents working completely odd schedules: how do you help your children cope? 
My daughter is very very attached to my husband, but he works nights 12 hours 5 days a week not getting home until after 1. She’s already asleep for 4 hours or more at this point. The issue is that if I put her to bed at say 8p she will wake up completely inconsolable at 10p almost like she’s having a night terror. This will continue until she finds her daddies pillow and snuggles it to go back to sleep. She is in a weird faze where she doesn’t want me for her comfort   So my trying to cuddle her during this only makes things worse. 
I have tried to let her just sleep on his pillow in her bed but she still wakes up and wants to lay where she would if he was here. I know it’s just a separation anxiety, but I don’t know how to make a 10 month old understand that daddy isn’t gone forever he’s just at work. And I can’t very easily stay up until he gets home as I have to be at work at 8 most mornings. 
I’m not about crying it out either. Especially realizing that it is an anxiety and fear issue to begin with. 

She hasn’t had any trauma to cause any of this or any other issues, and after she finds her spot she is settled the rest of the night. 
I’m just not sure what to do for her anymore.",parenting
Cry It Out - Night Time,"Hi parents. Very new to this sub, but I thought posting here and getting some feedback would be the best strategy. I wanted to ask all of your opinions on whether or not ""crying it out"" is a good method or not.

For a little backstory, I have an 11 month old boy, turning 1 in a couple of weeks. About 2 weeks ago, his grandma was watching him for two nights straight, and she commented how both nights, he got up during the middle of the night (around 2 am), wouldn't go back down until he took a bottle, and then slept until about 6 am, took another, and woke up around 7:30. This sounds like a typical night for us, but she commented that this was atypical, and by this age, he shouldn't have any problem sleeping throughout the night on most nights. I would say typically, he goes to bed around 8 pm every night, and maybe 1 out of every 5 nights will sleep until 7 or 7:30 am. Every other night though, he will get up once or possibly twice, I would make him a bottle and rock him back to sleep, and then put him down again.

So here's my dilemma: my wife thought it would be a good idea to let him cry and wake us up, and then basically turn the volume on the baby monitor on mute, keep an eye on it, and let him basically cry it out. It's what her mom suggested. So we tried that the first night and it basically broke our hearts. I got up and tried to sooth him back to sleep, but I ended up just feeding him and rocking him.

We tried again the next night and basically the same thing, only this time, I didn't get up. I just let him cry for about 45 minutes and afterwards it seemed like it worked. The third night, same thing (only maybe about 30 minutes), and the fourth night, he woke up, was a little fidgety, and went right back to bed.

I'm on the fifth night now, and I feel as though it might've worked, but the more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel.

Anyone else reluctant to scan your grocery receipt for box tops?,"For years my kids' schools have solicited box tops* that had to be cut out and handed in, and although I don't enjoy the busy work we've participated. Now they're moving to a system where their app scans your grocery receipt and I'm kinda wigged out by it. I mean, I suppose I don't care if they know what brand of pickles I buy, but with the seemingly constant erosion of personal privacy these past few years, among with abuses of said privacy that have literally altered the course of international politics, I'm just spent on the idea of giving away anything more. Maybe whether or not I buy organic produce reveals something about my susceptibility to political messages, I dunno. Anyone else feel the same?

*For those unfamiliar with box tops, it's a program run by some major food producers where the flap on their products such as granola bars, cereal, etc have a coupon-like graphic that you cut out and the the school collects, eventually redeeming these with the food company for something like five cents per box top. I figure a large school probably gets a few thousand dollars from programs like this, so if it's worth it to them (given how poorly our schools are funded) then it's worth it to me to snip some cardboard. Scanning my entire grocery receipt, however, feels like an invasion.",parenting
8 yr old perfectionist.,"Any suggestions as to why our 8 yr old becomes difficult or uncooperative when she gets nervous or challenged lately.  We've always encouraged participation, doing her best and having fun over being the best or being perfect so I'm puzzled why she has become so difficult lately.  

The only thing I can think of that might account for her behaviour is that she is in a split class against her wishes and may feel some pressure to excel.  The school principal didn't advise us of the change but made it quite clear to her that she had to go with the older kids because she was the brightest of the 8 yr olds. 

Anybody have any thoughts on this I could ponder?",parenting
I've made a huge mistake (sleep related),"The longer this goes on the more I realize I should have done something different. I cannot get my 3.5 year old asleep by herself. We have a great routine which ends in me laying in her little ass bed singing her lullabies while she lays her head on my chest. But shes not asleep and she doesnt want to let me leave. I've tried just switching to a futon we put next to her bed, and she screams and cries until shes down like 45 minutes later. Even with my arm draped on her. This has been happening for 4 months. I thought I'd move further away each week but it's still a fight to the death to just lay next to her and not under her. Sometimes my husband gets her down instead and it's the same battle plus extra tears for mommy. We have talked to her and she just wants someone to sleep with her. She doesnt want to sleep alone. Then shell try to say shes scared, but shes making that part up and we call her out on it. She is just SO used to sleeping with us. I dont know what to do next. I cant lock her in her room. Talking is not getting through. And the baby steps away from her bed isnt progressing. 

Weekends are easier because she is exhausted, but she gets a nap at daycare, so the fight lasts from 8:30 to 10:30 every night. 

A lovely second battle is at 3 or 4 each morning, she wakes and crawls into bed with us. Every night. I'm very freshly pregnant. This has to stop.

I love my cuddles I do, but I've created a monster and a massive fight every single night.

Is wife's sleep habits bad for the development of the children?,"My wife loves to sleep. She will sleep till 8:30am or 9:30am in the morning on the weekends (the kids are up by 7:00am).  On weekdays, she gets up at the last possible moment and rushes to work, barely seeing the kids.

How to get 5 year old son to do a better job wiping his butt after going poop?,"My youngest is 5 and was potty trained shortly after his second birthday. While none of my boys were difficult to potty train, he took the longest (we started a couple weeks before his 2nd birthday) and probably would still be in diapers if we did not push the issue. He never cared about having a dirty diaper, which we always thought was so strange because he has some mild sensory issues when it comes to other things and generally does not like being dirty. Poop and pee never bothered him though. 

He has had issues wiping for a while now but it is becoming obvious he is not even trying anymore. I am pretty sure he just pulls his pants up, washes his hands, and runs out the door because it is that bad. His underwear is stained and I have made him go change and shower because he smells that awful. I can catch it if we are home but he often comes home to use the bathroom and then runs back out the door to go play at the park so I don't always catch him. I also can't do anything if this happens at school. His school doesn't allow a change of clothes. If a kid has an accident they need to be signed out of school and taken home, so I am not sure what they would do in this case. He never pooped at school last year but there is always a chance of running into aj emergency situation. 

Is there anything we can do to fix this? Much like my middle son this one does not care about punishments or rewards.",parenting

Idiopathic Toe Walking,"My son is 3 years old. Perfectly healthy and tall as heck. 

He has knock knees at the high side of what is considered to be acceptable limits, and his dr wants us to get him out of toe walking and I'm looking for advice. 

Curiosity google searches seem to indicate that toe walking in usually has to do with autism, something with the tendons/calf muscles, or something wrong with the feet. 

He only walks like this in homes of people he is familiar with (our home and grandparents). I SERIOUSLY believe he just does it to be taller/see better/and playfully running around. 

Edit: when he runs inside barefoot, he runs on his feet.

"Exhausted, nap-less 2.5yo","My 2.5 yo son has recently started skipping his afternoon nap. His doctor said that sometimes happens at this age, so there's not much I can do about it, but.... he seems like he needs to nap. And I would really like him to continue doing so.

I'm a SAHM with a nearly 4mo baby in addition to the toddler. I believe the nap skipping is at least partly motivated by his desire to spend more time with me while the baby naps. I'm sympathetic to that, and I do make sure that my toddler and I get as much quality time as we can. Usually, he ""helps"" me cook dinner, and baby always sleeps when we take morning walks/trips to the park/run errands/etc. The three of us also read and play together throughout the day. I'm not sure what else I can do with him without abdicating all other daily responsibilities.

Plus, the toddler is obviously exhausted from not napping. The whole rest of the day, he goes back and forth between being grumpy\* and zoned out. Once, he even fell asleep upright on the couch while I was making dinner. I can't force him to sleep though, nor do I want to waste lots of time in a power struggle...

So what do I do here? Keep trying to initiate naptime? Skip it altogether and just chug along through our day?

Note: Bedtimes and wakeup times are late in our family in order to mesh better with Dad's work schedule, and let us take a family gym trip after dinner most nights. Toddler averages about 10 hours of sleep at night. He had been napping 2 hours until recently. Without the naps, he sometimes sleeps in a bit, but I don't think it's enough to compensate for the missed naps.

TLDR: 2.5 yo is dropping afternoon naps, but seems exhausted without them. New sibling (4mo) may be a factor. Should SAHM allow toddler to drop naps entirely, or just keep trying? Other options?

\*Edit: Grumpy is an understatement. He has numerous tantrums--screams, grunts, throws things, hits, kicks, pushes, etc.--at the slightest provocation when he hasn't napped.",parenting

Toddler only tantrums for me?,"This may be a little long, but stay with me, haha. 
I am searching for some advice from seasoned parents. My 2 year old has hit the ""I do myself"" stage. He wants to do and control EVERYTHING!  He wants to turn on every light switch, do everything regarding himself (clothes, food, etc), everything related to caring for the dog, the cat, etc. I know that this is a normal stage but, as you can imagine, it makes our routines painfully long. There are also some things he can't physically or safely do.
But here is the thing, if you tell him ""No"", he throws an epic tantrum. On the floor, hyperventilating, repeating ""Me do! Me do!"" Over and over (to the point that he can't even hear or process what you say). I stand firm but he continues, and we have been in this lovely stage for a few weeks now.
To make it worse, he only seems to tantrum like this for me (his Mom). He rarely does it to his dad or grandparents. He will do it to his aunt (who he is closest with, oddly enough). The dayhome lady told me today that he has never had a tantrum at dayhome and that I need to look at what I'm doing to cause it because she has ""never had a problem.""  
Has anyone else ever experienced this? Why am I the only lucky one? I honestly don't give into the tantrums so I don't think it is that he is trying to manipulate me. 
I'm just frustrated and feeling like a crappy mom. Any insight? 
Thanks in advance.",parenting
Trouble with 16yo son,"My (41M) son is 16 is stuck in a rut for the last several years.  My wife and I have been struggling to help him succeed in school.  We encourage him to make friends (he has a pretty small group) and join clubs or sports (played football his freshman year, but dropped it the following year).  We always check in daily to make sure he’s going his homework and preparing himself for the day ahead.  His grades this year are dismal. He’s outright failing three classes and in danger of failing a 4th. He’s a really smart kid but has no motivation and I don’t know how to help.  Getting him to do anything is like pulling teeth.  We have spoken with his Pediatrician and have engaged a therapist.  We don’t seem to be making any progress.

I was raised in house of yellers, so I yell and have a shorter and shorter fuse regarding my son’s behavior.  I know I’m not helping and my wife is some what passive.  I feel like I’m rowing a boat with only one oar.

My relationship with my son is not great because of this and I really want to repair it.  My father died at a young age so I’m trying to put the piece together as best I can.

So I feel like daycare only gives me half the store,"Daycare has an app that sends me notifications throughout the day about how the kids are doing.  Naturally it Wi-Fi at work keeps cutting out so I'm not getting any of these notifications. my husband text me in a panic telling me to make sure I ask my daughter about the bruise on her head in front of her teacher. I asked him what he's talking about. Refresh my wifi open the daycare app to discover t that my daughter has woken up from nap with a bruise on her head no further explanation given. Now as a parent I'm like how does one wake up from a nap with a bruise on one's head? something must have caused set reels you don't just wake up with a bruise on your head so I question my daughter when I get to daycare and ask her what happened. she's only in two and a half so interrogating a two-and-a-half-year-old about what happen it's difficult. But she basically says she doesn't know what happened. a follow-up question it's somebody hit you in the head? She then answer that Jenny her teacher hit her in the head? Now that's what's concerning so I bring this up to the director of the daycare who then informs man that before nap time my daughter was washing her hands and began to cry. There was another little girl who was over by her who may or may not have hit her. They both said no but they are 2 and friends for the most part. 

so I get to daycare and I get an incident report that just says woke up from nap with bruise on head! nothing about by  sinck crying unknown cause nothing like don't you think all of that is relevant to the incident? this is not the first time they have left me wondering about what really happened to my daughter.

Just when I'm having fun."" It was... not the typical exchange I have with my kid's friends. On another occasion, we were playing with a small animal.

When is it going to end??,"My ex-husband never ceases to amaze me. Here is some backstory. We were married for 13 years, together for 17. My dad passed away and less than 2 weeks later he asked for a divorce. He wanted me out of the house we had lived in for 7 years and threatened to take our daughter away. He proceeded to send me hateful texts for the next several months and harass me on the phone and in person. I moved out because his aggressive behavior was escalating. He also quit his 6 figure job and started getting food stamps which they tried to come after me to repay. He was also involved in an emotional affair for several months prior to him asking for a divorce.  I filed which made him lose his mind even further. The divorce was finalized and I walked away with nothing. I did, however, get 50/50 custody of my daughter who is my world. Of course after all of this crap, he wanted me back but I just couldn’t do it. 

Flash forward a year and a half. He is now back on his feet with a good job and about $100k in equity in the house we shared. I still pay the bulk of our daughter’s expenses, though he makes more. Last night he tells me he’s moving a 23 year old girl with 2 small children into his house to help care for our daughter. This is a girl he found through Craig’s List a year or so ago to do housework. I know nothing about her or her background and she is going to be living with my daughter and driving her around.

Son stealing food at afterschool care,"My six-year-old has been stealing food left out of backpacks at afterschool care. The supervisor says he's been doing this for weeks. He comes up with crackers, cookies, and other snacks. Sometimes he tells the younger supervisors he has no snack (he does) so they'll share sweets. We don't allow him a lot of junk food, but his lunch always contains something he considers a treat, like crackers and cheese, his favourite fruit bar, fruit in gel, etc. He picks out his snacks at the grocery store so he participates in what he gets. 

I'm at a loss. He isn't stealing food directly from kids or out of their bags. He shrugs and claims he forgets he should not take it. He got in trouble in school in kindergarten for taking snacks that were not his. However, we talked about it and we thought it stopped. 

He doesn't help himself to food at home or around us. There haven't been any serious issues or changes around us. I don't know what to do. This is so upsetting.

Signs of autism?,"So this is going to be a huge wall of text so I'm sorry ahead of time.

My kid is 13 months now. So far he's been fairly advanced. Walking with assistance at 6 months and all by himself at 8. He can figure stuff out like climbing up stairs and those bead maze games..He can play peek-a-boo and makes great eye contact with you, if you cry or yell he's concerned and cuddles you. You can point at something and he'll look in the direction most times.
However, at 13 months he doesn't talk. At all. A couple of times he said Momma but he doesn't associate Momma with me really. He doesn't point at anything. And lately I've noticed he spins in circles, wags his hands will yell randomly. 
I'm starting to think he's showing signs of autism. And I'm totally freaking out. At first I thought all that stuff was just him being a baby, but now I can't help but wonder if it's something more. I work on words and play with him all day but now I feel like a huge failure as his Mom. I obviously will love him no matter what, but I just am so scared of what may be.

Wife and Nanny aren't meshing,"Hey guys need some advice here. My wife and our Nanny aren't getting along so well. The nanny seems to have a bit of a dark personality. Let me explain what's been going on. 

My wife had a few exchanges with the Nanny that have now made her uncomfortable. The Nanny once asked my wife if our son looked at us like he wanted to kill us. Then the next day she told my wife that she should plan to have a second child, because the Nannies friend had only one child and that child died, leaving her childless. This morning our Nanny told my wife that she loves taking care of our son, because she's always wanted a blue eyed baby. 

Although I don't feel like my child is in any danger or is otherwise not being cared for properly...it's just fucking weird and I don't like that the Nanny thinks of Death and my baby in the same synapses. 

With me she's never mentioned anything bizarre like this, but instead her actions seem to not align with how I would expect a nanny to behave. She'll answer her cell phone in the *middle* of our conversations (while holding my baby one handed). She is constantly getting notifications and text messages that she answers. And, when one of us gets home from work, she hands off the baby and pieces out as quickly as possible. 

Overall, I feel like she approaches childcare as if it's *any old job* (such as going to an office, a bank teller, or grocery clerk). She seems to have one eye on the clock at all times. She does not seem to LOVE coming to work and certainly doesn't want to stay for even a moment after we arrive home In general she seems to have one foot out the door when we get home. From her POV I understand the desire to get home, but I assumed nannies as people who have a love for children, whether it's teaching them, or playing with them, etc. 

The pickle now is what to do. Neither my wife or I love her. She does not seem to be a great fit or us, but we're not sure how to approach the situation. I'm reluctant to discuss her weirdness with her out of concern she might get even weirder, and I'm uncomfortable leaving that person unchecked with my child after we basically call her out for being strange. 

Can I fire her for being strange? That seems inappropriate. You wouldn't fire a clerk for being strange. BUT that clerk isn't in control of the most fragile member of your family for 10 unchecked hours a day.",parenting
I can’t for the life of me get my 3 year old twins to go to sleep!!!!,"As the title suggests, my twins are 3 years old and have shared a room since birth. Ever since they hit 3 years old, bedtime has been an absolute nightmare. They negotiate their way out of AND say “NO” to just about everything leading up to bed. 

We start bedtime routine at 6:30 pm. Goal is to have them asleep by 8 pm. At the moment, they are still awake well past 9 pm and it’s cramping on my time that I desperately need to relax with my husband (we have a 2 month old as well.) I dread these 2.5 hours of chaos more than anything and it is absolutely exhausting!!!

Nighttime routine is as follows:
Pick up from daycare- 4:30 pm 
Get home, have dinner- 5-5:30 pm
Play- 5:30-6:30 pm 
Bath, start getting PJ’s on- 6:30-7 pm 
Read books, TRY and calm down in room- 7:30-8
Giggles, creeping behind us while we watch tv, running around upstairs, wanting a peanut butter sandwich, milk, hugs and kisses, to sleep in a different bed, etc etc etc from 8-9+.

I’m losing my mind and desperately need help. We’ve tried putting them in different rooms, but they scream and yell and “can’t sleep alone.” We’ve cut back on day naps from what once was 2 hours to an hour at max. I hate to say it but we’ve given in to all peanut butter sandwich and milk requests in an effort to get them to go to sleep! “Maybe they are hungry and they will sleep better with a full stomach” is my in the moment thoughts...

When grandparents/ babysitters are over, there is NO WAY they will go to bed until “mom and dad get home so we can give them a hug and kiss.” 

We are starting to not want to go out because we know what is in store for us when we get home! Last time, grandma was laying on the floor in their room pretending to sleep to try and get them to fall asleep! She had been doing it for over an hour. Twins were giggling and had so much energy when we got home. Both sets of grandparents are always asking “when are you getting home”... and starting to avoid helping at night if we ever need it. 

I need to get out of the house. I need my twins to sleep.

*trigger warning* My daughter (13) turned her best friend in for cutting and now the whole friend group is mad at her,"This happened a week ago. My daughter’s best friend had been asking multiple students in class if they had scissors. My daughter that it was odd, and wasn’t sure what she planned on using them for, since there wasn’t any sort of project they were working on. Her friend eventually got ahold of a pair and my daughter saw her friend cut herself during class and the blood from it. She went to the guidance counselor and told her. The details are a bit fuzzy here, and I’m not sure of how much time had passed between things, but her friend was pulled from class by the counselor during last period, and at the end of the day we saw the counselor walking her friend to her dad’s car. 

I warned my daughter that her best friend might be mad at her, even though going around and asking for scissors from multiple people the way she did was a cry for help. Her friend can have a bit of a short fuse anyway, and my daughter seemed to understand. What she and I were not expecting was her going into school the next day and her entire friend group giving her the cold shoulder. No one in that group will talk to her unless they absolutely have to at this point. We give one of the other girls a ride home, so I’ve seen it first hand, and those are the most awkward 7 minutes of my day. Needless to say, my kid, who was already depressed, is more depressed than she’s ever been. She’d recently self-harmed only a couple weeks before and is in counseling. Her psychiatrist and I talked it over with her yesterday and, even though I’m incredibly nervous, we’re starting her on a very low dose of an antidepressant. We’ve been debating it for some time, but with the added stress and my daughter feeling like nothing will ever get better, we decided to give it a shot.

To complicate matters further, her best friend’s mom is my best friend. Knowing her the way I do, I’ve given her a bit of space, because I know that’s what she needs when she’s overwhelmed. I did reach out to her on Friday, but only got a few words as a response. I understand that she’s also in pain, but I miss my best friend. I’m glad she has other people that she can turn to still (based off FB posts), and I feel selfish for saying it, but I’m not sure why my daughter doing something that could help her daughter is making her shut me out. I don’t expect gratitude, because my daughter was doing what any decent person would, but I’m still a bit surprised that I’m being treated like the bad guy. It makes it harder to be optimistic about where my daughter’s relationship with her friends are headed, when I talk to her, when I don’t even have my best friend around. 

Am I very proud to say, even with everyone being mad at her, my daughter said she’d still turn her friend in, because her friend’s safety matters more than that.",parenting
Easily offended 4 year old,"Lately, my 4 year old is finding offense in seemingly random situations, much like a toddler. ""You cut my sandwich the *wrong way*! "" (He wasn't this way as a toddler, FWIW.)

We will be interacting quite happily, but then I will do something ""wrong"" that offends him. ""You need to apologize!!!"" he'll scream. He remains huffy for 5-10 minutes afterwards.

These incidents come out of nowhere, almost at random, and don't seem to be related to being hungry, tired, etc. Fortunately, this problem seems to be confined to immediate family. He gets glowing reports from his teachers.

I wonder if he's mimicing something from school, or even if Daniel Tiger's apology episode is playing a part in his behavior. Not sure of the ep. title/number but it's where the kids learn you should apologize even when there problem stems from an accident instead of an intentional act.

**So, two questions:**

1. Why is this happening? Is this a phase?

2. How do we get him to understand when an apology is needed and when it's not needed?",parenting
Preschool wants to put my son (3) with the 2's class,"I almost just need to rant because I'm getting emotional about this. Thanks in advance for any help!

I have a preschool that I love and want to put my son in but I'm having a problem with the class they want to put him in. He turned 3 a week after their cut off so now they want to put him in the 2's class until next September.

I looked at some of the stuff the 3s class is doing and it's stuff my son is good at. He can do basic math and site read a lot of words and he's learning to write.

How to help my 7yr old son who is overweight?,"He is borderline overweight. He hates sports and hates veggies. Unfortunately he also eats all day. His brother is special needs with epilepsy and I comfort eat as well..... my health sucks because of my weight. I don't know what to do. A kids fitbit? Not allowing seconds? I sincerely dont know what to do  


Edit: He went from 50% weight to 80%.... his height is 90% and is 7.5 years old. It isn't a concern but that big of jump is and if he continues to gain that way he will become overweight. I do keep apples and carrots and cheese sticks as well as eggs always on hand for quick snacks but he tends to ""binge"" like just going back and back and back for more. We do not drink juice or milk just water. I have a binge disorder i do after the kids are in bed and i am trying to stop so seeing these signs in my child is concerning. We do have a sibling with special needs so he snacks usually after school when we are doing things with his brother.",parenting

It is not nice to flip over your brother...,"I have a 2yo boy and a 3mo boy. Yesterday, for really no reason at all, my toddler decided to flip his brother over while he was sitting in the baby boincy seat (no injury, carpet floor, just scared). Hubby immediately picked up baby to console him while very loudly yelling at toddler - ""What did you do?!"" ""Git!"" ""Little sh*t!""  Toddler instantly cries, baby cries louder, toddler cries louder, spiral of madness. I manage to calm toddler down with the intent of explaining that he cannot do what he just did, but hubby interpreted that as saying it was OK to flip his brother over. 

Parental argument ensues... 

As a result of this situation, hubby and I are seeking methods to communicate to toddler when bad things happen. Generally, toddler either doesn't acknowledge babys existance, will randomly point at and kiss him, or decide babys rattle is his.

PLEASE HELP out of control child,"My boyfriend's son has behaviour problems. He has been seen by doctors and has the official diagnosis of Oppositional Defiance Disorder. Currently he is 11 and has not been placed on medication as per the doctor. He's been in 5 schools during his 5 grades completed because the schools no longer accept him by he end of the year. He is constantly fighting, swearing, screaming, being belligerent to all staff and parents at the school, running away from school and threatening to jump off very high areas inside the school. Nothing at all is beimg done about it, besides calling his parents and trying to get them to talk him down. That hasn't been working as of late, he won't even listen to his parents now. They have been split up his whole life and he hasn't known anything except the chaotic life he's had. They have 50/50 custody, but the kid wouldn't stop running away from my house because I held him accountable with no video games or tv on bad days (which was every single day). The kid chose to be away from our house for 10 months. I'm the asshole and will admit I was happy during those 10 months of not having to deal with him. Now he's back and worse than before. He is in my opinion, completely out of control. We found out his mum was removing him from school when they called and now she's tired of having to take him home every day so she's making him stay. The school is not equipped to deal with him, because of student rights they have to let him act like a total jackass and disrupt everyone else's learning. This situation is causing a huge rift in our little family and I don't know what to do. I took myself out of the situation because I was told I was part of the problem. I am no longer responsible for helping out and looking after him as I also can't get him to listen. Because it keeps getting worse that's all I can see, even worse yet for the future. Does anyone have anything to say about this, any experience or advice would be very welcome. Please remember I'm on the outside of this, and I would sincerely like this to work out decently for all parties involved. I just don't even know thow to begin thinking about it effectively.

How to get 3.5 yo to stay in bed all night,"Title says it all. She used to be a great sleeper. We transitioned her to a real bed early summer. Everything was great until September. She started hauling a terrible time going to sleep and would become clingy and make us stay until she was in a deep sleep and we could sneak out. But then she would also wake at 12, 1, 2 sometime in the middle of the night and come into our room either crying or just making my wife come back to bed with her. This is still happening 

Going to sleep routine is better now. We also have started trying some melatonin gummies which really make her groggy. She falls asleep fast and hard. However she is still waking in the middle of the night and not staying in her room. 

We have tried a sleep fairy story with letters and toys left outside her door for staying asleep all night. We’ve tried sticker charts with rewards.  She’s excited when it works out, and disappointed when it doesn’t, but it still hasn’t really resolved the behavior. 

Any ideas or suggestions?",parenting
What are the pros/cons of living with parents while raising a new baby?,"My husband and I are expecting our first baby in February and my parents have offered to let us rent their guest house for $1200/mo less than we are paying now. They own 100+ acres so we wouldn't be right next to each other, we'd have plenty of room for our animals (horses, dogs and chickens), and it would give us the opportunity to save and buy our own little ranch in 3-4 years. I'm sure my mom would help with our new baby while I work from home or we go for the occasional date. It sounds like a great solution, but they live in a REALLY remote area and it's an area my husband and I really don't like. It's in the desert and extremely isolated. I'm talking 40 minutes to the nearest town and my parents are known for being pushy and not respecting boundaries. 

I'm not sure we would be able to afford to save for a down payment in any other situation, but I'm worried the closeness paired with isolation from our friends and social lives will create a lot of tension in our family. Has anyone been in a similar situation and if so, was it worth it? I'm hoping when the baby comes, our lives will change so much anyway that the isolation won't be as palpable. Keep in mind we are 35 and 38 so it's not like we are in our early 20s and hoping to party or anything. We just like trips to the park or beach and getting out of the house now and then.",parenting
What would throw off my toddler's vagina pH?,"Odd question, I know. I googled it and I called the pediatrician. The pediatrician is who told me her pH might be off and Google doesn't say what would make a *toddler's* pH go wrong.

I just changed her diaper and I wiped her. On the wipe was a smear of pea green... something. Urine, I guess, since toddlers dont have discharge, right?

So naturally I sniff it because there wasn't any stool in the diaper and it had a very strong vagina smell. I've never dealt with this with my daughters and have seldom experienced it myself.

My 2 &amp; 4 year olds own us,"My kids don’t listen. At all. To me or to my partner. They won’t eat, they won’t go to sleep, they won’t play when it’s play time and they’ve been begging to play.  We don’t ask them to do any ridiculous things. It’s literally getting them to cooperate with taking care of themselves that they fight. 

We are at a loss for what to do to get them to listen. Time outs sometimes work but usually not.  The kids are motivated by nothing as far as we can figure out.  We don’t spank.

Productive Parents?,"This question is for those parents that don't blindly scroll FB or Reddit all day in a mild depression... What do you do?? 

I have a 3 year old that is basically wrangled in the living room because she is CRAZY and rearranges the kitchen/dining room, goes through drawers in bedrooms (doors are now all locked) etc... And I just basically am overhelmed with a high risk pregnancy. I quit smoking weed and find I am just replacing weed with internet addiction I think. I can't get out and push her in a stroller because I'm now 33 weeks pregnant with a cervical stitch. Not that the drs told me I can't but my pelvis just hurts too much. I do have SPD. I can't take her to the park because she kicks and screams when it's time to leave it's just better to avoid. Dad is currently away at school until the end of the month. I'd like to try getting into a more positive mental routine. 

I've given up on cleaning the living room, I've set it up like a daycare. Safe, kids stuff only, an wisely and crayons for drawing, a kitchen and food to play with. I can't sit on the floor but I get her to make me food and pretend it's the most delicious shit I've ever eaten. She loves that. There are toys everywhere all the time. It's a little depressing but I've given up worrying about keeping it tidy I'd rather her have at least one place to be a kid. 

I keep the rest of the house relatively tidy. Dishes are done and laundry is done and out away. I'm bored. Sooooo bored. I have trouble concentrating. Meditating just doesn't happen right now even though I've consistently tried. 

Maybe if someone could give me an idea of their schedule? I'm tired of having the tv on all the time for her (although Daniel tiger has taught her some great stuff lol) and just zoning out all day. 

I was a content SAHM when I loved TV. Now I find movies and TV pointless and a waste.  I find I'm turning away from social media, I don't buy into it anymore and only have 40 friends on my Facebook now, no snapchat or any other social media. Reading is a no go I find I need focus to actually retain what I'm reading and that just doesn't happen with a 3 year old around. 

I'm worried I'm going to become super depressed when baby girl gets here as I have no way of making the days feel productive and happy. I'm telling a lot at my oldest because his behaviour has been less than stellar. Lots of lying to my face, disrespectful behaviours like peeing on the toilet seat and leaving it. Being mean to his sis. I've talked about it and he just plays dumb. So I'm starting more of an Authoritative Parenting Style. I was more the passive parent for the sake of peace but it got me nowhere and now I'm having to be extra harsh to make up for the year or so of being too permissive. (Hubby and i have been together for 14 months at this point, married 4 months ago). 

I grew up with parents that bought me every electronic device under the sun to keep me quiet and ignore me (only child) and they spoiled me which didn't set me up for success. I didn't get my shit together until I was 28 (31 now). We don't have tablets or phones for the kids. I don't like them staring at a screen 6 inches from their face. I figure at least with the tv they can walk around and so other activities while it plays (which they do).

I'm (M28) a new dad and I feel useless because I can't feed my daughter,"Hopefully I can put this into a concise thought.  I may mess up some information, but I'm going to do my best to get the timeline and information correct. I'm running on barely any sleep.  Apologies for the long post in advance. 

My daughter was born on 10/2 via a C-Section at 37 weeks. She weighed 5 lbs 12 oz at birth. She is beautiful and I loved her from the moment she came out of my wife. 

My wife wanted to solely breast feed so she started trying and working with lactation at the hospital to get my daughter to feed properly.  My wife noticed some issues with her mouth and tongue due to her profession and brought it up to lactation but they more or less dismissed it. So she continued...

Until we ended up back in the hospital with her because we noticed that her lips would turn blue when we would bottle feed her formula (we had to supplement some formula while the breast milk came in). It was just her lips, not her entire face or body. 

By the end of our stay, she had gone under anesthesia, had a CT scan, EKG, and an Echo Cardiogram (cardiograph?). They found 3 incidental findings; two in her heart and one in her brain. The one in the brain thankfully ended up being nothing, but the two in her heart ended up being *something*. The cardiologist told us he wasn't concerned and was fairly confident that one of them was causing her blue episodes, probably combined with reflux (which we were told she probably has as well). 

Combined with all of that, she had lost 9% of her birth weight, which is not great. Newborns are allowed to lose up to 10% (probably depending on your healthcare specialist) but since she was already so small, this was extremely concerning. My wife did some tests and pumping to determine that my daughter had only been getting about 0.5 oz at the breast. We were advised to go solely to bottle feeding and pumping the milk to give it to her. 

So we left the hospital with the conclusion that her reflux combined with this one heart issue was causing her blue episodes. They gave us some tips to help with the reflux and hopefully keep her from turning blue which we've been following, plus the feeding plan. 

So fast forward to today. We've now gone to see speech therapy and are going to continue to see them. They've given us more tips on how to feed her to make sure she gets enough food in enough time and I've tried to feed her 3 times now and have fucked up every single one. We've been giving her 55 ml of pumped breast milk in a bottle with the idea to Pace her at 4-5 sucks before tilting the bottle away. No matter what I do or try, I just can't seem to get it down and she ends up not getting the full 55 in the allotted 30 minutes. My wife is pissed at me because I keep trying to feed her which ends up being at my daughter's expense and I'm feeling utterly useless.  Feeding at the bottle was something I really wanted to do with her to help out my wife but I can't even do that right. 

I'm still doing a lot around the house and with her like changing, holding, but that doesn't feel like a lot. We don't know if my wife is going to be able to breast feed and I know that feeding is going to be a huge part of bonding with her. 

Given all that, I just feel completely useless and have started to become really sad at the thought of not being able to have that time with her. We don't meet with speech again until the 30th which is when I go back to work so I don't know what to do. My wife has tried to help me get it but I just can't seem to do it right and it's becoming at my daughter's expense. 

Any words of advice or thoughts or encouragement would really go a long way.

tl;dr - newborn baby is underweight, needs to gain more quickly and with feeding plan from speech, I can't get my shit together to feed her the proper amount and feel useless now.

"Newborn and toddler scared, angry and jealous","My wife and I have a son who is 2yrs and 9 months old. He's incredibly soft and well mannered, although from a bias opinion, he isn't aggressive and when playing with other kids doesn't display any forms of aggression, he doesn't snatch from other kids, no pushing screaming etc. We now have a newborn and he's reacting as expected and would like advice on how to handle our particular experience. 

Whilst pregnant we were always communicating to him that he's going to have a baby sister, preparing everything with him together and just trying as best as possible to make him feel like the big strong brave brother who will help us raise her. He was as aware as possible for toddler to comprehend this kind of situation. 

My wife had to have her labour induced which meant we were in the hospital from Thursday 11am until last night, Tuesday, 6pm. He only saw her Thursday and Friday for a couple of hours when she was allowed to step outside. He saw me during the day for a couple of hours and in the evenings when I would come home and put him to bed then leaving to go back to the hospital. My parents were taking care of him, we all live together so he is very well accustomed to them, and he was putting a brave face on and acting well, didn't misbehave.

Now when we came back yesterday he bit me so hard on my shoulder, many times, we were all crying because of the sheer mix of emotions, happiness joy and sadness based on how he reacted. He was initially frightened but then was quite ok, hugged her, stroked her etc.

Up until Thursday he's never been away from mum for more than a few hours, and now she'd been away for 6 days and back with a baby sister. Were trying to involve him, and he's doing well but want to know what tried and tested ways are there that will make him adapt or take the situation well. A way of not causing trauma.

My wife was operated on and can't lift anything aside from feeding the baby which certainly makes him more jealous. My mum and I are taking care of the baby now while my wife has had a nap with him so they can have their alone time but desperately want advice.

Yesterday was a good day!,"Hey everyone!

I left my marriage for my new family which has changed my sons relationship with me...,"TLDR - I separated from my ex wife and left the family home after having an affair. I moved in with my lover and her son. I made sure my biological son was part of my new family. He feels huge resentment but has hidden his emotions all this time. I have grown to adore my stepson who I am going to adopt and do a name change at his request. We are also having a new baby boy. Am I a bad parent?

I (male) recently was in my biological sons (14) room when I saw his laptop open on this site. He had been posting about the conflict he feels in his life in recent years. Needless to say I was shocked. It is a pretty long post so I genuinely hope you as step parents have time to read it and give me your opinion.

I got married to the love of my life. We had our beautiful boy. Me and my son had an amazing relationship. 12 years into the marriage me and my then wife started to grow apart as people and tension started to rise. I know my son must have noticed this and I desperately felt for him. Me and my then wife decided to split but stay as a family for a set period of time to sort things out. I am sad to say I was having an affair and continued it into a relationship by this point. My wife knew before and after which resulted in the split. When Christmas came my son was eager to plan the day and by that point we knew we needed to tell him we would not be spending Xmas together. We told him about a month before the day. He was very upset and I left explaining I still loved him etc. I moved in with my lover who by now I had fallen for. She had wanted me to leave my marriage for a while and she had waited patiently. She said me staying with his mum would upset him more in the long term.

2 months later I was settled and so was my wife and her son (14 as well.) After a custody agreement it was decided my son would split his time weekly between me and his mother. My wife was welcoming as was her son. My son did not want to come, he was upset at seeing me with my lover but I thought things would settle. Half a year later I got married which he looked visibly distraught at. As I live with my step son I started to adore him and saw him as my own, he was very similar to my son. The boy started to call me dad (he had known me during the affair years) and I was rather pleased. My son was again distraught.

A few odd things have upset him such as... We used to go to WWE matches and he was a fanatic about it, it was our bonding time. I bought a ticket for us and my step son and he said he didn't want to go anymore. Another time he heard me and my wife making love (we thought the boys were out) and he looked devastated. I explained that he knew about sex etc, it seemed an odd reaction. He is never rude but he has totally disengaged from me and my wife and our son. Closed ended answers and he looks so defeated. His school report said he is lively and popular but I don't see this at all. The last thing he asked for me and his Mum to attend an event together and I said no as my wife was dead set against it. Personally I did not want to see my ex wife anyway and I told him that. This was a turning point because there have been many events were I have found out about it weeks later. He said there was no point inviting me or his Mum and that he was no longer fussed. He doesn't ask me for money for anything and then he asked for donations to charities on his birthdays and Xmas instead of presents. My wife said he is being a maytr.",parenting
My 2yo barely eats,"I know it's probably normal and that I'm probably slightly overreacting but I'd love to find out other parents experiences.

My 2yo son can eat like a horse when presented with things he likes such as yogurts, cereal, rice cakes, spaghetti bolognese, cheese and crackers and the usual nice things like cake/crisps/biscuits. He used to love fruit too and lately he refuses it all.

For the past 2 months we've shaken up the evening meal routine so that we could all (me, 2yo and his dad) have our evening meal together at the table. Up until now, my partner's work schedule didn't really allow for it so we're really enjoying being able to eat as a family. 

Except 2yo won't eat anything. Unless it's something that is mince based like shepherds pie, meatballs, bolognese he just won't eat it. Point blank refuses every time and has been doing so for months now. 

I've reduced his snacks so that he doesn't eat anything 2hrs before our evening meal and he won't drink anything like juice in that time period either (though he's allowed flavoured water/weak squash if he wants it) in hope that he'll work up an appetite.

I was hoping that if we had the routine happen continuosly then he'd begin to get with the programme and at least try something but he just doesn't seem interested.

Now I'm starting to worry about how little he will eat some days. Yesterday I got quite upset thinking about how little he'd had all day but he was showing no sign of interest in our tea. 

Just to add that I don't show my upset to him because I don't want him to associate mealtimes with mummy being anxious, we usually leave him to it and give a few gentle encouragements as time goes on.

I guess I'd like any advice from people who have been here or just your stories of it getting better? Thanks for reading this far - I don't have much of a mum community around me so Reddit is the best way to ask all these little questions!",parenting
My son (3.5yo) is fabricating stories regarding my interactions with women and it's damaging my relationship with his mother.,"Hiya community, any help, advice or reassurance on this would be greatly appreciated. 

Some context...

I (M34) separated from my now ex-wife (F30) two years ago just after our son's first birthday. We have a mostly civil relationship, but luckily we agree on parenting style and rarely argue on *how* we raise him. 

Time is split roughly two-thirds our son living with her, one-third him living with me. Ex-wife and I live a 10 minute cycle ride from one another. 

One particular rule we agreed on after we separated was this;

*No partner that either of us date can meet our son until the other parent has met that new partner first.*

My ex was lucky enough to find a decent guy quite quickly and she's been with him for over a year. I met him 4 months into their relationship and he is now a big part of my son's life. 

I haven't had as much luck regarding relationships post divorce until recently. I've been with someone now a couple of months but she has not yet met my ex, and therefore has not met my son. 

*However*

There was an incident when my GF was in my place after his bedtime, my son came out of his room to ask for water and he saw her. He also recognises her face from her profile pic if I'm talking to her on whatsapp and he glances at my phone. 

**The problem** is this; he mentioned to my ex wife seeing one of ""daddy's friends"" in the house and that her name was Erin. She pressed my son for more information and he told his mum that he had breakfast with Erin and I. (Complete fabrication. Wrong time of day for one thing).

Another fabrication; a friend of mine stayed over and slept on our couch. This friend is female, work colleague, a parent herself, but purely a platonic friend. We'll call her Kim. My son said he walked into the lounge to see me and Kim cuddling on the sofa in our pajamas. What actually happened was by the time we went downstairs Kim was dressed and had already folded away the bedding and was drinking tea. 

These two fabrications have caused a lot of distress for my ex-wife as she trusts my son implicitly and takes his word as gospel (her words). 

(Other stories he's made up have included lying about I've cooked him for dinner, lying about me using the wrong cream for his eczema, odd things like this.)

I would love to know;

- Why is he doing this?

- Is this healthy or unhealthy? 

- Can I / should I prevent it? 

The silver lining from this is I'm glad he's at least creative. But I don't understand why my ex believes him. He told me my ex's partner takes him to nursery each morning on a space ship, and I'm fairly certain that's not true.",parenting
Depressed 5th Grade Teacher - need advice,"Hello,

I've got a cute, spunky and full-of-life 5th grader boy.  We had parent teacher conferences today.  The teacher looked like she was wiped out and or depressed.  She immediately started only talking to my son and questioning him as to why he didn't finish his homework, then peering at him closely.  Like he was being interrogated by a detective.  It was so fn bizarre!  

*(Before I continue, yes, teacher's salaries, their workload, their life pretty much sucks.  I get it.  I'm an active volunteer at two elementary schools.  I'm trying to do my part.)*

Keep in mind my son has never been late with his homework. He always scores near 100 on everything.  They recently got Microsoft surface tablets and he needed to do some online stuff so it's not really a big deal, just a paragraph of what he did over the weekend.    But it felt so weird to have her put him on the spot like that.  No joy, no positive reinforcement, no looking at this as a teaching opportunity etc.   

About 15 minutes in she starts in on him again about not speaking up in class, how she's so frustrated with him for not speaking up, how in the future if he doesn't speak up for himself he is really going to be left behind.  Now, my son is a bonafied teacher (in embryo)  in the truest sense.  He loves people and has a real natural knack for helping others.  She confessed that was the reason why she was frustrated with him, because he was helping another child do some work instead of taking care of his own.    Do you see where I am at ?  

I gently interrupt and say, ""OK this is getting strange, why are we talking to him this way, I'm picking up a weird vibe from you.""  She glosses, no, she totally ignores me and continues with my son like I'm not part of the process at all.  I looked at my wife and was like...huh?  I don't make it an issue and just sit there, wondering if my concerns are going to be addressed.  Big fat nope.  

Then at about the 16 min mark she issues her first bit of praise about how he's really good with computers....and she gradually pulls herself out of the spiral and does the fakey oh he's good at this and that.  I really don't care per se what praise she has for him, I mean sure it's nice but he's coming home saying he knows everything she's teaching him.  And not in a know it all way, he's being genuine.

She then goes on to say how she has 29 students and she doesn't have the ability to monitor them all.  But then she says to him how ""I just wish I knew you!"" like she's frustrated with him.  ""I want to get to know you \_\_\_\_\_.""    OK, fine, but you've already established you're over-burdened and really?  You really want to get to know my son?  Why? To my sons' credit, he just looks at her when she gets her highschool counselor sherlock holmes hat on,  like she is wallpaper.

Do I really need to coach my kid on how to boost her self-esteem?

I don't get it.  My kid is hilarious and funny and very creative.  Everything she is not.  I really can't stand her teaching ability and am wondering if I should pull him out and transfer him to another school.",parenting
My son's Mother tries to make him feel guilty for wanting to live with me.,"Due to my ex now living with a ex heroin addict who now is apparently on a methadone treatment plan I decided to only allow our 12 year old son to sleep at his mothers 1 night per week.  More importantly this is what my son wants too as it's very stressful for him to be at his mums. There's also a lot of debt there and she relies on my maintenance payments. 

When he stays there for the night all his mum and her boyfriend do is try to make him feel guilty for not wanting to be there. They do not appreciate how he feels and I think they fear that the more he is at mine the less maintenance I have to give my ex. These guilt trips are upsetting my son. How can I try to deal with this?",parenting

Kid’s Birthday Party Annoying Situation Seeking Advice,"I’m kind of in a sticky situation and am looking for advise as to what’s the best way to approach this...  

My son goes to a Montessori preschool/kinder program.  Each kid in the class has their own folder for projects etc to take home.  I had dropped off an birthday party invitation in each of his classmates’ folders for parents to receive on Monday.  I have already gotten some RSVP from a few parents Monday after pick up.  Comes Tuesday, his classmate, who is a sweet girl, also dropped off an invite for her birthday, which is going to be on the same day at the same time as my son’s birthday party...  

Some might think I’m petty or over reacting, but I got so stressed out about this situation.  I’m a lot calmer now that I had some time to digest it, but I was really upset at first.  I thought, how could they do this?!  It’s already stressful enough to just wait for RSVPs but now are we competing for his classmates attendance?!  I thought about this for a long while and I think I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt.  maybe they didn’t pick up their kid’s school papers Monday, so maybe the parents didn’t see my son’s invitation before dropping of their invitation... 

So this is the situation.  What should I do?  Should I reach out to the girl’s parents?  If so, what would I even say?  My husband said no need to stress, maybe the boys will come to our son’s party and the girls will go to the girl’s party...  Am I overthinking this?  I don’t want it to be awkward afterwards because of this.  I run into the girls parents at pick up quite often...  I understand it takes a lot of work to plan a party and I don’t want my son or the girl to be disappointed.  Any advise is appreciated.",parenting

"My 1st kid vs kid, Mom confrontation","I'm a 39 year old mother of two( boy 9 girl 8). I have never had any problems with my children being rude, mean or causing problmes(yet).

My son is a tall 110lb 9 year old beefcake. He looks intimidating by size but is the typical gentle giant. Anyone who meets him knows this in a second.


The other day he came home and said a boy who lives across the street (who he has played with all summer) hit him in the stomach. I asked if he hit him back and he said no.  I said did it hurt, he said no and laughed. That was the end of it for me. I gave the don't fight speech and that was that.

The next morning the kids mom comes to talk to me about how her son got in trouble in school because my son hit him in the stomach for scoring a soccer goal at recess and her son hit back in defense.

I said that it didnt sound like something my son would do. My son was trying to hide behind a basketball pole scared.( he is super super shy) She said my kids told her son they dont like her which is why they dont say hi to her at the bus stop. She said my son says he doesnt believe her son when he tells him something.

*This whole thing started because her son told my son that he has played every sport there is. My son said that it didnt seem possible for a kid to have played every sport there is, so he said no you havent. Thats when he got punched in the stomach* seriouslt who gives a shit, 9 year olds do..

As it turns out, the on dury police officer saw the whole thing. He said my son did nothing to the other kid. My son was punched in the stomach. Her son lied. Mine didnt.

So heres the thing. She has has 2 opportunities to come up to my son or myself an apologize for calling my son a liar and for punching him. 
She hasnt done it. Today i went to the bus stop and waited for her to come with her son, so we could now discuss the truth of what happened. She never came out of her house. She always leaves at that particular time. So i assume she is avoiding me.

Should I just drop it. Let my son know that he and I know the truth and sometimes just knowing someone is a liar is good enough without an apology. I just feel like my kids need to see that 1) someone came to me with a problem i had no information about  2) i didnt react before I did my research and found the truth 3) im going to hold that perosn accountable for spreading false information 4)  Mommas got your back when you aren't the one caught lying.
Am i thinking too much about it. Should i just stop going to the bus stop and move on and pretend nothing happened when insee them or make her deal with what she wanted to start? 

I'm usualy the doormat for other people. I hate confrontation. I don't want my kids to be like that and i feel like this is a chance to show them to stand up for themselves when someone is wrong. This is hard for me. My hands were shaking this morning waiting for her. Im a nervous wreck. But i have to do this i feel.",parenting
Parents with different discipline choices,"My wife &amp;amp; I have a two year old daughter, who overall, is a great kid. My wife doesn’t discipline, which is frustrating.

Daycare, grandparents, etc. I would not consider myself overly strict, all I want is for our child (and hopefully children) to be disciplined.

"Do the ""terrible twos"" ever really end?","I know there probably isn't a comforting answer to this, just that every kid is different, but my eldest seemed to turn into a monster overnight when he turned two and now at 3 1/2 he just seems to be getting worse every day. EVERYTHING becomes an epic battle, no form of punishment seems to make any difference (whatever I try, he just giggles) and we're all worn out by him within an hour of the start of the day. He's also turning his usually sweet and gentle 1 1/2 year old brother into a monster in training, too.

I guess I'm wondering what percentage of kids actually stopped being so difficult all the time, and at what age that happened?

"Our 5yo is very aggressive/mean to sister, but also angry in general. Causing a lot of strain in our house.","My husband and I have two daughters, 5 and 3. Our oldest is very aggressive/mean toward her sister. She hits her, screams in her face, ruins her toys/art projects, and is just generally mean toward her. Makes rude faces and mean comments daily. The behavior is becoming a huge stressor in our family. We tell her calmly that she can’t be that way, but after the 4th-5th time of the behavior, we eventually resort to yelling at her. Trust me, we are both well aware that it’s not productive...but we’re at our wit’s end with the way she treats her sister. I’m so sad that she can’t seem to be kind to her sister at all, and of course little sister still things that big sister has hung the moon. 

Along with her behavior toward her sister, she also screams at me and my husband, she literally cries and cries and cries if she gets in trouble (time out in a corner or time out in her room). She will completely freak out if something doesn’t go her way (like drawing a new letter, shape, etc) or if we’ve told her no about something she wants to have. I’m talking screaming at the top of her lungs, growling, throwing things, slamming her bedroom door...it’s exhausting. For her and for us. My heart hurts so bad to see her struggling so much, but we cannot seem to help her figure out better coping skills. 

The hardest part is that she’s only like this at home. No one at school, or other family members have ever seen her get that angry. Everyone always tells us how great our kids are. I know and fully understand that we are her safe space, and I want her to continue to feel that way. But this behavior is beginning to cause bigger issues in our family as we’re becoming worried that she may hurt her little sister (overly aggressive behavior) and it’s making our family time not very enjoyable either. 

I’m looking for any advice, books, articles or anything to refer to to help our daughter calm down and to not feel like everything is so “big” to her. 

Also, if you have nothing nice to say, please don’t comment. This is already difficult enough, I don’t need any judgy-pointy fingers right now. I already blame myself for her behavior (because who’s fault could it be other than mine) but I’m really hoping for kind and thoughtful responses as we try to navigate her strong emotions.",parenting
2 year old won't stay in bed and a newborn to look after,"Hello All!

I know it's a common problem. But it's coincided with the birth of my second child, and the usual advice of 'ignore and put back in bed' doesn't seem to be working.

Background: he's 2, in his own bed/bedroom. He has been able to get in and out of bed for a couple of months, but hasn't done this until recently, and now it's every bedtime. The newborn is almost 2 months old, and also requires my attention.

Yesterday's 2 hour nap was entirely filled with me calmly taking him back to his room, and him calmly coming out again. No tantrums, but he's clearly enjoying the game. Same thing at night, though eventually he realised that we'd fallen asleep and put himself back to bed. Today's nap entirely filled with me taking him back to his room, or trying to ignore him. I can't keep taking him back to bed because the newborn also needs my attention (feeding, settling, changing...).

**Clearly the toddler wants attention, so how to balance being repetitive and insistent about him staying in bed with giving him the attention that he is obviously missing, and also looking after a newborn?**

Toddler's schedule, until recently entirely stable: up at 7, breakfast at 7.30, indoor play until 9, outdoor play/long walks until 11. Lunch. Usually midday nap until 2.30. Reading or play inside/outside. Dinner at 5.30-6. Bath, potty, books, teeth, bed at 7.45. He essentially sleeps soundly all night. (Partner away for work from 8.30 until 5.30.)",parenting
How do I proceed with my daughters preschool?,"So, this is my daughters second year of preschool. Last year she went to a different preschool, this year she started a new one that is closer to our home. We have had a few problems and I dont know how to proceed. 

Incident 1 happened last week. She came home with a pocket full of broken glass and plastic she had picked up off of the play ground. They moved school buildings this past year, so this is their first year there. Janitors are supposed to complete a check list and clean it every day, but my daughter managed to find glass they somehow missed.

Incident 2, happened a couple weeks ago. She had a bowel movement at school, the bathroom is in the classroom so the teachers are right there as they are going. She came home with poop in her panties and all over her where she wasnt properly cleaned. She had been dirty like that at least two hours. 

Incident 3, about a month ago. Her class had fruit roll ups for snack. I picked my daughter up early only to discover she was eating the roll up, with the plastic still on it. She ate half of the roll up, with the plastic on it. Her teacher says ""I try to get to all of them, but sometimes I just cant make it in time"" and claims my daughter should speak up more when she needs help with something like that. (My daughter is very quiet and takes a long time to warm up to people.) 

Incident 4, about three weeks ago I pick her up, she has band aids on her knees. She says she fell on the play ground. As I'm putting her in her car seat, she moves her bangs over and theres a huge bruise on her head the teachers completely missed. 

And then incident 5, today she got mad at me because I told her that she couldn't have orange juice until she finished her water. She responded with, ""shoot yourself!!"" Yall. My kid just turned four. My heart melted hearing those words come from her mouth. I had a talk with her, she broke down crying because she knew it was mean to say, and eventually she told me that she heard a little girl in her class say it. She says the girl didnt say it to her, she just heard her say it. I dont know who she said it to. 

I've talked to the director of the preschool about all the incidents but the last one. I've had continuous conversations with her teachers, they have been very understanding and trying to help me get to the bottom of these problems. But I dont know how much more of this our family will put up with. My husband is ready to pull her out, I'm currently a stay at home mom with my 6 month old so its doable, but I dont want to over react. 

Is this just a part of public schooling? Are these problems that all parents and students deal with? 
How do I proceed? I would hate to pull her out, because school has helped her in SO many ways. Would it be over reacting to pull her out and keep her home until I could get her in with her old school? Theres a super long waiting list, but that's kind of besides the point. 

Any advice or input would be so helpful.

Edit- the poop incident, she pooped in the toilet, and didnt properly clean herself. For her, poop is a big deal. She has hated pooping literally since she was born and tries to hold it until she cant anymore. That's been a long battle for us, we haven't really focused on her cleaning herself properly because we have been so focused on just getting the kid to poop in the first place. She is on a daily dose of miralax, that sometimes works.",parenting
daycare and nonverbal toddlers,"hi y’all. first time poster in this sub and not sure if it really belongs here.

I have 2 girls currently in daycare, 2 and 3 years old, and they’re both nonverbal and currently both in speech therapy. Both were born early (one at 35 weeks and the other one at 32 weeks) so I knew they’d be behind in SOME things. Speech was one of them.

My current issue is this: today I picked up my girls and the daycare director told me that my 3 year old has been hitting other kids. I was a little shocked, but not too shocked. Since my girls share a room and everything in it, there is hitting, but I stop it and I defuse the problem right there and then. They do not talk enough to tell me what happened, just who hit who and that is that. They usually are really well behaved, when they are NOT playing together lol. My three year old loves to play by herself and my 2 year old likes to butt into everyone’s business and follow my oldest (my 6 year old son). But there are times where my son doesn’t want to play so my 2 year old plays with my other daughter and 80%, it’ll turn into a fight over a toy.

The director asked if my 3 year old hits at home, and I said: “not really, unless she is playing by herself and 2YO is bothering me. She likes to be by herself.”

Daycare director told me that parents have been complaining about my daughter.

I am a little hurt; they’ve been in this daycare since August and this is the first time I hear of my 3 year old hitting anyone at preschool. She said if it continues, they would have to kick her out. But the thing is: my girls can’t tell me if someone is bothering me, so I feel a little miffed that they’re completely blaming my 3 year old for her behavior.

I don’t know what to do. I really like that they go to daycare. They have flourished so much.

My mom used to watch them but my mom didn’t do any school things like a daycare does, but my mom understands that my girls are nonverbal and need that extra attention sometimes.

Should I just go back to having my mom watch them? Or should I stick it out and hope that my daughter stops hitting? How do I help my nonverbal girl understand to not hit?

TIA. :(",parenting
The oh-so-terrifying...toilet?,"My daughter (3.5) has been potty trained for a while. No serious issues while potty training besides the usual. Haven’t had any issues/accidents in a looooong time...until the past two months. She has, for reasons unknown, developed a crippling fear of public bathrooms. 

At first, it was a fear of ANY toilet that wasn’t her toilet at home, but now she’ll use the toilet at nana’s house, at daycare, and one specific toilet at church. 

It isn’t the flushing that scares her-it’s literally the toilet. When I (or whoever else) takes her to the bathroom, she loses her religion. She will lock her legs and scream until she nearly throws up. There have been times where I have been legitimately concerned that police will be waiting outside the bathroom for us, because someone called 911 due to her screaming. She’s started having accidents again just because she’s so dang scared of using the bathroom anywhere but her “safe” toilets. 

So, two questions:

1. Any theories as to what on earth could have triggered this? She’s neurotypical, and like I said, she’s been using the toilet for 1.5 years no problem. 

2. Any ideas as to help her get past it? About 6 weeks ago, I tried taking her to a public bathroom and letting her pick a treat if she successfully (read: not eat piercingly) used the bathroom. In the days leading up to it, I hyped it up, telling her that she’s a big girl and I believe in her and that I think she can be brave and use the potty and that I’ll be there with her to help her because I love her. It worked, but last week she all of a sudden started getting scared again. I want to help her work through it, but I don’t know how. 

Give me your best, Reddit. I hate that she’s having to miss out on stuff because we can’t go out and count on her using a public restroom.",parenting

Am we wrong for not wanting to throw our 3yr old a normal birthday party?,"Hear me out...

He had a huge first birthday party.

He had a smaller second birthday party, but he was not very social with everyone that came. He wanted to be around his grandma or aunt, not everyone else.

We at first started to plan a party for him (invited a few people, etc.)
But now, we think it'd be better to actually go to everyone's houses.
This way, he can actually spend time with everyone one on one.

To be honest, I don't think he really understands the whole birthday party thing, I think he just knows he's getting gifts and cake.

We will still be getting him his own cake (on his actual birthday -a week and a half before the scheduled party), and he'll obviously still be getting gifts from us and everyone who decides to give them.

Part of my husband's family can't make it due to a family member being induced the day before, and part of my family can't make it either, due to work.

So, are we in the wrong for not wanting to have an actual party for our son?",parenting

I dont spank or such but I threaten that playstation. Girlfriend stops me sometimes saying I cant always use that. Okay what am I supposed to do?

6 year old peeing her pants,"My daughter has suddenly started peeing her pants at school. This has never happened before. She hasn't even wet the bed since she was 3. She doesnt have accidents at home. In the past two weeks, she has peed 5 times at school. She wont talk about it. Absolutely refuses to answer any of my questions. She tries to change the subject or tell me it was just water. Her teacher doesnt know what's up either, but it reminding her to go to the bathroom frequently.

We have a nurse from the Dept of Health coming tomorrow afternoon to help us figure out how to navigate this situation, but I dont know how we can even begin to address it if we dont know why its happening??

If anybody has any suggestions for how I can get my daughter to talk to me, I would really appreciate it. She has never kept things from me before. I've approached all of our conversations by explaining that I'm concerned/want to help/not mad/etc., but it has gotten me nowhere.

Shes a very anxious child and this is her first year at school with full days. I recently had foot surgery, so our routine has changed somewhat during my recovery. I dont know if either of those are playing a role. She has no medical conditions. Doesnt seem to have a UTI. She does have a weird bowel movement schedule, but she has since they day she was born, so idk why constipation or something of the sort would have symptoms like this out of the blue, but if the nurse cant figure it out tomorrow, I'll be taking her to the doctor asap.

What to do about a 3rd grade antagonist,"Our son is in 3rd grade this year, and so far the year started out better than last year. He has an IEP for Autism Spectrum/Asperger's that helps him deal with emotional regulation and fine motor skills. His teacher sends home charts each day assigning a number to each scheduled activity and how he coped with doing it (0 for try harder, 1 for nearly, 2 for completion) . He'd been getting basically all 2s for his ability to regulate as well as get his work done. For once, he actually wanted to go to school and he was having no issues at all.

That is, until the antagonizing started. There's another kid in his class who seems to have made it a personal game to bother our son. It's little snide comments, tearing him down, making faces,  contradicting him to be contradictory, and generally winding him up for a reaction. Unfortunately this boy also has lots of friends according to my son based on his antics whereas our son is ""that kid"" who talks about things no one else knows about and is the ""weird"" one. Son has done a decent job of ignoring him or telling a teacher when there's an issue, but lately he's been  expressing he doesn't want to go to school or needs a day off. He says telling the teachers does nothing or he gets told ""just ignore him"" which if you know the autism spectrum has its limits. 

Today he came home and told me that he finally snapped and chased after him on the playground, only to get in trouble and he had to sit out/got 0s for recess. I emailed his teacher about the situation but I'm worried that because our son feels he has no other options he may resort to violence because he feels he's done trying so hard to be the one who regulates everything.

What’s a standard babies birthday party?,"I’m starting to plan my LOs first birthday. I haven’t been to a child’s party since I was one so I don’t really know what the standard is. I’m planning to hire a soft play and invite her friends from the different classes we go to/ provide snacks for the kids/ decorate with banners etc. This roughly adds up to £270 for 2 hours/9 babies and 11 grown ups all in all. 

My partner thinks this is a tad over the top and I can totally see that. It’s so easy to go over board with party planning. Though I also worry about maybe not doing enough. For those more seasoned parents who’ve been there done that; what’s the standard toddler party like?

EDIT: thanks for all the feedback guys! I think the most likely course of action will be axing the softplay in favour of hosting at home. Although the space is small it’ll save heaps on spending and I feel a lot more confident that none of the other mums will be judging, thank you xx",parenting
Smart 1st grader with behavior issues,"First time posting here and I’m hoping for some sort of ideas of what to do next. 

Firstly let’s talk about my son. He is extremely smart to the point he is too smart for his own good. He can be manipulative if you aren’t smart enough to know better. He’s creative and funny. He has an unusually high vocabulary and speech skills. He loves nature and being outside getting muddy. He’s also very shy and what seems to be high anxiety. He attends an environmental school which lucky for us has a great curriculum and opportunities for him to experience. 

He has a hard time initiating simple things such as making friends and asking questions to adults when he needs help. Supposedly he has NO friends and he says nobody likes him. I’ve seen him play with kids while I was volunteering for the school as a teacher assistant and the uniform lady. 



Currently our son has been acting out and showing destructive behavior at school. From ripping up his class work and books to throwing chairs and making messes in the bathroom. He has now been written up for his behavior 3x in the past month. We have constant communication with the teacher along with phone meetings and recently an SST (student success team) meeting to address his behavior and sensory/developmental issues. At the meeting I thought great ideas were all on the table from all perspectives. All the people who attended including social worker, special education director, speech pathologist, etc... stated that he is such a great, sweet, smart kid and are shocked about his behavior. Nothing has changed besides the weather. When behavior started the punishment was indoor recess to work on his class work.  To him this was a benefit because he says he has no friends to play with anyways and recess is boring. So now that recess will not be taken away he has continued to act out at school. 

He’s been saying now for the past 2-3 weeks that he doesn’t feel well and he has been taken to the doctor multiple times where his pediatrician states: “he’s fine, nothings wrong, he’s 6 years old this is normal behavior.” I’ve even gone as far as to have his PD make a written statement for the school of what he has told me. We also think it’s more anxiety making him have stomach aches because when I was his age I felt the same exact way and still do. We’ve done many different strategies as far as changing his diet and sleep schedule which clearly has no effect. 

A little back story is: In pre-school he was sent home every time he acted out or said he was sick. That resulted in a very long meeting about how wrong that was. 

He does not act out at home and lets be honest he’s not a total angel but he does NOT show this behavior at home. He is extremely remorseful every time and I have given him consequences (no tv/game time) at home due to his unacceptable behavior at school. Honestly my kid is being a JERK at school for no reason. It doesn’t matter how many times we talk about it he always tries to place the blame on someone else in the end. 

Any ideas? Anyone experiencing the same issues? WTF should I do next!? Am I being too mean taking away tv time because he’s being a jerk?",parenting
I’m taking your advice,"For those who have gave me advice in my last post, will be happy to know that I have decided to back up on being harsh on my son.

He apologized on putting it on too harsh as well. On another note that my family does not know of, I have decided to sell my brokerage to my partner and move forward in life. I have accumulated enough wealth to live comfortably with, and I want to see that my children can have a sort of advisor if they need it and a father.

Has your toddler ever rocked in their sleep?,"I honestly don’t know how to explain this but I’ll do my best and I might be better off posting this on a medical sub but I’m going to try here first. 

My daughter is about to turn 2 and since she was 6months(ish) she would roll to her belly, tuck her knees under her and rocks  in her sleep (just like the fetal position). Normally, I wouldn’t be alarmed by this but when she does it she continuously bangs her head against her crib like .. *rock* BANG *rock* BANG.  She doesn’t do it every night and she does eventually stop, I would say it lasts a half hour max. but sometimes it will come and go throughout the night. 

I tried putting up crib bumpers to hopefully protect her head but it doesn’t seem to be doing anything. She is also perfectly healthy otherwise and she has no injury to her head when she wakes up. I have gone into the room to see and she just rocks.. I say her name and she just keeps going, she’s still in a deep sleep. I have pulled her back down to the centre of the crib and away from the “walls of the crib?” and she stops for a bit but she sometimes rocks her way back up to the top. I have also just tried rubbing her back and that makes her stop. 

I have brought this up to the doctor and she didn’t seem concerned at all.. I am just worried about her head because it seems like she bangs it really hard. It also keeps my husband and I up at night because the banging is so loud. 

I’m just wondering if your children did the same or if you have ever heard of this? I have tried googling but I never knew what to type in or what to search for.",parenting

Is this even remotely normal routine?,"I (male) nor my partner (the mother) are in employment and really do not have any other similar responsibilities....
So they are not considerations here


Anyway, 5-7 am the baby will wake up and be awake for 30 minutes on a good day but most days at least 1 hour and in that time she’s screaming and being difficult....
Then she will wake up 30-60 minutes later and be awake until 11 but being tired and fussy while crying LOTS... 
EVEry day I have her at those times until the mum wakes up usually around 11am 
Then I will give her the baby whenever she is ready to take her and then I’ll try to go back to sleep, extremely stressed out..., And if the baby needs to nap (most of the time), she will keep me awake and insist that she can not put the baby to sleep so I must stay awake and do it....
Then she takes the baby for around 2-5 hours, usually closer to the 2 hours

Then I wake up and she will very quickly give the baby back to me...,, where she stays until she goes to sleep at like 9pm  - I’m the one putting her to sleep 
At this time I will be extremely burnt out and unable to handle the baby without anY  frustration m so she will occasionally take the baby for maybe half hour and give her back to me so I can put her to sleep

Then at around 1am she will wake up for a bottle and I will have to take her 99.9% of the time


Then time will quickly go until it’s suddenly 2-3 am and I’ll go to sleep 
Having to again wake up at around 5am to take the baby EVERY day.



How is any of this fair or normal?

Is 18 months a good age to introduce a pacifier?,"Our daughter is 18 months and still breastfeeding. She was exclusively breastfed until about 6 months. We tried to introduce pacifiers several times during the first months but she hated them. We tried about 10 different brands but she would just make an ""eww"" face and spit them out. She always seemed to prefer comfort nursing.

Eventually we gave up on the idea of a pacifier altogether. We gave all of them all away save for one which somehow ended up falling in her toy basket. She eventually found it but used it as a toy and not as a pacifier.

But 3 days ago things changed all of a sudden. Her molars and canines have started to come out and she spent the whole night biting and sucking her finger. In the morning she grabbed the pacifier in the basket and spent the whole day biting it compulsively, at the side of her mouth. Yesterday she transitioned to sucking, to our complete surprise. When she goes to bed she now insists on the pacifier and cries when we take it away.

I'm not sure what to do. It seems like a late age to introduce a pacifier, but on the other hand, if it helps, why not?

How to explain family dynamics to son (4M),"Both my husband and I have somewhat “non traditional” families. I went no contact with my mom in early adulthood and my husband was raised by his grandparents since he was a baby because his mother struggled with addiction. As my son is getting older he’s asking questions about me being in my step-mothers belly (to keep things simple I’ve been telling him she’s my mom, since he knows her as grandma) and why my husband has “two moms” since he has met both the grandmother who raised my husband and his bio mom (family decided to introduce bio as grandma too, Which I hesitated to do but didn’t feel it was my place to correct.)

Any tips on answering these questions and explaining in an age appropriate way? I’ve explained in the past that all families are different when he asks about why his friends “don’t have a dad” (they do, the parents are just separated and he’s never met their dad). I just want to give him honest information before he gets too old and feels misled when he finds out the truth.",parenting
Toddler and new baby,"I need help! I have a 23 month old and a 6 week old and we are struggling with some major jealousy issues with my toddler hitting/ grabbing her baby sister. 

It started out right away with some grabbing of baby’s hands and feet out of curiously. When this happened we encouraged soft hands and moved on to something non baby. About 2 weeks after baby’s arrival the behavior moved to grabbing feet mostly when baby was nursing and taking up moms attention and lap. Now she is grabbing baby’s face and even threw a toy at baby yesterday. Luckily her aim is terrible and baby slept through the incident unharmed. It happens sooo quick. Sometimes this happens when baby is getting attention she wants and we know to watch for this and be extra cautious but sometimes it’s when baby is getting zero attention (asleep in wrap or pack and play) and we are playing with her! She does not hit us or other kids or babies at daycare. 

We have tried having her play and practice with dolls, showing us soft hands, increasing one on one time with us and having her help care for baby. She enjoys helping with baby and has times where she talks sweetly to baby or wants to share toys or food with her so it’s not constant. Currently were keeping them apart as much as possible but baby is getting less sleepy and less content with being in the pack and play all day while my husband is at work. 

When hitting occurs we tell her “it’s not ok to hit baby, if you hit you go to time out” and we put her on a designated time out stool. She stays in the spot for about 2 min but we have to be right there to keep her from leaving time out. We don’t talk to her while in time out, trying to make it as boring as possible. Once her time is up we talk about why she was there and have her tell us the rule “ soft hands” and then apologize to baby. She does not seem to mind time out so I’m not sure our method is working.

Anyways I am looking for any and all advice on how to reduce hitting and keep baby and toddler safe while also not loosing my mind.",parenting

1.7 year old and the pacifier nightmare - can't get her off it,"Hi guys! I know theres a lot of posts about pacifiers but my little one is acting the opposite way of how other kids are acting and I don't know what to do. My husband looses it within the first 10 -15 minutes of her crying and starts yelling and cursing and I can't bear it.

Here's what I did -

I used the pacifier fairy method and gave her a toy instead and first couple of days she was very happy! Didn't ask for the pacifier much and was generally happy. Then the nightmare started. She refuses to take a nap (she takes only one in day time) and after playing a lot and tiring her out, she cried a bit and slept for just 45 minutes. Wakes up all grumpy and doesn't stop crying after that, refuses to communicate and just cries. If she came to me when crying I can keep her in another room and distract her to stop her from crying or try something, I don't know. But she wants to go to her father and no one else. He starts yelling and cursing if she doesn't stop crying. So after 4 days, I gave her the pacifier again.

I'm lost. Because all other babies cry and fret since the beginning and she seems ok without a pacifier for the first couple of days and then starts. I've kept cutting the tips of the pacifier as a last option as I've heard its dangerous, but many have tried it and it seems to have worked.. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if I should ask my husband to stay over with his parents for a couple of weeks till she becomes normal, but seeing how she wants him to comfort her, I'm more scared of this option.

Does applying some horrible tasting thing to the pacifier help? Can anyone suggest anything to apply to it? (she likes lemons and likes sour things so that won't work)

Any help is appreciated. Thank you so much guys!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  

Thank you so much to everyone who answered!! Actually I read some articles about how its bad for a child's teeth and some articles say within 1.5 months pacifiers should be rid of and also, we live in a place where almost no one used pacifiers so sometimes when we give it to her in public people stare at us weird. Not to mention my in laws have been pestering me to get her to stop using it. They don't tell my husband anything about it, and I didn't want to start needless conflict between them so I hadn't told him.

Well, we discussed a lot after reading all the comments here and have decided to wait until she's over 2.5 to try again. And, he's going to talk to his parents and told me not to worry about that. He told me that they gave him and his pacifier for years, haha. We're will be trying some of the new methods you guys have mentioned and see how it goes.",parenting
My Child Will Not Communicate – Any Help??,"My son is 4 and 2 thirds ( 5 on December 27th) and he started school at the start of September.

We have had this issue as he is an only child he plays and does everything himself and does not communicate well.

Well, he came to us last week to say another child (who he kinda knows as there mum is friends with my wife) pinched him, we spoke to the other childs mother and she apologised etc and said it was because she was unwell.

It was the first time so we just accepted it and moved on, now our son said it happened again yesterday so this time we spoke to the teachers who said other than lunchtime they were never out of there sight. 

We ask our son but he is very vague and sometimes says something happened, we Ask the same thing again 10 inns later and he gives a different story (which at his age is maybe something we need to work on).

But because we are not 100% sure when talking about the pinching from yesterday that he may have been talking about last week, we feel pretty powerless with this, until he communicates better.

4 year old and constant meltdowns.,"My DD has these meltdowns often. I guess they are somewhat normal at her age, but how do I deal with them? I can handle the meltdowns at home but I’m concerned for the ones that happen while we are out and about. When she has meltdowns while driving, I tend to ignore them and she eventually settles down. But then there are the times when I take her places and she refuses to leave. Here’s an example;

I took her to see her mom. Her mom is an elementary school teacher. Things were going great up until it was time to leave. She played with the other kids, had snacks and went to recess with them. But as soon as it was time to come home, all hell broke out. I kept giving her time limits like “ok, 5 more minutes and we need to leave” and I’ll set a 5 minute timer. My DD then responded “no! I don’t want to go home! I want to play in the playground again!” I said no, that after the timer goes off, we need to leave. She then got angry and started pouting. 

Once the timer went off, I told her it’s time to go. Nope, she wasn’t having anything of it. I told her that if she wants to come back in the future, she needs to make a better choice and go. Nope. She started crawling under the desks. I then had to carry her out kicking and screaming after we argued for a few minutes. Once we got to the car, she refused to get into her car seat. This went on for another 5 minutes until I eventually closed the door and drove up the street, at which point I pulled over, turned off the car and told her that we aren’t moving until she gets into her car seat. That took about 30 seconds and she agreed. After buckling her in, the ride home was much better. 

So I’m reaching out to you guys. Because this issue is becoming much more common, how do I deal with this? These public meltdowns are just becoming too much to handle. How could I have handled the school meltdown better? How can I deal with these public meltdowns better?

Another thing too, is when I pick her up from the sitters after work, she sometimes doesn’t want to leave and the whole process starts anew, just like when I brought her to the school to see her mom. 

I wanted to add to, that I feel horrible for driving out of the parking lot with her not in her car seat. Granted we were near the school on a residential street with no traffic, but still, it’s something that I know I shouldn’t have done.",parenting

I need help,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My 15 year old son is doing poorly in school. First, he always wastes all his homework time and he is generally unfocused when he is supposed to be doing homework. Instead, he will be doing things like picking at his eraser or surfing the internet about video game stuff when he is supposed to be doing homework. We tried turning off the wifi connection, but he figured out how to turn it back on. Now it's at the point where I have to be constantly policing his work every 10 minutes to make sure he is not wasting time. Second, he does not pay attention in class -- he doesn't take notes and is instead constantly daydreaming off in la la land. Before high school, he could easily do all his assignments at the last minute and not take notes, but still get good marks. Now times are changing, and he is failing to adapt. He has gotten a few less than stellar grades this year, and he still fails to turn things around. I seriously am at a loss as to how to help him. Additionally, he has no friends and has no interest in making any. We tried therapy, but it didn't help because he didn't want to talk to the therapist. He has had a psychological examination by the school, and they didn't see any signs of mental issues like depression. He also doesn't have any problems like bullying, drugs, or trauma.

Then unfortunately a couple months in I developed a serious health issue and wound up getting fired for excess absences. Company badmouthed me a LOT around town. They wanted A lot more say in my medical care than I felt was appropriate. 

ETA: Physical Heath issue. 

While I was getting back to health and still looking for another job, I’d volunteer sporadically at the school. Still one of the more frequent faces. I’ve been doing some freelancing while I finalize some medical treatments and look for a permanent job. 

The other day I was pulling out of the parking lot w my kids in the car after a few hours of volunteer work, when the mother of one of my kids classmates, her own kids in tow, walked up to my car and knocked on the window.

Her: Hi! I hear you’re not with Old Employer anymore. What happened? How come you didn’t like it there? 

Me: Good to see you Karen! Wow, Old Employer was over a year and a half ago. You remember I was struggling medically; they fired me when they learned that I would need yet another major surgery.

Her: *cocks head, look of wide-eyed confusion, gasps* I -I don’t understand. Didn’t they like you enough to keep you? 

Me: I assume it was business need. But I wasn’t FMLA-eligible. 

Her: Now why aren’t you at work today? Don’t you have a job? *eyeroll, sigh* Nevermind. I can get you a telemarketer position probably. *Hands me a card*. Here, send me your resume. 

Lady,... you went out of your way to confront/neg me in front of your kids and mine; butthurt that I was setting up a fundraiser benefiting OUR kids’ school, to imply I should take a min wage job with a masters degree. 

Way too much investment in my personal business. 

I’m obviously angry,  but so hurt and humiliated. I’ve been VERY harshly criticized by a lot of people for all the time I took “to relax” (in the damn hospital after recovering from multiple life-saving surgeries). Several of the moms at that school ARE nurses at the hospital where I had my surgeries, and know damn well that my health problem is legitimate.

At the same time, I’ve really come to enjoy volunteering at the school but... not if THAT’S how I’m going to be spoken to, and in front of my kids! 

Kicker: Based on how my job search has been going, I have reason to believe that I will be getting a lower six-figure offer letter soon. I’m very excited. 

What say you Reddits? 

My inclination is to just take the six-figure job, and not say anything to these snobs, just let these people keep talking shit about my perceived underemployment, not realizing that I’m actually making a decent salary. (I stay low-key on social media).  And honestly that out of nowhere confrontation - you know it’s not just one person. 

It would be too petty to email her HR director like, “Karen thinks my masters degree and I are perfect for this $10/hour min wage role you’re “always” looking to fill!” Right?",parenting
Daughter forgets her things all.the.time.,"I was wondering How other parents feel about responsibilities for an 11 year old. She forgets all tasks and stuff to bring to school... it’s just so tiredsome to help her remember all the time. Should she be responsible for making sure she had everything needed for school or is it normal that I have to remind her of all the thing to bring. And to remind her to check her class journal/task sheets. To brush her hair and to change underware. We have the same routine for 6 years now, she still does Not know what to do on a daily basis... I’m just so frustrated and want to talk to her tonight, but it have been wondering. maybe I am expecting too much of her?

How do I survive with a newborn and preschooler.,"I have a 2.5 week old baby and a preschooler who just turned four. I have no family support. My husband works 12 hr days. I had a c-section so the recovery has been really tough. I can't drive or climb stairs. We arranged help (which we can't afford on my husband's single income, he's also studying fulltime) - we pay a babysitter $250 per week to get my daughter ready for preschool, drop her off and pick her up. My mother is extremely selfish and won't help me in any way. I have no siblings. My dad can't help either as he's working full-time

Grumpy ass kid.,"My daughter (2 yrs, 3 mos.) has been an absolute grump the last week. She seems to cycle between a few hours of being discontent with everything and shorter moments of being happy and playful.

When she's in her mood she doesn't listen, doesn't answer, will throw a fit at the drop of a hat over nothing. When she does talk, she does that whiney mumble so we have to ask her 5 times before she tells us. Try to give her a hug? Just ask to be hit in the face. We put her in time out but that doesnt seem right with a kid that's already acting like a dick.

I know these are all symptoms of being a toddler but it's the fact that she is in such a bad mood most of the time over the last week.

Additionally, she has been waking up again through the night. When we go to get her back to bed she screams, ""Nooooo!"" and fights. She practically gator rolls back to her bed.

There havent been any changes for the negative here or at daycare (where she's a dream, apparently). 

Is this normal growth related stuff? Because what the fuck, Chuck? This kid is moodier than a teenager.",parenting
Child crying until they get attention.,"What are some of the long term effects of giving into a child when they start crying?

To give some context:
My wife and I are trying to sleep train our daughter (two years old). She falls asleep and we put her in bed. When she wakes up in the middle of the night she will cry until my wife soothes her back to sleep. This is only temporary because she will do this several times throughout the night. She tries to let her cry but eventually she'll give in and soothe our daughter to sleep. My wife can't pull away until she passes out, but again this is only temporary until she wakes up again and it starts all over again with the crying.
This also applies when she throws a fit. Our daughter will cry and cry until my wife gives her attention whether it be negative or positive usually negative in the form and yelling in her face, whooping her butt, or threatening to whoop her butt. 

I feel like this is just a vicious cycle. My daughter doesn't really throw tantrums around me and if she does it doesn't last long. When my wife is around she will cry til she does something happens. Now our daughter gets plenty of experience, attention, healthy meals yada yada. 

I'm starting to notice that once my wife leaves the room for something our daughter will have a  complete meltdown until she comes back. Our daughter will incrementally amp up her tantrum until my wife either yells at her or gives in to what she wants. 

Another question: what can I say to my wife? She doesn't believe me when I tell her that she is making it worse everytime she gives in. I tell her that you are teaching her that as long as she cries, no matter how long it is she will get what she wants.",parenting
Second child guilt,"My baby girl was born on Friday the 11th and we got to bring her home to a very excited big brother on the Saturday.

He’s 5 this week and being our only child for 5 years, he’s been the centre of attention and fussed over and had us all to himself and he’s definitely a daddy’s boy. Cliche to say, but he is my best mate, we do loads together and as we’re both Marvel mad, we do a lot of cool Marvel days out like live shows or exhibitions and it always feels like a day out together as opposed to me taking him out, if that makes sense. 

Since bringing my little girl home though, I just feel so guilty. He is so made up to be a big brother, always giving her affection and offering to help when he can, he’s been brilliant and given me absolutely no reason to feel like he feels like it’s a bad change, I just can’t help but feel maybe from my end I can’t be the dad he’s been used to and it kills me to think he’ll feel like maybe he doesn’t matter as much any more and it’s all about his sister. I keep finding myself trying too hard, like being more affectionate than I normally would, just to make him feel like he’s still loved and still special. 

I don’t think it helps that the birth was so traumatic and emotions have been all over the place since. A 24 hour labour which ended in a midwife pressing the emergency button during what felt like a casual conversation. All of a sudden, the room was filled with people rushing her out and leaving my in the room without an explanation as to what was happening. Next thing I know I’m in theatre watching my girlfriend get cut open and our baby rushed out in, what felt like seconds. The rest of the day I was an emotional wreck, seeing her so out of it and what she’d been through and just the mix of emotions. Don’t think I’ve cried that much in my life, and I still feel like I’m close to tears the whole time. 

TL:DR - I guess I just wanted to ask other parents who have had another child who may have felt similar and how they got over it or reassured themselves?",parenting
Need a car for 3 kids plus car seats. Any recommendations?,"Hi All,

Currently awaiting the arrival of our third child, currently have a 3 and 5yo who are in a car seat each (a joie stages seat, so quite wide).  So our predicament is finding a car where we can comfortably have the existing car seats, plus an isofix'ed silver cross baby seat, then eventually, 3 car seats.

Would also need room for the silver cross (wayfarer) pram base in the boot.

Does anyone else have this kind of combo of kids/car seats and could recommend a car suitable?  We've been to a couple of car places, but not many have 7 seater cars, so we probably need to know what type of car we want then to find that one specifically somewhere.

We've got a budget of 12k at the moment.

"First ""friend"" birthday party","My son is in 4k and has his heart set on a friend party, so I rented a table at an indoor playground type place and am going to invite his whole class of 22 kids, because the class rule is to invite everyone. I have no idea what kind of turnout to expect but my hope is that about 4-6 kids actually come. This is new to me and I'm not sure what to say on the invites. Should I ask parents to stay for the whole party? At the age of 4/5 the parents should stay, right? Should I rent a second table if needed for the parents to sit at or is space for just the kids to sit and eat enough? (There is other seating around the place for parents to sit while kids play). The party is on a Sunday from 2-4, do I need to serve snacks too or is just cake fine? Do I need to have enough cake for the parents? How far into the party should we do the cake and gifts?

11 yo daughter wetting herself,"11 yo daughter (started secondary/high school last month) has been coming home with wet trousers/pants. We spoke about it, seems she forgets to use the bathroom before she leave school and then during the 20 minute walk home, she needs to pee and can’t hold it.


We’ve spoken to her gently about it and reminded her to go before she leaves school or stop at the cafe which is approx halfway home. 


We’ve also told her firmly that if it happens, she needs to shower straight away and put her laundry in the washing machine immediately. She has not been doing this and has just been changing into other clothes. As a result, she smells, her laundry basket/bedroom smells, everything she sits on smells...



For example, it happened I think 3 times last week and again yesterday. Each time, she has had to be told to shower and put her laundry in the wash - sometimes told twice.



So we’re dealing with two issues here - the actual wetting, and the lack of willing to deal with it when it happens. Last night we found wet trousers/pants stuffed under her bed.



We spoke to her about it again last night, made it clear she wasn’t in trouble and that we were just trying to help her deal with it. 



I think we should be making an appointment with the doctor because there’s either something medical going on or - could she be depressed? She refuses to eat breakfast and we’ll often find untouched lunch in her bag. She will have a large dinner in the evenings and will eat normally over the weekend so we’re not concerned about an eating disorder per se, just unhealthy eating habits during the week. 

Another thing is she will do her best to leave the house with (long) messy hair that’s not tied up, while we encourage her to brush it and tie it up. She generally leaves after we do. This on its own wouldn’t bother me but with the other issues, I’m concerned it’s part of a bigger problem.

It’s a Good Thing.....RIGHT?!?!?!😬,"Using This as my journal
Today...so this was this morning!
(Btw my son is 17 and considered severely autistic)
Welcome to my world
Spent All night repairing the side security screen door (Logan managed to push it off the frame😁🙄)
He’s 6’4”, 210lbs;)

Was SO happy to finally sleep
In my bed and not in the living room (with one eye open) so he doesn’t leave.

I recently taught him how to use his iPhone to make calls. He uses FaceTime
All the time now placing orders from his room to ask me to bring him a water!LOL!

He FaceTimed me this morning while I was sleeping, and YEP, “mom, water please” it wasn’t until my eyes could focus that I realized he was at the AIRPORT!😂😳😊

..and YEP, ...my door is again pushed right off the frame..

Thankfully not LAX but John Wayne, (which is closer) I kept it cool and said, “wow Logie! You at the Airport?”
“Yea, mom water please”
Me- “ok Logie on my way!”

We FaceTimed the whole time while I got dressed and drove there!
I pulled up to the terminal with perfect timing! He was just walking out, with his rolling back pack, I waved and pulled over, he waved, “hi mom... I love you mom..??” (Just to make sure I wasn’t mad;)

We went for breakfast and then home!

Welp he got that out of his system!
I’m actually very impressed and if it wasn’t for him “breaking out” I would have never known he could have done this!?
(I would have NO CLUE) how to take busses there🤔)

I asked if he got in any trouble in the airport and he said No, he CAN’T lie so I believe him;)

He just walked around got thirsty and too tired for the trek home😊❤️🤙✌️

It’s a good thing right?! It’s not me being a Terrible parent, it’s a good thing!!!
Right???

“Just us” family time on weekends and holidays,"How do you guys balance the hectic life of parenting while ensuring that your kids grow up having strong bonds with your extended family members? 

Now that I have my own family, I really enjoy the “just us” time, meaning spending quality time with my husband and our two kids. M-F when husband is working, the kids and I have lots of social playgroups we attend. 

My kids and I thrive on staying on schedule. Because of their ages (5m and 19m) they have different nap times and my house is a constant project to keep tidy. I enjoy the struggles and craziness that comes along with having two very young kids. 

Most of our extended family (parents, siblings, cousins) live in different countries but husband and I have 3 siblings that live relatively close. I find that having people come over for weekend visits are *extremely* exhausting to the point where I just want to shut down. Because we live on an island, it means our nearby siblings have to take a quick plane ride or ferry in order to visit, so day trips aren’t possible. We have strong relationships with these siblings and they’re always eager to come see the kids. Husband and I both want to ensure my kids experience all the love and bonding that comes with family. BUT DAMN, I *really* need them to stop visiting... like please don’t visit us until 2020!! 

My husband understands where I am coming from. He is very supportive but seeing extended family is also really important to him, especially since all but 1 person from his family live on a totally different continent. None of our siblings have kids - a big factor because they don’t really understand that naps and mealtimes have to stay on schedule.",parenting

My daughter isn’t behaving at school.,"My daughter is in fifth grade. This entire school year so far has been a struggle; she has a stricter teacher this year than in years past, and she is having a hard time adjusting and following his rules. One of his rules is that the students must keep their desks clean and organized, and he has periodic desk checks to make sure the students comply. If he deems their desks too messy, they have to stay in during morning recess to clean. Today they had a desk check, and apparently, my daughter threw a fit right before it was her turn to show her teacher her desk. Then, when he told her that she had to stay in to clean her desk, she asked if she could go to the bathroom. He let her go, but then she never returned to clean her desk. He then made her stay in during the longer lunch recess to clean her desk. I was so embarrassed when he told me what happened at pick up today, and I told my daughter that she couldn't watch any TV or use any electronics all week. I admit, I was pretty angry when I declared this, and I know you're not supposed to punish kids when you're angry, but I don’t even know what to do with her.",parenting
Anyone else have experience dealing with child banging their head/face when they wake up during the night or morning?,"Our 20-month old is a great sleeper and napper for the most part, and she's able to fall asleep on her own. A few months ago she began hitting her face and head into her mattress while on her stomach whenever she woke up. Sometimes it's light tapping, but it usually builds until she's lifting and hitting her head/face/really hard. She's been kicking her legs down into the mattress now, too, which makes a loud thud and probably keeps her awake.

I know this is generally a soothing technique for babies and kids, but it really has us worried that she's hitting so violently. Luckily she's not hitting her head on to the actual crib, and she generally doesn't do this while she's up during the day. Plus, we don't have any signs of behavioral or cognitive issues (other than general bratty-ness/stubbornness sometimes).

Whenever we go in to try and soothe or or give her some milk to go back to sleep it's clear she's wide awake, so it seems like she's doing it to signal to us that she's up and wants attention/milk. If we do give her some milk she usually goes back down and falls back asleep no problem, so we're trying to make sure she eats well at dinner time so she's not hungry.

Anyone have tips/advice? Our doctor said not to worry about it and that kids will do that, but it's definitely keeping us up most nights and we want to make sure she's not hurting herself. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",parenting

Needing some serious advice for this losing battle,"WARNING: lengthy post

I have a 15 yo daughter who in the past 2 years has gotten herself into trouble. Let me start off by saying she is a top swimmer at her school always pulls above a 3.5 gpa. Engaged with her siblings, seems so be happy. On the outside she looks like a model teenager........she is anything but. In the last year we have found out she was sneaking boys into our home while we were sleeping and having sex. She was vaping, stealing our alcohol, tried acid, sent inappropriate pictures to boys (which of course got out to everyone at school)I mean this girl has done it all and still managed to keep her grades, sports and family life in check.  I think I’m pretty good at looking for signs of this behavior but I kid you not, I had literally no idea. Once all of this information was discovered she threatened to hurt herself, which was not taken lightly. 
Now let me say she come with a lot on her plate, her dad walked out when she was under the age of 1.  She struggled along side of me while I put myself through school. And 2 years ago I remarried, had a baby and her real father is making a valiant effort to be in her world (with little success). 
So here we are with all of this information and what do we do? We have a psych eval. done, we put her in an intense group therapy twice a week along with individual counseling. We put her on birth control. We took her phone. I placed her in a local volunteer group. Her and I became very close through all of this. 
Fast forward 6 months, she is back in school and because of her previous actions. She created quite the reputation and even more so with a particular girl who just seemed to have it out for her and despite me talking to the school about her being bullied, the girl follows my daughter into a bathroom at school and beats her up. 
I once again disconnect her from social media which was being closely monitored. We try to disconnect her from the videos posted of her having her ass beat and the comments that came along with that. But even now we keep catching her in all of these little lies. It’s just constant. She seems to lie about anything, even insignificant things. 
I really just don’t know what else to do, I feel completely defeated and a failure as a mother. I can’t seem to help her and teach her to value herself. It’s really heartbreaking and I fear that all of this will just break her down even more. As a parent, what do I do? I truly need advice because I am losing this battle.",parenting
Autism Parents - Stuck in Survival Mode,"It’s been 18 years.
You'd think I'd be used to it by now right?! Rarely having a full nights sleep, doing the same routine every night...making sure every window and door is locked and drilled shut, hiding every tool, drill bit and butter knife (make shift screw driver) in the house. Finding new hiding spots for my keys (then forgetting where I put them). Turning on house alarms, buzzers, ipad and security cameras, making sure his GPS is charged. 

Sure I ""go to sleep"" but is it truly sleep if your keeping one eye open and a ear out all night afraid he will elope again?

Running to the Grocery store to get food for some mothers can be a little bit of a break. For me, running errands consists of rushing, sweating, having zero patience for lines, staring at my home security cameras from my phone and and looking rude when I don't have time for small talk with the cashier.

Daily life consists of constantly scanning for threats, will he be here when I wake up? Will the police knock on my door again? Will a neighbor complain? Will he be in a good mood? Will he take his medicine? Will he break something else today? Will he lash out at me?  Of course I don't blame him for any of this, I blame the parts of his Autism that he can't control for it.  It's not his fault and I know he hates it as much as everyone else. 

It is what it is, but yep...I'm not used to it, pretty sure he isn't either.  I don't know if anyone ever gets used to it.  Being constantly on guard, with little sleep and always trying to stay one step ahead is EXHAUSTING. 

I had mentioned this to my doctor when talking about my stress. How my body is literally stuck in an anxiety type position.  The best way to describe it is the way your body would tenses up if you're anticipating a car crash, except, there is not crash and you're lying on the couch.

This was when I learned that Hyper-vigilance wasn't something that happens after deployments with Military Personnel. Much like PTSD, it can happen to anyone in the right situation.  

Its when your subconscious is constantly anticipating danger, your senses are on high alert, ready to spot and respond to any danger, and your fight or flight response is just stuck in a sort of Survival Mode.  It's the brain's way of protecting the body from danger. There was once a story written about how being an autism parent is similar to that of a combat soldier and I'm guessing that this was probably where the comparison came from as Hypervigilance is common in combat soldiers. 

While it won't go away on its own, it is treatable, with the initial recommendation of removing the individual  from the stressor.  obviously a parent isn't going to remove themselves from parenting but this is the reason that the whole self care thing is no joke!

Taking time off, getting a break and having an outlet is so important! If you can't get away, try writing, journaling, whatever takes your mind off things.  That's the first step!",parenting

Yet despite everyone telling me I’m doing all the right things....

I constantly feel like I’m not because he doesn’t listen or he throws tantrums. His teacher tells me how he doesn’t listen or needs to be redirected. He’s rude to others and bossy.

My wife will be stay at home the maximum amount of time work/state permits, and then we will go back to work 8-4 mon-fri.

Traveling partners? Share your stories,"My husband travels for work, not a TON, but 25-30%, which translates to around once a month, but sometimes nothing for a while and then a long trip. 

Anyways, I work full time (teacher) and we have a 2.5 year old and one on the way. He works 11 hour days, which isn’t insane, but I’m alone with my daughter a lot.  I am finding myself resentful of his job, and worried about how I’ll handle two kids.

I know we’re lucky that he has a good job that he likes. I know there are other people out there in similar (and more challenging!) boats, who manage this with good attitudes... tell me your stories and survival tips please!",parenting
Tweens and teens,"There isn’t much of a question here but I just needed to vent. So doe background, I am a recent widow, but for context he was arrested for domestic violence after a year of physical and mental abuse brought on by paranoia and meth addiction. He was always a strict dad to my kids and I always felt the need to shelter them from him, when I knew he’d be pissed. 

He committed suicide the day after went had our first court date for our divorce. It was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do, tell my kids their dad was dead. 

Anyhow, I get zero help. My kids are 10, 12 and 14. No one does their chores. I can’t get them to even bring the trash cans in after trash day or empty the dishwasher without a fight. I beg and plead for them to help, offer them money to do laundry and pick up after themselves. Things they should be doing just as normal chores. I got them cats because when my husband left he took their dog (his girlfriend has him now because I got the cats, it was better for her to keep them and I was ok with it), but no one will clean their boxes without me screaming. I try so hard to parent without having to yell because of what he put me through, but no matter what I do they don’t listen. I take what little stuff they have and it doesn’t work, I offer money it doesn’t work, I tell it doesn’t work, I am nice it doesn’t work. I’m just so exhausted and overwhelmed with laundry piling up and being gone for 12-13 hours a day. 

Now I just flipped out on them and was freaking out and my boyfriend called me and probably thinks I’m insane. I just wish I could be happy. Have a clean house and a normal life. I can’t even keep my own room clean at this point because my daughter trashes it when I’m gone.

Getting additional info regarding party,"2 weeks ago I received a text from the mother of one of my son’s (8B) friends, asking if my son was available on the 19th for her son’s birthday party.  We didn’t have any other plans, so I said yes.  I assumed she would be sending an invite home.

I'm 26 weeks pregnant and having panic attacks and anxiety because I want to be a perfect mom.,"Sorry for so many info but I needed to give context and background so you can understand my anguish. 

I'm pregnant (21), with my boyfriend (21) by my side and all the support in the world (financially speaking and yes, I can say emotionally too). Lately I've been going through a lot of stuff in my life, as my parents getting separated, stress from college (plus the stress of graduating soon, just 12 classes missing, so I can work and take full responsibility of my baby), struggling with my health (Insulin Resistance and Hypothyroidism, which at this point my levels are normal and stable thanks God, I'm anemic too, that makes me feel exhausted most of the time, not helping with my anxiety), my mother in law is super nice, I really like her, she is nothing but good to me and treat me like her daughter but I think she is more excited than me, she wants to organize the baby shower, organize where we are going to live, what stuff do we need, in summary she wants to do everything and I'm ok with that, the thing is that she is mentioning this almost all the time and I'm feeling like pressured which, again, doesn't help my anxiety, but I know I need to start doing all of that like NOW, the baby is coming sooner rather than later and will need me stable and organized and I'm trying to figure out how to organize, what to do, how to do it. My mom is happy and waiting him to arrive (it's a boy btw) but not doing a thing, she has bought about two things for the baby and then she doesn't mention anything else, I mention something of the baby shower or about the baby and she just nod or changes the subject, I don't feel her so excited about it as my mother in law, which I don't feel totally supported by my mom and that makes me feel sad really, I don't know if she's still disappointed or mad at me or is just this thing of the separation that keeps her down (she has a lot of debts right now too and I don't know if she's focusing on paying them or she's just giving her some time to think, I don't want to think she's making me aside but 🤷🏻‍♀️idk) that gives me anxiety too, getting into trouble with a really good and close friend, another huge big deal is if we are going to live at my house or his, which is a big decision to make, my mother in law already told me like ""you can come and live at our house"" which I told my mom about the OPTION and she cried like a week because she doesn't want me to go and she thinks that she is a bad mom that's why they are making me that offer, so more stress and anxiety to me because now I have to think in another problem in my life, how to not hurt my mom's feeling, and other problem is that my mother in law wants to be in charge of all the baby shower organization and achievement and an aunt of mine is already planning one so I don't know how to tell my aunt that my mother in law is already taking care of all the things and not hurt her feelings too, but the main thing that's making me go crazy is the birth.

I want it to be natural, but I'm really scared! That day, I'll be alone, just me and the doctors, with a lot of pain, nobody holding my hand or saying me I can do it, crying my soul out, and a lot of women in the same room trying to bring their babies to this world too, suffering same or worst than me, they will be screaming or crying and I don't like many people around me, I feel sofocated and anxious and now picture a terrified child (me) with anxiety, a lot of pain and surrounded by unknown people, I will feel like an ant in the floor that everybody is watching me, I know my heart will come out that day, I don't know why but I have this feeling that I'll get complicated and I will need a c-section and that my tachycardia (because of the anxiety) will cause trouble to my baby boy and they will take it from me to attend him and all the possible worst case scenarios come to my head and being honest, I'm feeling mortified, I'm really striving to be a good mom because I already have the trauma of what is not to have a really nice bond with your mom (my mom and I have...really hard time getting along) and I want my kid to know that I want to be a loving and caring and supportive mom to him. I'm doubting about myself if a could do it, another problem in my life, ta-da, I have low self steem so I'm reallyyy doubting myself in this part of my life, my bf got my back, he is so calm and loving and will be a great dad, he's been such a great boyfriend and partner, I'm hoping to have his example and guide me to be patient to our son because his parents are so calm and patient with him, so he already knows or at least has a way of how to do it.

Now, my panic attacks. Since I notice that I was pregnant my mind is in power mode OFF when thinking about negative thoughts or things that scared me or makes me feel bad, so I know all this stuff and what I being doing is suppressing all bad emotion and thought. Now, my body doesn't know what to do with so much stress and anxiety and is causing physical pain (panic attacks) telling me to calm down, cool off. I've been talking about it but not being aware of the real problem until my endocrinologist told me I'm having panic attacks and that I need to fix the problem, now I have more anxiety because what I've been fighting for (to keep my baby aways of all negativity) hasn't been working and I hasn't been doing a great job at hiding it and making sure he is as happy as he can possible be in my tummy, I'm failing as a mother already:(

Just to be clear, I'm not diagnosed with anxiety but at this point I think I need to see a psychiatrist, I have migraine too and to keep them controlled they gave me pills for anxiety, which they helped at the moment but I left them because of pregnancy and I don't know if I can take them again.

I really need advice, I don't know what to do, what to expect, how to feel, I'm feeling cloistered.",parenting

My son (5) misses rest time at school for Enrichment and it's affecting his behavior at home,"My son is in Kindergarten (he is an only child) and in the Enrichment program. In our district, there's a distinction between the gifted program (required IEP) and ""Enrichment"", and he's in the latter.

His school day is 7 hours total. Every day, the Kindergarteners have a 25 minute ""rest time"", which is essentially nap time. The kids can choose whether they nap or just rest, but my son has told me he naps at rest time.

Since he started Enrichment a few weeks ago, he's missed rest time every day, as it's scheduled at that time. For the first week or so, he also missed snack time. I think his regular teacher and Enrichment teacher arranged their schedules so that the Enrichment kids would no longer miss snack time, and he's been eating snack at school.

His behavior at home has been, well, not great since starting Enrichment. He has been steadily growing out of the complete meltdown tantrum phase since he turned 5 earlier this year, but since he's been in Enrichment he's had a bit of a meltdown every day after school. As far as I'm aware he behaves well at school.

Today post-tantrum, we had a discussion about what feelings he has before he misbehaves and what we can do to help him make good behavioral choices. He suggested a sticker chart (which we've used in the past and has worked for him), and I've made it my goal to help him express his emotions in a productive and healthy way. I'm not gonna kid myself and expect him to act like a 9 year old at 5, but prior to him starting Enrichment, his behavior was typical for a well-behaved 5 year old.

My husband and I have discussed it, but we're unsure as to whether or not we should pull him out of the Enrichment program. Our son really likes Enrichment and says he wants to stay in it. I know he's not really being challenged in his regular class (his teacher talked to me about this), but I can't shake the feeling that at his age it's more important for him to have rest time than Enrichment considering he has a long school day for a 5 year old and he's still getting used to the transition between Pre-K (which was 3.5 hours a day with no school on Wednesdays) and Kindergarten.

I really don't know what to do about this. Since he enjoys Enrichment and is not being challenged in his regular class, I'd like him to stay, mostly because it makes him happy. But I really feel that his recent behavior issues are a result of missing rest time for it.

I'm interested in hearing other parents' opinions on this, and if your stance is ""keep him in"", I would love to hear some tips on how to curb the misbehavior at home. My son is an energetic little boy, like the majority of 5 year olds, and we've had behavior issues in the past which we've addressed, but this has been a difficult time for all of us, as my husband is often on-call for work, and I just transferred from a community college to a University and essentially tripled my class workload.

TL;DR: My son's Enrichment conflicts with rest time and he's been misbehaving/throwing tantrums after school. Should I pull him out of Enrichment? If I should keep him in, what else can I do to help him regulate his feelings/behavior?",parenting

When you realise your 9 year old has his first “girlfriend”,"What do you do?! Is this normal at this age? He’s written “name + name” in a big heart in a book - I mean he’s 9!

I’ve seen them holding hands once and, either because I caught them or it was just coincidence, they let go of their hands as soon as I saw them. I know his friends tease them that they love each other. 

I would love to get to the stage where he will be comfortable to open up to me - I guess this will happen if he knows he won’t be judged or criticised? But how to get the right balance of empathising while ensuring that 9 year old relationships don’t go astray? Please give me some pointers or any personal stories will be great to hear.

worried about my daughter's friend after being told about abuse.,"Over the weekend, my daughter's friend confided in me, and another parent about abuse she is receiving at home. All the girls had a sleepover for Halloween and one of the girl's birthdays. They are all just beginning middle school. 
The girl really wanted to come home with us. I feel horrible and worried. Having bad anxiety. I asked her what she means by her saying her mom ""hits"" her. She says her mom hits her, knocks her down, pulls her hair, is often passed out drunk, different men in and out of the house. They are new to the area, and none of us other parents have even met her mother. That was kind of bizarre for all of us. We've all met and talk regularly to each other. She doesn't know us at all. She just pulls up to their house and lets the girl out. Never coming up to even see where or who her daughter will be with. She says they just moved here over the summer due to a domestic situation that got her mother kicked out of the home she was renting. Supposedly the old boyfriend dangled the girl over a grill. He also held her over a second floor railing by one arm. Eventually cops come so I'm not sure how this was only reported as a ""domestic"". So they were evicted.
The mother and father of my daughter's friend that had the party, all discussed this and what we should do. The little girl is scared of her mother finding out she's trying to get help. I felt for this girl because it was like seeing myself at her age. I had the same type of ""mother', and was taken away a few times. After reaching out to my own father for help, and him getting proof, we were finally placed with him. So it's quite personal to me. I decided to call the school's guidance counselor today, knowing they have to report instances such as this. She was very concerned as well. She did call the girl into the office, and she is making a report.  I also had to call her back today after school, due to a note the girl wrote me last night to pass along. It's awful and describes what her mom did to her last night. Includes claims her mom dragged her by the hair and made her eat soap before being thrown in the shower to wash up. She wrote in the letter she tried being quite but still mad her mom mad some how.
I hope she can get help. I gave her a big hug and my word that I'd do all I could. My stomach hurts and my hands are sweating. I'm so anxious. I fear the mom will retaliate or get even more abusive if someone doesn't step in. I remember how my mom would react when I showed my father bruises. I'm taking the note to the school tomorrow. The guidance counselor will be including it in the report. Has anyone else ever had to deal with this? How did you handle it? It's breaking my heart knowing right around the corner from me a girl could be getting abused.",parenting
A rare day with my son,"For context I'm married, we have two kids, wife has just gone back to work after maternity leave. 

My 3yo boy is recovering from having his tonsils and adenoids out. We've been taking it in turns between wife, grandparents, and me taking care of him while he recovers. I had two days last week which were lovely. 

But today was special. 

Today we broke the rules. Today we did not wash and fold the clothes. We did not hoover and clean the bathroom. We did not avoid sitting on the Nice Rug. 

We watched too much cbeebies, until the twirliewoos came on because we both hate the twirlywoos. We had chocolate spread on toast instead of butter or jam.
 We didn't remove the random crap he puts in the supermarket trolley, so we now have a pack of useless size 1 nappies, some flushable toddler wipes, a pack of giant crumpets, and some flax seed. 
We ran around the supermarket because it was quiet and we hadn't been out to play for over a week
We didn't eat all of our lunch before going to play, because sore throats are a pain
We made pizza dough, and then watched Turbo, even though we'd already watched far too much TV that day
We napped for too long
We didn't cut up our pizza, but tore into it with a feral rage reserved for people who didn't eat all their lunch but should have
We did 3 poos on the potty
We went to sleep past our bedtime because  nap was too long
We watched Sophie Ellis Bextor read ""Mog in the Dark"" because it's the 21st century and other people can read bedtime.stories now. 

But we didn't argue. Not once. There were negotiations, there were tears, and there were plenty of ""nos"". But for the first day in a long time, we didn't fall out, and every interaction with my son was completely positive or at least constructive. I've already forgotten half of the things he said today that made me laugh but I'm left with a profound feeling that it was something special. Tomorrow I'm back to work and I don't know when I'll have my little boy all to myself again. But for now, it was safe to say we had a Good Day.",parenting

Giving alcohol to infant,"We have a family friend who we've known and been friends with since high school. Shes a good egg over all, but has family issues and drinks to keep the edge off. I've never seen her drunk, but she does throw some booze into her drink and sips contently from her straw when the kids get too crazy or if her husband is getting on her nerves. 

One night we were visiting and her 1 year old waddles over to her drink and starts chugging from the straw of what she explained to us 5 minutes ago was Yeager and some other ingredients. I jumped to stop him and she told me not to bother him and it was fine. I took the drink anyway and he started crying and she started giving me shit for taking the drink away from him. I told her I'm not going to let an infant go to town on his mom's booze. She quieted down. Didnt want to fight. 

Last night we went back over. My wife learned from their teen daughter that the whole thing with the drinks is every day. She let's the infant have drinks because ""it keeps him happy."" My wife brought it up with her and she said that her daughter over exaggerated and that he only gets a few sips here and there. 

...""BUT YOURE STILL LETTING HIM DRINK BOOZE! It doesnt matter how much you give him. The kid is drinking poison"" I interrupted. 

I was asked to leave. So my wife and I left. 

Jesus christ, what do i do? Call the cops? It's one thing if the kid just got a hold of the drink and took a sip or something, but this chick isn't exactly trying to stop him and even sharing it with him. Can someone please tell me I'm not overreacting to this? Am I allowed to be concerned about this?

Thanks everyone who replied. I know I'm not wrong but it's those pesky friendships that cloud ones judgement. I'm on it everyone. Thank you.

How do I make them understand?,"
My Son has ADD. He is having issues in school and with focusing. We are a very active family. We walk, play sports together. Bike a few times a week. It's not a surplus of enegery. Home work ends up in crying fit because he is bored. Etc.

And I am going to be putting him on medication. My family is against medication. And thinks its all bullshit. 

I had severe ADHD growing up (still have it.) My parents refused to medicate me. This caused a struggle throughout my teenage years. My confidence was shot, I was getting 50% out of a possible 100% in all my classes. A few teachers called me stupid. Etc. I dropped out of high-school. 

I went to adult education and obtained my diploma. At 22. I decided to medicate myself for my ADHD and I was able to pass grades 9,10,11 in about two years and had an average of 99%. The courses were set to whatever speed you work at.  I have since stopped the medication. I have found other ways of being able to focus. But I don't think my 8 year old son will be able to adapt my methods so easily, without some intervention first.

I don't want my son to have those same struggles. My family still thinks ADHD is still made up illness. I understand that many kids are wrongly and overly diagnosed with ADHD. This is a genetic trait that runs in the family. All the men on my father's side have it. Hell my dad is 65 and is still hyper.

Token System Brainstorming,"I am hoping to get a little creative help from all of you.

I am looking to implement a token system in our home that will hopefully have multiple benefits because 1) Ive noticed my kids are starting to feel entitled and 2) I want to start teaching them the importance of earning and saving.

So what I would like help with are ways to earn tokens and things they can spend tokens on.

Standard chores are non negotiable. Putting away shoes, picking out clothes, taking care of dinner plates, cleaning room, making bed etc. Its something everyone has to do no matter what.

Various occurrences will cost a ""fine"". Such as not listening, lying, hitting, etc.

Here are some ideas I have so far to ""earn"" a token or two:

* No nail biting for a whole week \*Im getting desperate\*
* Getting ready for school hassle free without prodding
* Cleaning up the room all week without being asked once
* Doing extra chores from a chore chart such as: Dusting, sweeping, pulling weeds, shoveling snow etc. \*chore ideas will be helpful and not all chores are equal in payment. Harder chores will get more tokens.
* Behaving exceptionally well during events/out in public without intervention or reminding
* Doing all homework and reading 30 mins every day without being prompted

Here are some ideas to buy with the tokens:

* 5 tokens: Candy or a treat of some sort
* 5 tokens: Getting to pick out dinner and help make it if they so choose
* 10 tokens: A small toy/book
* 50 tokens: A medium sized item they want such as a toy or clothing item
* 50 tokens: Skipping out on chores for the weekend with no consequence
* 100 tokens: A larger toy or item they want

I want to be liberal with the options to get the tokens since I only have them half of the month and they do very well with praise/reward rather than punishment but I will also ""fine"" them for bad behaviors so they also have the ability to lose tokens rather quickly too.

Its important to me that the learn the value of working and earning instead of things just being handed to you, just like how we as adults work and do things we dont necessarily WANT to do, but because we HAVE to for a paycheck to pay for our own needs and wants (Though I know some of my options seems a little counter productive but we struggle with energy sometimes and being able to contain themselves IS working hard when they are consciously doing so). It is also important to me that they learn the importance of saving. Its not something I was taught young and I had a really unhealthy relationship with money....I would consistently buy a bunch of small things, go out to lunch, etc and never got to really indulge in bigger things such as quality bags, a newer car, vacations, etc because I never had enough money. I want them to understand that instant gratification may pay off immediately but it can be so much better by sacrificing the smaller things to get something really nice/indulgent.

I also will not do chores for cash. I want to be able to have a little more control over the giving/taking and its going to reflect more than just chores.

Nap problems?,"Trying to figure out of my 8 week old's 20-30 minute nap trend is a phase or a sign of something else. 

Over the last week or so she has only been taking short naps during the day. She falls asleep usually by 9-10pm at night and will sleep 3-4 hours, then wake up to eat every two hours until morning. 

No matter if she falls asleep with minimal coaxing or if I work on her for an hour, the naps are the same length. She has also been fairly fussy on and off between naps which leads me to believe she's overtired. 

The room is pretty dark, she's swaddled and has a sound machine. Anyone else experience this??",parenting
Thoughts on keeping daughter in preschool with kids that do not speak?,"My daughter is 2.5 yrs old and has been speaking full sentences for a year and is very communicative. She is in a preschool class full of 16 month old to 2 yrs old that do not talk. Recently, she has been mimicking these kids at home by crawling and making baby sounds when she wants something; when I ask what she is doing she continues to make baby sounds and eventually says ""...this is what baby NAME"" says. The schools says she is not old enough for the next class and we need to wait about 3-months.

1. Does this sound like possible regression or just play?
2. Would you pull your kid out of this class based on being kept with kids like these that do not speak?

I wanted to punch a child,"So, this is a feeling I've never had before. I was at the park with my kids on a sunny day, enjoying the playground. My 1-year old boy is enjoying walking and running around; walking is still fairly new to him. He's a little chunky sure but looks like most 1-year olds you see. To my right there is a group of (I assume) middle schoolers; they look about 11 or 12. Like 3 of them. And one starts hamming it up for his friends, saying ""look how he walks, he walks like this,"" and doing this ridiculous walk with his back arched and butt and belly sticking out. I realize he was pointing to my little boy. The other middle schoolers laugh.

Being an adult, I ignored it of course. But it brought such a rage up within me that I wanted to share, lol. It's not that I care about some kids' approval. It's the realization that to the rest of the world, or to a few small people anyway, my son is meaningless, something to be laughed at, even. When to me he is the light of my life. His smile and laugh are infectious. He is the happiest, most carefree and outgoing, adventurous little boy you've ever met. I love him more than words can describe. And to think that there are people who don't see his value, it just gave me such a rage.

I went and told my husband and his reaction was the same. Like, what? Those little punks over there?? Lol, obviously we all said and did shitty things when we were 11; mostly just to get a laugh out of our friends even, not even because we really meant it. So I get it. That perspective made me feel better. But I just wanted to share since the feeling was so new to me.

Also I'm trying to be self-aware that I shouldn't become that piece of shit mom that thinks ""my kid can do no wrong;"" as a former teacher, I can attest those types of parents are the worst and raise the shittiest children. I should get real used to it now that the rest of the world is not gonna think my baby boy is the perfect little angel that I believe he is!",parenting

Time sensitive query: overnight with scouts,"Tl;dr kids (6&amp;7) are in scouts 2 weeks, their troop is going away over night to a scout hall in a forest. 15 mins awayShould I let them go?

So, tonight I found out that a trip had been organised by my 2 kids scout troop, text messages didn’t get to 70% of the parents so we found out half an hour ago. The overnight is this Saturday but my kids are literally in scouts 2 weeks.  They both want to go but I’m very anxious. Ex husband (their dad) isn’t up for it (the weekends are his time with them) 

One of them has bad asthma, not a problem when managed, the other is very hyper and finds it hard to settle at night. Adding on to that, as nice and qualified as the leaders are, I don’t know them well at all. 

Would you allow the kids to go on the overnight camping trip?

ADVICE! dropping out of school/bullies,"my youngest daughter would like to drop out of high school due to bullying. she is 17 and a really bright girl. very kind but very mild mannered, surprisingly a lot like me. she would rather drop out than try to confront the students again. shes tried independently and with administrative help multiple times. i do not want to tell her no but despite her maturity and rationality i am worried she will make the wrong choice. as a child i faced extreme bullying for being a chinese immigrant as well as being gay, at the time we did not know about transsexuals or transgenders. i started skipping school at a young age and i eventually dropped out as soon as i could. i remember walking past the prom, just to get a glimpse of those beautiful dresses. my biggest worry is she will regret not attending prom and that will lead to regret about missing other teen events. she is not as girly as my oldest daughter but i know the few friends she has would help her have fun. at the start of the year she bought fabric and was going to make her own dress but after the bullying started just exactly the same as last year and the year before, she has just given up. her grades are failing already when shes been a straight A all her school career. it is only october. i try to be as understanding as i can, especially since i know it is hard to deal with and i chose to drop out. these days there is online school, but she wants to get her GED on december to start working. i know she is almost 18, in fact she will be this school year, so i know she can sign herself out but she would not do it without my approval. my husband told her that he supports her choices if she feels like it will help her, i said the same thing but i didnt know if i was okay with it yet. my husband is a wonderful man but the rage in his eyes when she would come home in tears is unlike anything ive ever seen from him before. i am the sad one, he is the mad one. he blames the school but in my opinion with social media theres only so much of it they can do. hes very tall and very hairy, i had to clarify that he wouldnt go big foot on the principal. my eldest daughter says she should not drop out. i do not want my angel to suffer but i do not want her to regret waiting it out a few more months. 

does anyone have similar stories of their bright children deciding to leave school? how has it gone for you and your children? do they have any regrets? -michelle",parenting
9 year old son refuses to go to school,"My 9 year old son is the hardest to get to school. I have 2 sons 13 and 9, the thirteen y/o is a typical tween. Grumpy, additude, and a little mouthy at times. But in all never too hard of a kid ever. My other son on the other hand I have had one thing after another with him. From being born with severe fluid in the ears and 4 weeks early. Weighing in at almost 13 pounds. (Yes I had gestational diabetes). He has had speech therapy because he didn't babble or talk like normal kids do. He didn't even really start to talk until 2. He started preschool at 4. And ever since then he fights me going to school every day. I have had meetings with his teachers, asked if there is anything going on, maybe I can help fix the problem. I have tried bribery with everything from special snacks in his lunch and after school if he goes, class pizza parties that I would pay for if he went every day. I even tried to pay him cold hard cash for every day he went. I have taken away his television, video games, and he is only allowed educational toys. He still refuses to go to school every day. He says there is nothing wrong he just doesn't want to go and he will fight until he is physically sick. Most days he is a good half an hour to an hour late for school just from fighting me. He has already missed 7 days of school this year. He is on a permissive transfer and can only miss 10. I am at a loss what I can do next. I am so tired of fighting every morning.

My daughter complained about her mother hurting her,"My (23m) ex (21f) and I have a 4 year old daughter together and split care 50/50. 
My ex is not the most amazing mother, she’s a narcissist and very emotionally manipulative- she doesn’t listen to anything anyone says and basically lives in her own world. She resides with her grandparents, aunt and two young cousins in a large home so I like to believe there are enough other caretakers that my daughter never goes neglected or unloved. 

My daughter often makes comments like “mommy never plays with me,” “mommy just watches tv all day,” “mommy is always on her phone when I try to play with her...”
These comments bother me but anytime I bring them up, my ex brushes it off like it’s funny and doesn’t matter or affect our child. 

BUT then, this week when my daughter comes over she says “mommy kicked me off her bed” and I said “was she being funny or was she being mean” and she replied, “she was being mean- I asked her to play and she told me to leave her alone. She kicked me off the bed and I fell on my head.”

My daughter is definitely not one to lie, besides that she said it so nonchalantly she didn’t seem to realize there was anything wrong with this behavior.

Breast pump question.,"Sorry if this isn’t a good place to post this. 

I get a breast pump through insurance, I think it’s the in style medela one. But I can choose a different one if I want. 

I can do; 

motif Luna

 lansinoh signaturepro

spectra s2

motif duo

elvie $375

spectra s1 $135

medela sonata smart $275

evenflo deluxe

evenflo advanced 

medela freestyle $225

lansinoh smartpump

Most of those cost nothing, or $30. But a few are upgrades, so they cost a little more which I put next to them. I’m going to buy two I think, I know insurance will only cover one. 
I really want the elvie for work. Anytime I spend pumping I have to clock out and do not get paid for. Which a girl at work told me takes her about 45 minutes each time, with cleaning and everything. Plus we have one a small room with a curtain for a door next to the bathrooms and drinking fountains. There is room for three chairs, but the girl said it’s usually full (3 people already using it) and there is no privacy while in there. So she has to pump in the bathroom or find a corner to hide in. We have over 2000 employees so that’s hard to do. I’d rather just be able to pump while I work (I sit at a desk all day) and empty it when I need to. 

Has anyone used the elvie? Or any of these other pumps? I want one that plugs in for when I’m at home, which do you suggest? Do you have to pump often while working? Should I get the plug in one through insurance and the elvie on my own or the other way around?",parenting

"Mental illness, teenager, help!","3 years ago, my son was hospitalized (about 11 years old). Initially for suicidal ideation but he also admitted to hallucinations and having someone else in his body... he was himself until about age 2/3, then something (someone) entered his body and they've been in a fight ever since, that one is evil, the other is nice. 

He was released, attended counseling and the psychiatrist only had him on medication for his ADHD. Eventually the ""other person"" and hallucinations were forgotten about and as of now, he hasn't taken adderall in over a year. 

He'll be 14 tomorrow and I just received a call from his school. He's okay, everyone is okay... but he's been talking to his friends about the other person in his body again..  how he's the evil, psycho side... this side is verbally abusive... and a friend of his admitted to my son strangling her. Not enough to really hurt her, I guess but still, strangling is a big thing. My son claims he doesnt remember this ever happening. According to the girl, this happened months ago (over the summer? Which doesnt make sense since he didn't really hang out with any girls over the summer... so maybe last year around school time- except it didn't happen at school, the counselor made it a point to say that.. no one can tell the counselor when it happened, just that it's been months). I do plan on speaking to my son about all this when he gets home.

But now I'm wondering what I need to do. He's in therapy so I have a call in to his therapist. Family history has schizophrenia, schizo-effecto, bipolar, and other things that I'm not sure is related to mental illnesses (addiction too). 

Is he at the point of needing a psychiatrist for medication to help this ""other side"" of him? Does his therapist make that recommendation? Do I just take him to his primary doctor? The old psychiatrist he was seeing, I felt like she wrote things off; he's hallucinating bc he needs attention, he just needs more self awareness and responsibility basically. I'd rather not go back to her... but I also don't want a doctor who just throws those hard medications at him and wishes us luck. 

I just don't know what to do now.",parenting
16 month old always wants attention- is this my fault?,"My husband and I got in an argument yesterday. He wanted to sit down and watch a movie, thinking that we should be able to rest and enjoy our Sunday off. Our 16 month old was not having it. She hates it when we lay around the house and do not pay attention to her or play with her. My husband kept telling her 'if you keep crying, you're going in your crib.' Each time she would cry loudly for a while, he'd put her in her crib where she would still cry. I let him do this 3 times before I had had enough. I went in there to get her, upset at the whole situation. He then got mad at me for trying to make him feel guilty (when I got up to get her I was huffing about it and he could tell I was upset). He claims that me constantly coddling her and playing with her has not encouraged her to play by herself and she needs to learn to do this. Is this my fault? Do I need to ignore her so she will let us do our own thing? This is my first child (his second), and I just assumed this is what it meant to be a parent- constantly looking after your child and trying to make sure he/she doesn't cry all the time. I don't know. He made me feel like a bad mom, or at least a bad wife for giving him a guilt trip for not parenting the way I do. Any advice/suggestions/information?",parenting

3 YO with very specific nightmares,"For the past year or so we've been trying to get our now almost 4 year old to sleep in his own bed. Our dynamic for the year has been I put him in his bed and I lay on the guest bed in his room until he falls asleep, then I sneak back to my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going OK for the most part until the last couple of weeks. I had a talk to him about why he isn't staying in bed and keeps trying to come into mom and dads. He says he keeps having the same dream, I asked him to tell me about it, this is what he said:

&amp;#x200B;

""After I fall asleep I have a dream about a little girl underneath the other (guest) bed. She says ""Jett, help me, help me!"". She has blood coming out of her eyes and nose and ears. I want to help her but I know it's a trick because she's really a monster or ghost that will eat me"".

&amp;#x200B;

After that creepy story I just started asking a few questions to see if he was making it up. What'd she look like etc, there was absolutely no hesitation on his side. ""She had yellow hair, green eyes and she was 3 or 4 like me. Probably 4 because she speaks better than I do. If I ignore her she says ""Jett you didn't help me now the monster is eating me!"" except her voice changes and gets like this (lowers his register as low as he possibly can, sounds creepy as hell).

&amp;#x200B;

I could tell that he was genuinely terrified. I've been sleeping in his room since he told me that story and that seems to help him sleep. However my wife is getting annoyed at me and thinks our son is manipulating me, also my back is killing me from the crappy guest bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what advice I'm asking for... maybe how long should I give it until I start leaving him alone at night? Should I ask if he is still having his creepy dream or just not mention it? I'm worried if I bring it up he'll think about it and start having the nightmare again.",parenting

Seeking cooking advice to make more quality time with my stepson,"Hi all, I (33m) am our family's main cook and I can't seem to make enough time to connect with my 3yo stepson on weeknights. I try to find quick, somewhat healthy, and affordable meals to make but the ""quick"" part is difficult to manage. Because of our 5mo daughter he doesn't get as much attention as he needs. Since we have 2 daycare bills now we can't afford to eat out very often. I have an instant pot, convection toaster oven, gas stove and oven.

A typical weeknight goes something like this: pick up kids or get home a little earlier than my wife and kids, help them get into the house, turn on a cartoon for my stepson, start cooking, we eat, then he plays for a little bit while we do dishes or clean up. Then we go to his room to read him books before bed.

Does someone here have advice for quick meals? How do you manage to make time to spend with your little ones during the week?

--- Answers ---

1. Involve your children in cooking as you and they are willing or able. Examples: mixing, seasoning, pulling leaves off herbs, straining, pushing buttons (especially on the microwave), tasting, pouring. It helps to have stainless steel and lightweight mixing bowls and ramekins. Don’t let them handle sharp objects (not even a peeler) or raw meat. 

2. Double a dinner recipe, and freeze half for later in the week or following weeks.

3. Chop certain veggies before the day you cook, like onions or bell pepper.

4. Cook meat and use it for multiple meals the same week. Examples: shredded chicken or ground beef.

5. If you have time, prep and / or cook on Sunday for a portion of the week.

6. Clean and do dishes after they go to bed.

7. If a recipe is freezer-safe after cooking, then cook it on a weekend and freeze portions for the week ahead.

8. Find slow cooker or pressure cooker meals, which don’t usually require constant monitoring.",parenting
To do or not to do- taking the 16 month old on vacation.,"We booked a two week long vacation to a country that’s 16 hours away via plane (first leg is 14.5 hours). We got her a seat and she’s been well behaved on planes in general so not worried about that. However we booked this flight when she was 9mos old and she’s changed significantly since then. Is very active, can’t be contained etc. 


Our destination is popular for hiking and adventure and in addition involves a significant amount of driving to get from point A to B. We can manage given we planned for 2 weeks. However I’m starting to wonder if it will be a vacation for us? She seems more opinionated about food, activities etc so i doubt she will enjoy being in a hiking backpack or 3 hour drives every other day.


We do have an option of leaving her with grandparents and nanny (with a hefty change fee but will likely make it up with the savings in accommodation due to shorter trip) at our house for a condensed version of the same trip (9 days) when she’s 20 months old.


We keep going back and forth on pros and cons. She’s never been without either of us her entire life for days at a time. She is, however extremely attached to my mother when she’s around and very comfortable with the nanny who takes care of her during the day on weekdays and sometimes watches her when we do date nights. 


On one hand, I think we will miss her a lot during the trip and worried about her being sad the whole time. On the other, it seems like she will be the central focus throughout the trip if we do take her.


Please share any relevant experiences and help my husband and I with making a decision! Thank you in advance, r/parenting.",parenting

My kids (5m, 3.5m) are in full day kinder and half day prek. My husband (36m) works a busy fulltime job. Here's my issue right now, I feel so guilty and tired of sharing my time and giving up things I need. Early mornings are often crashed by someone getting up and starting the AM freakout about various breakfast foods and asking me to play therefore making me feel like the biggest a\*\*hole who doesn't deserve what she has.

My husband is not really great at supporting me with school. Do I really have much to complain about? Nope. But we are a small family with a handful of friends that I can ask for help sometimes. I don't really view him as a strong helper when I need someone to take the reins so I can succeed in my classes. Saturday I did schedule like 5am to 11am for myself to park it at a coffee shop and study, but they just watched TV all AM and I had to manage the restless energy the rest of the day.

 I feel resentful toward him and his 10 hour daily shifts void of guilt or worrying about other people's emotions or anything. This is not healthy and I have to shake it off. 

I sometimes feel like a jerk because I'm always uptight and desperately defensive of my time. I hate having to stay up til 1 or 2 am because I have to be president of daily life.

Night torture,"Does this sound familiar to anyone?

On September 29th my almost 3 year old learned how to climb out of his crib. Since then our nighttime has literally been hell. He would get up out of bed TONS of times throughout the night. We counted 30+ one night. You put him down not saying anything, walk away and as soon as you close the door he springs up screaming and runs to the door.

As of 3 nights ago we started locking him in his room and letting him cry it out. It’s better in the sense that he can’t get out of his room but he wakes up every night at 11, 2 and 4 crying for like an hour each time. I’m hoping this stops because we’ve had to rearrange everything, we had to move our 9 month old downstairs to sleep in the playroom and we go to bed at 7pm with the kids to get sleep and because we can’t go anywhere in the house without them hearing us. I just want to know how much longer will this persist?

Anyone had anything like this happen to them? 
Any advice? He is definitely a strong willed kid

Toddler crying at bedtime,"So my 2.5 year old daughter has always been the best sleeper. Has been falling asleep by herself without a peep since she was about a year old. A few weeks ago we switched her to a big girl bed and shes been super happy.

The last few days however, at bedtime, she is more than happy to climb in bed, lay down and settle. Cuddles her blanket and her eyes do this tired roll back. She looks like she will pass out any second. A few seconds after I leave the room however, she starts crying. Long whiny type cries. The second I open the door, shes quiet. Ive tried going in and soothing her repeatedly but I can do that for an hour to two hours straight and she wont go to sleep. If I leave her and let her cry she takes about 10-30 mins to fall asleep. 

But that really hurts my heart. Ive also tried staying in her room until she falls asleep but if Im in there shes wide awake and doesn’t even try to sleep. Last time I laid with her for an hour and nothing. I keep her awake. 

More info: she has always slept in the room pitch black with no nightlight, recently likes the fan on because its summer and its hot (yay Southern Hemisphere). Being raised bilingual so her speech isn’t at the same level as monolingual kids (I’ve been assured this is normal). Basically she understands everything fine but can’t always tell me verbally what is wrong which in this case especially is frustrating. 

Anyone have any advice? Or has had toddlers do the same thing but you were able to figure out what was wrong?",parenting
Proud of my son,"My wife and I have 2 beautiful boys: 5 and 3. We always described our 5 year old (nickname is Stew) as being an old man trapped in a kids body. He’s so funny, witty, mature.

He and I love playing board games before he goes to bed and he’s recently learned chess. The only problem is that he loses it if he loses a match...which happens half the time. I let him win/I beat him. Upset, angry, etc. I get it’s right before bedtime so we cut Stew some slack but wifey and I still emphasize that it’s only a game and that you’re not always going to win, you have to learn how to lose and still be a good sport.

Tonight, I actually decided to try and win the match fast because wife wanted him upstairs for a bath. So I played to my fullest. 

I can’t get over how well he played, even with me trying. He was up 1 piece halfway through, almost trapped my queen, was thinking ahead, etc. I thought he was going to win in parts of it. I’m so proud of him.

I eventually won and this time he didn’t get mad...he just shook my hand and said good game.

I stopped loving my child,"I’ve never admitted to this and it’s going to paint a picture of a real shit mom hence the throwaway.

I think at some point I stopped loving my son and it is eating me up and hurting my ability to be there for him.

Background: I had my son at 18. I was a single parent, fresh out of rehab (I was an “unruly teen”), and his dad was not in the picture. So not ideal. At first, I had no problem emotionally bonding with him, I loved having a child even if unplanned and I adored every single thing he did no matter how small.... buuutt I also had a raging alcohol problem that started when he was around 2. I managed to function somewhat -going to school, working full time, raising him. But I prioritized alcohol over a lot of things, like being emotionally stable for him and spending real quality time together (ie playing on the floor vs buying him meaningless material objects out of guilt)

When he was around 5 something switched.

I remember when I felt as if he lost his baby smell, when he became a boy and not a toddler, when I started to feel almost a repulsion and uncomfortableness at the physical cuddling I once loved. I began to fixate on his mistakes and feel anger and annoyance towards him. He has a difficult time doing some basic tasks which worsens my annoyance (I was showing him to open a trash bag the other day), but i think because I was an alcoholic for years meant I wasn’t teaching him what a parent should have been so I have to make up for it now. It just adds to my frustration because I get even more impatient even though this is MY fault. In summary, the only way I can adequately describe it is I didn’t love him the same and I haven’t since.

He is 11 now, and while I’ve been there for him on a superficial it is forced and I am just checking the boxes (several hugs and ‘I love you’s a day, check, homemade healthy meals, check, after school activities, check, whatever clothes he’s into, check, weekend trips to the beach, check etc). I don’t know what happened but I obviously a lot of guilt over this. 

I have a 4 year old daughter now and the feelings I have towards them are night and day. He has mentioned awhile back how my daughter is the favorite — even a few outside people have made comments, but I was drinking so as addiction goes that was #1 and I neglected this issue. He stopped mentioning it, not because it’s gone, but because he’s resigned to the fact that this is the dynamic.

I have almost a year of sobriety now. I know I probably need in person therapy about this (especially since I have real issues with men stemming from sexual abuse as a teen) but as we are on a sabbatical in a foreign country for a year and therapy is hard to find —- I’m so desperate for advice and suggestions so please just lay it on me.

Separation with no custody agreement yet. Is the co parent allowed to be super dunk at drop off?,"My ex and I were together for 7 years and broke up about 6 months ago. My ex is an active alcoholic with a dui and admitted to using and hiding meth from me for our entire relationship. I try to keep things nice between us and help give him rides and take our kid to see him. He isnt working much and is working under the table and has givin me maybe 100 the last 4 months but still seems to be able to go drinking all the time. I have held off on getting courts involved so he can get his shit together because apparently it makes it harder for him to get his license back until the next few months when his dui probation is over so i havent been able to get on foodstamps or have much help and pay for all her things on my own. Anyways, he finally got moved in with his friends who are a couple with 3 kids. I was excited and nervous to finally bring our daughter (6) over for her first sleep over at his new house and when i got there all the adults were piss drunk, like barely stand straight drunk. I didnt feel comfortable leaving her there and so I hung around and watched a movie or two with them .T heir kids went with their grandparent for a few hours and it was just us adults and our kid. All the adults passed out and after an hour I just ended up taking our daughter home after trying to wake up her dad because I had to go and it was late with no sign of him waking up to feed her or do anything with her. I am just super depressed that he couldnt stay sober one day or even stay awake with the limited time he had with our daughter and now that he woke up 2 hours after we went home and i got our child fed and in bed he is calling me demanding I bring her back.  I wanted her to be there, I wanted her to have a good time with her dad and he is telling me I dont get to decide what he does with his time because he never gets to see her.  I didnt feel safe leaving her there by herself somewhere she had never stayed before in a house of drunk adults. Usually when her dad drinks he sleeps for along time and you cant wake him up and if he does wake up its just to start drinking more. Was I wrong and do I have to leave her with a bunch of drunk adults, I just feel like a negligent parent leaving her with people who are not able to take care of her.",parenting

Melatonin for a 2 year old?,"Hello. 

My daughter is a month shy of 2 years old (she's a big 2 year old too, 100th percentile in all categories). She was an ""ok"" sleeper from 6 to 18 months. 

She has no problem going to sleep to start the night, however, for the past month and a half, she has been waking up more and more at night and even earlier in the mornings fully awake (like 4am-ish). We even moved her bedtime back to 8:30ish to see if she'll make it to 6 am but no luck. What's even worse is that for the past 3 nights she's been waking up every up every hour. 

My pregnant wife and myself cannot deal with this anymore since we have a 3rd child due in February. We (especially my pregnant wife), need to get our rest too. Luckily our 7 year old son can sleep through a hurricane (He himself had to take melatonin at age 4 because he was having trouble getting to sleep).

Is there a children's melatonin or sleep aid that's ok to give to a 2 year old?

I feel like I won the parenting lottery today.,"3yo(m) is notoriously hard to take into public places. He is on the spectrum and has always struggled with shopping for numerous reasons. Mostly sensory overload, and not understanding why we are there and not doing what he wants to  be doing.
We have been working so.so.hard with his therapists to develop a ""shopping routine"" and give him lots of prior warning before shopping trips. It usually only helps him cope with the first 5 mins of a trip though, so we generally do as many errands as we can when he is at preschool or with a family member.

But for 2 days in a row now he has come out to the shops with us as a bare necessity - once to a place where he normally can't even bear to walk through the door, and once to a grocery shop that isn't our regular. Both times he was perfect. He happily sat in the trolley and helped pick new clothes (sudden growth spurt), and today walked through the grocery store with nary even a slight complaint about being there. 

I'm normally terrified to take him places as I don't know how he will react. He has scratched at my eyes and bruised me while having fits at those exact shops in the past. But he managed them! And was still happy and relaxed even once we got home. I've cried so many tears of joy today that all the things we have been working on with him may finally be helping him cope and feel more confident in public. It's a huge step for him.
Felt it was worth sharing for all the other parents out there who feel like they're not getting anywhere with their preschoolers, whether on the spectrum or not. Progress and come all at once and it feels like the lottery!",parenting
How to tell my son that his close friend's mother died?,"There are so many of these posts on here that give excellent advice about this, but I just can't think straight enough to search out the right one for this situation.

For the last 2 1/2 years he has made my life hell. Started smoking, getting in trouble at school. Then the last 8 months he has been stealing. It started with taking stuff from his family. Now its our neighbor's. I have tried punishment after punishment. We have tried getting him into counseling. Our neighbors can't prove it was him but I believe them. If he has been taking from us It's not much of a stretch to think he is responsible for their items also. Never anything big but still still stealing is stealing and a crime. It's killing me because he is mad I don't believe it wasn't him. They have photos of a young guy coming onto their properties. You can never see a face but the build of the kid is the same as my son.

How do I tell my mom to stop talking about my daughters weight?,"A little background, I'm a 45 year old mom. I have typical baby boomer parents who probably border on emotionally abusive. My brother and I both had weight problems. I can't figure out all the why's and how's. There was a very weird dynamic in my home. My mother definitely used food to show love, but then as we put on weight we were shamed etc. My mom took my brother to WW at 11. All kinds of messed up stuff regarding body image and weight. Tons of mean, heartless comments. Neither of my parents are overweight.

So now I have 2 daughters age 13 and 7. My 13 year old is very bony, tiny and actually underweight. She is not unhealthy, just one of those people that can eat tons of food and not gain weight. My 7 year old has a more sturdy build. She is at a healthy weight for her height and is not overweight, but looks different to her sister. My mom has started making comments that my youngest is going to have to watch her weight etc. My parents are coming to visit in 2 weeks and I'm worried about them constantly talking to my daughters about weight and shaming my younger daughter when she wants to eat.

She is two years old we just now started sleep training her a couple weeks ago.

I believe that if our kid sleeps in our bed, everytime she wakes up crying and my wife is always there to comfort her will not have to skills to soothe herself.

Huge gap between school misbehavior and at-home discipline?,"The tl;dr question is, how effective is it to ""discipline"" a 5 year old at home for misbehavior at school, many hours after the noted problem?   
My son is 5 and has mild/HF autism. Obviously we do not ""discipline"" for autism-specific things he cannot help and we stress to him that his feelings are always legitimate. However, we also teach that rude behavior is inappropriate. If my son is rude and shouts at us at home, we put him in a time-out for him to calm down. Then we talk about the mistake. He always is remorseful and says he understands. So over all, behavior at home is good. He never throws, hits, calls names, etc. His big reaction is just to shout and maybe stomp his feet and have rude expressions, etc. 

School, though, is a totally different story. His recall is not great but we get daily communication from his para. Apparently he is shouting multiple times a day, in class. It also escalates because the para is unable to really help him (due to her inexperience) and she just takes him outside the class to a different teacher. Obviously the stressors are bigger at school compared to home and his neurology is not going to be as flexible as typical kids. But we are pretty shocked and sad at this news and don't know how to address it at home.   
   
When he comes home from school, he is usually all smiles and happy to play. We talk about the school day after he has settled in and he is always embarrassed and remorseful about his misbehavior. He intellectually understands that shouting is wrong, even if he is mad, but it does not translate to his school day. 

I know some parents punish their kids at home for what happens at school but I don't know if 1. this would be effective for a 5 year old or 2. this would be effective given that he is deterred at home for the same issue but not at school. 

Would love insight and advice.",parenting
My daughter's new haircut,"A little while back, my 9 yo daughter wanted a very short hair cut.  It was fine with me but she can be pretty sensitive and I was worried about kids at school potentially picking on her for having ""boy hair"".  I remember school being hell when I was a kid.  I was picked on constantly for everything (cloths, hair, facial features, family members, height, weight, parents' cars, shoes, etc.). I didn't want my daughter to go through that if she didn't have to.  

I was torn.  If I warned her, she might not choose the style she wanted and I didn't want that.  I want her to be herself.  Then again, she might end up being miserable for months/years until it grows out again if I didn't say something.  

In the end I said nothing. Weeks went by and she seemed fine.  I thought I had worried for no reason.  One day, I casually asked if anyone said anything about her hair, and to my surprise, some kids DID make fun of her hair cut.  She said it didn't really bother her because she just ignored them. 

I was so proud of her.  I realized she was a lot tougher, more mature and brave than I had initially given her credit for.  I wish I could have been like her when I was a kid.",parenting
19 month old sleep help,"My youngest is 19 months. For 19 months I have slept in 2-3 hour chunks. She has never not woken up at least 3 times a night....usually more like 5 or 6. I’m exhausted. I’m a high school teacher and my job is so demanding....I feel like I am barely surviving. 

We have 5 year old who was also a terrible sleeper until 16 months and then became an incredible sleeper....I was holding on to that with my second, and now that we are at 19 months without improvement, I’m feeling pretty defeated.

We weren’t into sleep training, but also have now tried several  methods. My kids are stubborn and strong willed and it doesn’t work. 

We really can’t afford a sleep consultant, though I’m wondering if that is the only option left....I really feel like we have exhausted (ha) all options. 

Maybe you have a suggestion we haven’t tried/thought of?

She currently sleeps on a floor bed and shares a room with her older sister (somehow they don’t disrupt each other). She ends up in my bed by 11pm usually. 

I should also add- she is a daytime joy. You would have no idea what a terrible sleeper she is...doesn’t seem to be affecting her at all. Just me. And my marriage.",parenting
Birthday presents for mom,"Today is my birthday. I was taking advantage of the fact that it's Sunday to sleep in. My kids were not. There were lots of little noises that I ignored because hey, weekend.

Then youngest, 7, came in to my soon and jumped into bed with me. He said, ""I'm supposed to keep you in bed because your present isn't ready yet."" The other two immediately started scolding him because it was supposed to be a surprise!

Naturally, that was the end of me trying to sleep. They made a banner for my door, wrote a bunch of jokes on papers, and made me a breakfast of a glass of milk, a cartoon of yogurt, and a baggie of granola.

I exclaimed over the banner, laughed at the jokes, ate the breakfast, and cleaned up the mess they made.

I'm at the end of my rope with my stepdaughter (5) and not sure where to go,"It has been over a year since we've gone 24 hours without her just completely destroying something. As an example, at some point this morning she went into the 2yos room, dumped every, single drawer of folded clothes and shoes, dumped the toy box, then shoved things randomly everywhere (drawers in the toy box, shoes shoved into hanging shirts, underwear shoved under his pillow, etc). Last week, she took her sister's favorite doll dress and cut it to strips with the only explanation being ""I was playing."" That's what she claims, always. I have constant anxiety opening doors because I never know what's going to be on the other side.

It seems like we've tried everything. It doesn't matter how well she eats, how much exercise she gets, how much one on one attention she gets, or what the consequences are (picking up, time out, apologizing, figuring out how to make amends, etc), it doesn't change anything. You can watch her, eyes directly on her, the entire day, but when she slips off to the bathroom, now there's TP and water everywhere, toothbrushes on the floor, mousse on the mirror, etc. Her mom had her tested for autism, deafness, blindness, ADD/ADHD, and everything came back negative. While we do suspect she might have an auditory processing disorder (too young to diagnose, but we just use the same tricks anyway, it's about the only way to get a result), this is just insane.

I don't even know what to do anymore, but I can't keep living with the anxiety of an explosion behind every door. We know part of the issue is that she has no supervision at her mom's house, which is probably 25-30% of her time. I have no control over that and yes I realize it's a big factor, but we're going to have to figure out how to work around it. 

I guess I'm hoping for suggestions? I'm not sure. I've done so much research over the last few years in dealing with ""spirited"" children, but you never know where your blind spots are. I'm just so damn frustrated, and I feel terrible for our other kids because they're doing the right things but basically end up punished when we have to wait for 5yo to clean up her insane mess before we go, etc.",parenting
Preference for mommy - what's normal and what's not? (11 month old),"My daughter turns one year old in about three weeks, and I feel like I'm starting to approach my breaking point with her.  From day one, she's pretty much preferred Mom, which I understand is mostly normal for babies.  I'm not equipped for one of the crucial needs she has, after all.  I've tried hard to be a loving father for her.  One of the reasons I subscribe to this subreddit to begin with is to see what issues other families have when the father is absent, or approaches the family life with a sexist mindset of ""the housework and the baby are mom's responsibility.""  I try to see what other men are doing wrong so that I'm not making the same mistakes.  

I try to be involved.  I try to bottle feed her, I change dirty diapers, I hold her and play with her, I'm supportive and encouraging, I try to make her laugh (this too comes so much more easily for my wife)...but she still prefers Mom.  I don't ever yell at her, I don't spank her, I'm not doing anything even remotely abusive.  

Some good examples: I just tried to feed her a bottle of formula, and she drank half an ounce and then pushed away.  She started to get fussy, so Mom comes and gets her, and she proceeds to drink most of the rest of the bottle.  

I'll hold her, but she'll push me away.  Often, she pushes off me so hard that I pretty much immediately have to put her down.

She'll wake up in the middle of the night and cry.  I'll get up and pick her up and try to soothe her, but this only makes her cry harder and Mom has to come save me.  She'll stop crying usually within a few minutes of being with Mom.

It's starting to feel like this isn't a phase.  And it's starting to cause depression for me I think.

I know that babies have an innate preference for their mothers, but what is normal and what's excessive?",parenting
Question for parents of kids in elementary school,"Hi everyone!

I'm a first time mom and have a 2 month newborn. I have PPD and currently going through the works of getting it treated (therapy and meds). I can't afford a full time nanny and my parents or in-laws don't live near me. In fact, we moved countries two months before birth so no friend support either. Yes - if I had a time capsule I would either have not had a kid or at the least, not moved countries.

Its all happened however - but here's a question for parents down the line. When do you think having kids is worth it and when does a life with kids begin to feel better than a life before kids? (Note that I said before and not without which means if you had a time capsule, would you go back to being kid-free and only you and your spouse?)

I'm terribly unhappy - and at times feel entirely stuck. I plan to return immediately to work and move to a country where help is affordable and we are closer to family. I do hope this dark phase of my life leaves me and I can feel that having a child has truly added to my life.",parenting

Need Help with Sons Addicted to Xbox,"So I have two boys 8 and 6 that are highly addicted to  Xbox, Netflix, TV. I thought it was a good idea acouple years ago to buy a Xbox for them as I had one as a kid. Give them something in common with other kids in school. However Minecraft and the like are taking over their life. I was a bit more responsible with homework and then playing video games on days with bad weather, etc. I feel like my kids are just addicted to TV, Netflix, and Xbox. I have been trying to teach them how to ride a bike and they show zero interest in learning. They get frustrated and give up trying. I wish I never bought the Xbox and wish I can throw the TV away. I don’t ever get to watch tv so what’s the point. They throw a fit when it’s homework time... and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I am overwhelming them with homework... however I have been on their case with school work as they are not progressing as I feel they should. I know it’s not just all work and no play. I am all for a healthy balance... but I don’t know what I am doing wrong and can’t handle the temper tantrums and the pulling of teeth to get homework done. I have to deal with 45 minutes of tantrums for 10 minutes worth of work. I’ve tried everything and I’m lost.

Proud Mommy Moment,"From the time LO (now 2 months) was about 2-3 weeks old I decided to start teaching her baby sign language. I hoped it would help her to communicate with me so I could meet her needs more easily.

One of the signs I've been teaching her is for ""diaper change"". I make the sign with my hands in front of her while saying it, then put her hands together to do the same sign. Then I change her diaper.  I've been doing this for the past month.  Last night, my husband and I are sitting on the floor watching her play in her little play gym when she just stops what she's doing, rolls to face us and she starts signing for a diaper change! I was shocked! My husband wanted to see if she really was signing for a diaper change and went to check her diaper. Yep, she needed a change!

The mum hardly spends time with the baby and I have to beg her to take her so I can remain mentally sane,"Every day she has an excuse to not spend no more than 3 hours with the baby.... I WAKE up at 5am, midnight, 8am.... Then around 10-12 mum might wake up and take her while I do a little sleep - Mostly in that time the baby is napping
then quickly the baby is back to me

Today it so happens her friend is here whom she sees weekly (mostly goes to sleep at her house at least once a week)  
So her excuse is “i want to take my friend to town for few hours” - bear in mind they were out in town yesterday from 3pm until almost 1am

I asked how long will you be gone because I’m dying here with the baby (she’s being extremely difficulty) she was reluctant to say
I pressed saying I can’t be stuck with the baby it’s really difficult I’m struggling, you see your friend every week.... Then suddenly she drops how my family are shitty and it would be the same if they weren’t so shitty

But the fffffffing difference is she ALWAYS has an excuse and quite literally I NEVER make excuses and just push through caring for the baby EVERY DAY

Behavior Expectations of Parents at Children’s Sporting Events? When does bad behavior require consequences ?,"What is your opinion if a parent is yelling at players, disrupting a game to the point it must be stopped and UIL Rules are read over a loud speaker, an Official is told they do not know the rules of the game security is called in but the parent is not escorted out? Oh and a fight broke out with this parent in the stands and he screamed cuss words at another parent that told him to calm down and as he was being dragged out of the gym by another parent, he decided to flip the double bird into the crowd. All this happened at my daughters 7th grade volleyball game Wednesday night.

The parent down played the whole incident and no one videoed. This parent told the school he would not attend the next game but would like to attend the district tournament the following week. 

What are your thoughts on this? Seems like he is telling the school what he wants to do instead of the school telling him what he is going to do.",parenting
13 yo daughter wants a buzzcut.,"my 13 year old daughter has requested that she wants a buzz cut. She suffers from bad anxiety and often pulls on  her hair a lot when she gets stressed so she asked if she could just get it all cut off and start a new page, talking about how this is her decision solely. 

I’m not sure whether I should let her get it or not. She is homeschooled and won’t get bullied, but i’m just afraid she will regret it and feel insecure. 

She said she has been thinking about it for a while and is sure. She said if worse comes to worse she can just buy herself a cheap wig. 

I’m not sure what I should do in this situation, as i’m worried she will feel insecure but even more worried about how not doing this may affect her anxiety.

Advice on what I should do would be really helpful, thank you :)

Advice Needed: Daughter not talking consistently at 21 months,"Hello r/parenting, I'm a first time father at 29 raising a beautiful baby girl. I'm a bit worried about her language development as she is still not talking at 21 months old, however I'm fairly certain she can understand me and is absorbing information about new words.

Some things about our family

* There are 2 languages in our household
* My daughter started walking early, I think around 6 months
* My daughter will say words a few times then stop using them. For example, when she was younger she would say mama and dada a lot and barely says them anymore. She kept saying 'octopus' a few days ago (its from one of her books) and hasn't said it since. She learned how to say 'wawa' for water about 6 months ago and then stopped saying it.
* She can understand if I'm asking her for something, such as 'Can I have the pink ball?', or 'Can I have a hug?'
* The only word she uses consistently is 'Up' for when she wants to be picked up

I'm thinking about making an appointment with a pediatrician  to talk about her speech. Should I wait it out and see what happens or take my daughter to the doctor?

How do you handle depression?,"To preface, I love my kid more than anything. He's been the best thing to have happened to my boring self. And I'd like to give him the perfect life with all the happiness he can think of. Literally anything. But..... 

I'm tired, always uninterested, tired, sad, tired again....you get the idea. And he's old enough to notice me doing the antics and won't be long before he questions or accepts why I don't play or am overall really shitty parent. I would dodge by saying maybe he understands, but I don't want him to. His childhood shouldn't suffer because I cannot be there for him when he's always there and wnats me to be there too.

And then comes the fear of what tomorrow may bring. What happens to him because I couldn't provided him the opportunities that would enable him to have a normal life the kids he's going to see tomorrow have?

Is there like a cheatcode or some daily regimen that people who're depressed follow to not affect their kids? Or do they just ignore being such?

I’m at my wits end over these messy rooms.,"I have a 13 year old girl and a 10 year old girl who each have their own rooms. In the past year or so, they have become increasingly lazy when it comes to cleaning their rooms. Some days I’d get so exasperated, I would thoroughly clean them myself because I’m a little bit of a neat freak. I just really loathe clutter. They don’t have an over abundance of clothes/toys/personal items. There plenty of storage/space for everything to have its own place. I’d clean their rooms and have them help so they know how it should look, only to have them looking like a rats nest a day or two later. Literally! Piles of clothes not hung up after I wash and fold (all they have to do is put the clothes away), or food wrappers found in odd places, cups from downstairs left on dressers, my  13 year old’s makeup unorganized even though I bought her drawers and shelves specifically for that stuff. 

I’ve tried taking away electronics, denying after school activities (no hanging out with friends), no TV, etc. I just don’t know what to do! I don’t make threats and I don’t use physical punishment. Grounding doesn’t work either. 

I’m on the verge of literally emptying their rooms and putting it all away in storage and leaving them with one pair of clothes for the whole week until they keep their rooms clean. (That’s cruel, I know. I’d never do that but you get my annoyed desperation.) I wasn’t raised that way and I don’t live like that so I’m not leading by example by having a dirty/cluttered house/bedroom. I know they do the same thing when they go to visit their father every other weekend. I’ve conveyed this to him but he isn’t doing anything to support my concern.

Update: How to tell daughter about murder-suicide,"Thank you so so much to every single person who gave advice or shared your experiences. I didn't reply to very many of you because I was feeling overwhelmed by the topic too but I read every single comment.

I had my daughter join me for a walk outside (if you didn't read the thread you can find it in my post history and look at the top comment - the top comment is why I had us go outside). I kept in mind a mixture of all the comments.

I told her that I had really hard news to tell her and asked if she wanted to hold hands when I told her, because it was horrible news. She did want to hold hands, so we did. 

I told her that her friend Julia, and all Julia's family, had died. 

I told her that it was such a bad situation that it was in the news and I said I would like to tell her the basic fact of how it happened since it would really suck to see it in the newspaper or learn about it online first, since she'd probably eventually hear about it in some form online. I asked if she agreed about that. She said she did.

So I told her that Julia's father was mentally ill in a very, very unusual way. A way that doesn't mean anything about most mentally ill people at all, and I pointed out that she and I both know people with mental illnesses who we know are really kind and wouldn't do anything to anyone. But that nobody who's happy and well-adjusted ever does what Julia's father did, so that's why I mentioned mental illness. And what Julia's father did was shoot Julia, Julia's siblings, and Julia's mother before himself.

I admit I started crying and then when I cried my daughter also started crying.

I'm pretty honest with my daughter so when we were both breathing normally again and not sobbing our guts out I said that I was sorry to have to tell her such horrific news. I said any way she mourns, any way at all, is normal. Being stoic, crying a lot, wanting to talk, not wanting to talk... finding it hard to concentrate on other things or concentrating  more on other things... anything. I told her absolutely every way a person could possibly react is still normal.

I also told her therapy has helped me deal with emotionally hard things and that if she wants to go to a therapist who's very good at helping people who are grieving, I would immediately make her an appointment with that sort of therapist.

She said she wanted to talk about it more again when we went back inside, with my husband, but then not talk about it again with us until/unless she asks us to talk about it more. She also said she wanted to talk about it with her health teacher before deciding about a therapist because she thinks her health teacher is very helpful and she's already talked to her health teacher about emotional things. I said that was a good idea to talk to a teacher she trusts. I also said I bet her health teacher already knew about it, because my daughter seemed confused about how to tell someone what happened. I told her I'd also been confused about how to tell someone what happened, so confused and scared I'd asked for advice. (You guys.) 

I asked if she wanted to ask my husband/her step-dad to come outside too since going on walks can make talking easier and she said no, she wanted to talk on the couch. The three of us talked about it like that. Not about details of the event. Just about how miserable the event made us. She and I cried some more. 

The person who said your son's friend died and it turns out your son was much closer to that friend than you realized - I remembered that and it turns out that was true here too.

I don't know. It's been tough since then but I think we are doing well considering how horrible the situation is. I think I did okay. She's wanted infinite hugs and she's also needed a lot of time with us before she goes to bed. About an hour of sitting in her room and talking (about stuff that isn't THIS). Then she can sleep. 

I guess we'll see how it goes from here.",parenting
4 year old having a hard time with baby gate,"Recently, our 7 month old has decided the stairs are the next best thing, so we've had to bring out the old baby gate. We knew our 4 year old would be unhappy about this, but baby's safety kinda trumps 4yos independence for the time being. 

Our house does not have a bathroom on the main floor (only one is upstairs... It's annoying as hell). So when 4yo has to use the bathroom (or wants to grab something from her room upstairs), she has to ask us to open the gate. We've tried teaching her how to open the gate, but she doesn't have the strength in her upper body and hands to do it. 

Has anyone experienced this issue before and found a baby gate that a preschooler can open themselves? Any product recommendations are welcome. We currently have the munchkin auto close:

My 8 year old and bf are not getting along.,"My bf moved into our home about 3 years ago. My ex does not provide anything for my daughter and only sees her about 2 days a month, when he showers her with gifts and junk food. When my daughter gets home she is cold to my bf, usually taking a few days to warm up to him again. Lately, my daughter has become argumentative, not just with my bf but he does get the most of it. She will disagree just to disagree, interrupts, and is just very dismissive with him. I correct her behaviors when she is rude and remind her of her manners. My bf takes this personally, sometimes letting it go but sometimes it comes to a head and he will respond with anger which never ends well. I feel stuck in the middle. My daughter is a good kid, I have always considered her very easy to deal with as she is receptive to conversations about her behaviors. But this one I am lost with. I know she loves my bf, she shows him love like children do- with drawings and hugs and playfulness. But this week we took a vacation together and I felt like I was a constant referee. Trying to make sure she was on her best behavior so that I didn't have to hear about it from my bf. I feel like he should ignore her behavior toward him but I don't know if that's right. I don't know if it's a phase that she will outgrow but I know it's putting a strain on our relationship.",parenting
Questioning myself if I did enough re: high school entrance exam,"Yesterday, my middle daughter took an entrance exam to an elite high school in our area. I was fairly content then. She studied once a week since last year. She would skip days and I let her. I didn't pressure her to study and just gave her reminders for the exam. To make it short, it was more of a casual review for an entrance exam, not an extensive type must-pass review.

The second other students arrived though, I was surprised. It felt like we arrived at a professional license exam rather than an entrance exam. There were teachers giving last minute tips. There are students with some last minute study papers. It really felt like they were about to go into war with their mind as their weapon. I half-expected drums to sound off from a distance. When they fell in line to go to the examination area, their teacher shouted, ""Ready?"" And they replied in unison, ""Ready!"" You can tell they've been extensively preparing for this for months!

Oh my God. I questioned myself. Did I just fail to support my child educationally? Because all the others were so ready. A lot of them also finished the exams early. Many said it was easy and that after seeing the questions, they are now sure they will pass. My daughter said Science and Math weren't easy for her.

Can we discuss this without it being taboo?,"Trigger warning: Mentions of female bodily fluids, mildly gorish reference to periods, natural miscarriage.

Right now I'm going through a miscarriage it started 9/30 and I figured it was a normal period. It got real this past Tuesday (10/8) bleeding was bad, worse than when I had my second (first live birth ended in life support decisions for brain death) based on things I saw (passed tissue / fetus) and was told at the ER I was about 6-8 weeks along. I figured at most maybe 3 or 4. My pregnancies are not necessarily difficult but prone to not textbook symptoms. 

I have been oscillating between hormonally sad and just how do I cope what do I say to people, stoic because I want and need to support my husband and angry that everyone is handling this with kid gloves or acting like I must be okay or throwing sympathy with a dash of pity, because I'm still trying to keep on keeping on; honestly I'm stubborn as heck. I don't know how upset I'm allowed to be because so many folks rely on me keeping the house and family together it's a whole post on it's own. My husband has been super supportive and I'm trying to reciprocate and feel like I'm failing.

The weeks prior to this I had a massively stubborn headcold where getting out of bed wasn't happening (clue one that I'm probably pregnant) with daily rolling nausea (clue two). The normal OTC tests don't register positives with me for whatever reason, blood work at the ER did confirm that it was positive.

My in-laws while being supportive and picking up my slack around the house have also felt the need to inform people for me about it as they were in the room against my want; we asked they wait in the waiting room they insisted for support purposes. All I wanted was me, my husband and a change of pants. It was not a fun experience and I felt like it was more spectator sport than me getting the care I needed. Can't change the past but I now for sure what I should do if there's a next time (I hope like hell there's not) to anyone going through this right now you have my deepest sympathies.

My hormones are doing their thing so if I'm not crying, I'm feeling intensely frisky, which after reading on miscarriage is a thing. I don't even know if I'm grieving the way I need to because I am all over the damn road. Yes I'm sad, but also need to be close to my husband it's confusing but I'm working on it.

Am I allowed to cry, because we were trying for this, am I allowed to be angry that people know on someone else's terms because support? I don't want pity, I want to be able to talk about it. If I get pregnant again there will be at least an 7 / 8 year gap between my first and second child. We've been trying for a while. I'm afraid they won't be close. Should I just stop at one? There's fertility issues at play, and a csection.

I'm on bed rest for at least a week. I've got my child by myself right now because the inlaws decided to go out I must be doing okay right? Hubby is at work it's unavoidable he just doesn't have the time and I wouldn't ask because his parents are here or well they are usually. 

I don't even know what sub to post in. I just need some outside support I guess.",parenting
My partner is leaving me in the middle of an adoption.,"Me and my partner have been together for about 5 years. About 1.5 years ago, we mutually decided to foster a child. We were both excited about this. A few months ago, we agreed to proceed with adoption of the child we had been fostering since last year (9). Last week, my partner claimed he wants to leave. It was, in his words, because we have grown apart, because he feels there is a lack of connection between him and the child, and because he feels empty about the life we have. We live in the countryside, far from his family, and this, he has said, has taken a toll on him.
I questioned all of these, of course, but mostly his desire to leave an already broken child. I will admit, fostering this child has been a challenge but one that I thought we were managing well.

This is destroying me. I am a wreck. I do not want to give up on this child but I cannot do it alone. I break down every time I think about doing this by myself — it is not something I was prepared for. My partner and I had been co-parenting this kid. I will admit the child has grown closer to me, but mostly because My partner’s work schedule meant he was often out when the kid was awake. On top of this, being emotionally abandoned keeps piercing my heart.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to go on. I am a mess.",parenting
Offbeat 10th birthday ideas,"My son is not giving us any useful ideas for his birthday party with his friends. Last year we did a trampoline party. Laser tag the year before. We did a DIY Mad Science in our front yard before that. We've been to a few at Dave and Buster's. We're considering an indoor NERF tournament.

He's not really athletic, so most ""normal things (bowling, batting, etc.) have no appeal. We've looked into and ruled out:

* Autobahnspeed.com (too expensive)
* Archerytag.com (GREAT idea, but not available near me)
* Paintball (A little pricey, a little distant)
* A videogame trailer (we have no idea why he doesn't want to do this...)

Abusive mom as a grandparent,"Ok so a little background. I am married to a very supportive husband and have a vibrant, precious 2 year old son. I am a full time working mom and my husband is a stay at home dad. For the last 7 years we have lived several states away from my mother. I have just accepted a new position in my hometown (where my mom lives) after being recruited by a company that offered me a very good step up in my career. 

I am very excited about the development except for one issue. I had a very turbulent childhood due in large part to my mother’s addiction and mental health struggles. My husband and I are also recovering alcoholics with 10+ years of sobriety. So he is not totally unfamiliar with these types of issues. The problem is that I recently shared with my husband some of the traumatic memories of my childhood (for example, my mother a couple of times pretended to kill herself to see how I would react when I was 5-6 years old). 

My mother is very different now. She has mellowed a great deal, gotten significant therapy, and hasn’t used drugs for about 3 years. But my husband says he doesn’t feel comfortable allowing our son to be with my mother unattended. My mom doesn’t work, is single, and alone most of the time. She is so excited for us to come back and says she can’t wait to pick my son up, take him around town, and spoil him rotten.

I’m so anxious about all of this. It is difficult to transmit the full picture, but so much of my family’s dysfunction and family roles were tied up in me taking care of my mom, saving her from herself, not rocking the boat, keeping secrets from the outside world, etc. that I recognize my anxiety also stems from feeling like I have betrayed her by telling my husband. And fear over hurting her (lest some really bad things happen). 

I also feel guilty for contemplating allowing my son to be around her and risking his safety because it feels justified that she is different now and doing so allows me to pretend that abuse didn’t happen. But I also wonder if she should be punished for something that happened 25 years ago? Our lives and her personality are so much bigger than the one story. But on the other hand, there was more abuse than that one story too.

I just feel so scared when I think about navigating this.

Looking to see if anyone else has been there or has any advice.",parenting

How would I go about making a complaint to my child's school?,"The school are ignoring my child's epilepsy in their reports and claiming he falls asleep in class and is ""lazy"" and ""uninterested"". I've already wrote an email to the headmaster, but no action was taken, so instead I want to complain to the school governor's/ trustees. 

My son has absence seizures. When he has an absence seizure, his brain basically shuts off. He'll stare into space, stop blinking and stop breathing. It lasts anywhere from 15 seconds to a couple of minutes. He's been been diagnosed with CAE and the school are aware of his diagnosis but I still get school reports and meetings stating my son is ""falling asleep"" in class and ""daydreaming"". Obviously not day dreaming when he isn't even breathing at the time. I've explained to his teacher in meetings, but she will not listen.

Will anything happen if I make a complaint or am I wasting my time?",parenting
My 16yo son doesn't care about anything,"Hello everyone.

I'm the mother to a 16 years old boy and i'm very worried about his well being. 

He won't sign up for any activity or assiociation at his school, he tries to avoid at any cost going to friends house when he is invited, he hasn't invited a friend over at our house in years, doesn't want to participate in family stuff even when it's supposed to be fun for him (like Christmas or family parties).

He has never been a hard kid to deal with from a pragmatic point of view, he performs well in school (but I will get to that later), does his chores when asked to. He is also very calm and he generally obeys us with little to no trouble. We used to joke with my husband that there must be something wrong with him because he obeys so easily even as a teenager, but now I feel like it actually might be a manifestation of something deeper. 

On the flip side, it is incredibly hard to connect to him emotionnally or physically. He refuses any contact whether in the form of hugging, kissing or simply playing around, and he NEVER speaks about his emotions. When asked ""how is it going in school, do you get along with other kids"" he always replies with ""yes everything is fine"". It is seems impossible to get something out of him that comes from the heart.

What you should know is that he's an extremely bright kid. He was always the best in school, he knows a lot about politics and economics. He also started playing guitar at 10 and improved faster than all the other kids and then he just stopped. I feel like this is the root of the issue. He starts being interested in something, does very well at it, and then he simply loses interest and either switch to doing nothing or doing something else. I know that he recently got into programming, and was quite enthusiastic, saying that it opened a world of possibilities. But a few weeks later he dropped it saying it doens't matter anyway. And that's what he always say. He doesn't want to play the guitar anymore because it doesn't matter, he doesn't want to get involved in a politics association ( even though he does seem interested by politics ), because it doesn't matter, doesn't want to go to his friends house because it doesn't matter. He does keep his grades up but i'm convinced that it's because he know we are going to bother him otherwise, not because he actually cares about it. We proposed to offer him a trip to Europe with other kids at a summer camp, but he doens't want to. He just wants to be left alone, always. Once when he was 12, a girl offered him some pastry and a letter (apparently with a romantic intent) and he simply threw everything in the thrash, saying that he barely spoke to that girl and he doesn't know why she would be interested in him. He also forgets to wish birthday to us or his sister, and when confronted about it simply says sorry but it really doesn't feel like he actually is sorry. I already tried opening up to him and told him that I was hurting, that I didn't understand what was going on in his mind, and it breaks my heart to say it, but he really didn't seem to care. 

I wasn't really worried about all this at first because that's the way he""s always been, and his sister (21) is a happy young woman with plenty of friends, I just figured that at some point he would change, but I feel like it's only gotten worse over the years.

Me and my husband are completely lost, we don't know what to do. We are not even sure that we should do something.

Baby Gate Advice,"So here's where I'm at, my wife and I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. Due to the house, they share a bedroom. They are both in cribs. The older child learned how to crawl out of his crib. I know the internet says he's ready for toddler bed, but not in this situation. Little dude has already crawled into his little sister's bed and woken her up at all hours, and even in spite of that, he just won't stay in there, he wants to play and he's gonna do it no matter what.

So I turned his crib around, cause the side that faces the wall has a headboard type thing on it that comes up high. But then he was just sitting on the edge of the crib bars looking out the window, and I figured that wasn't safe. So I swapped his crib with his sister's, no window there. Then he figured out he could push the crib from the wall and crawl out in the gap (in the old place the crib was wedged in between a dresser and a rocking chair, so it didn't move out).

Also thought about unscrewing the base of the crib and laying it on the ground, but I think the gap will be too much.

So I only have one real idea left. Ditch his crib, throw a mattress on the floor, and divide the room in half with a baby gate. He can have some running around space then without being a terror to his sister (or me waking up to him playing with trucks in the kitchen) and he won't risk falling out of his crib coming up with annoying new toddler methods of escape.

I'm writing this after a long, turbulent afternoon and previous night of him refusing sleep and naps and keeping his sister up. But after successfully getting them to pass out, I have the dilemma that I don't have precise measurements, as I'm not risking entering that room. But it would need to be a baby gate about 8 to 9 feet (96+ inches) long to cut the room in half. Now, I see a few online that long, but especially with a mattress in there, the seemingly standard height of 28 inches will not do at all.

So if anyone has any suggestions for a baby gate both pretty tall and really long (or any bright ideas otherwise to contain him), it would be much appreciated",parenting
Had my first experience with birthday party no-shows AND non-RSVPing guests,"I know people are busy. I get that life gets crazy with kids and jobs and all that. Totally understand. But why oh why do people do these things?

Six kids from my son’s class RSVPd to me via text saying their kids would be there and were excited. I made goodie bags for everyone, and made party games that were specifically for that number of kids. Three of them showed up. 

But prior to the party, two people RSVPd way late. Like, two days before the party. Which made me have to run out to the store and buy more items for additional goodie bags. (Which, of course, it turns out I didn’t need to do, because of the ones that didn’t show.)

ETA: one of them was my son’s bud who kept telling him that she was coming, but I hadn’t heard from her parents. So I texted the mom (they’re divorced) and asked if she knew if dad was bringing her since it’s his weekend. THEN I got the text from him informing me that she’d be there....so I imagine if I hadn’t texted mom, he never would have said anything and just showed up. 

No one is so busy that they can’t send a text to RSVP. Especially when the invites are sent almost *a month* in advance and I gave a very generous window. 

And for fuck’s sake, if you say you’re coming, try to actually come. Luckily it wasn’t a situation where my son was hurt by it, or one where no one showed up (those stories break my heart), but still annoying.",parenting

5 month old refuses naps and won't calm down for anyone but me (mom),"My baby has had sleep issues since she was about 2.5 months old. Some days are better than others, she'll sometimes take a nice 2.5 hr nap (mostly at MIL's house) but that's rare. I'm lucky if I can get her to nap for an hour. Sometimes I spend longer trying to get her to nap than she spends staying asleep.  She'll do maybe a 20 minute cat nap and then be fully awake all of a sudden.  Not crying usually, just kicking her legs and chattering most of the time. 
I have tried EVERYTHING. Nested bean sleep sack,  swaddle, no swaddle,  partial swaddle,  darkened room,  white noise, religiously following a nap time routine, but nothing works. If I put her to sleep drowsy but awake as countless articles suggest, she wakes fully up and starts rolling around in her crib and slowly escalates to screaming. Her pediatrician was vague about whether she's old enough for sleep training.
I am so worried about her. She sleeps through the night most of the time but even so she's not getting the recommended amount of sleep for her age. I start to put her to bed around 7 or 7:30, same routine every night, but sometimes it takes hours before she finally falls asleep for good. 
If anyone but me tries to put her to sleep (nap or bedtime) she cries and cries for ages but the minute I take her she's fine. I don't want to reinforce this behavior by continuing to take her but I don't know what else to do. She's already not napping enough as it is. 
Has anyone else experienced this with a baby who just does not want to nap? I feel like I'm losing it. I feel like I'm in survival mode but also maybe giving her bad habits?? I just don't know what to do and I'm crying with frustration all the time.",parenting

How do you do with screaming fits?,"My baby is 9 months. She has always been very vocal. First couple of months she would scream and cry as soon as she wet her diaper even the slightest bit. We went through massive amounts of diapers until I realized that the eco friendly bamboo diapers were the issue and switched to cheaper ones. The crying has been to a minimum since.

In the last couple days she has had multiple hysterical fits of screaming. Take away the dirty piece of wood she managed to get her hands on? Hysterical. Papa pats her on the back and she burps? Absolutely hysterical until he picks her up. Set her down on the ground? Shrieking. Set her down in the pack and play? You get the picture.

She is happy as long as we are holding her and entertaining her. She is headache inducing unhappy if (from what we can tell) something is different than the way she would like it.

She is really loud. 

We do the whole checklist - diaper, teething, gas, naps, cuddles, feeding, etc but sometimes the only thing that works is to let her play with whatever it is that has caught her fancy. She stops the shrieking if she gets what she wants.

She is a baby, and I've read you can't spoil a baby, but my partner and I are feeling positively terrorized. I don't want to get in the habit of letting my kid have whatever she wants, and I especially don't want to reward screaming, but I don't know how to handle this.

My friends kids around the same age are so much quieter and they don't do the whole hysterical thing.

"just an exhausted, worried mom looking for advice and experience","when my baby boy was 3 weeks old, we got him on w babywise schedule and he was an amazing sleeper and followed the schedule to the letter. but now he’s over 6 months old and his schedule hasn’t changed since he was 2 months. actually- i take that back- he’s regressed. 

he used to wake up at 5 and have a eat, wake, sleep cycle ever 2-2.5 hours until 6 pm, when he’d go to sleep for the night. and then he’d sleep through the night. now he wakes up at 5 and has an eat, wake, sleep cycle every 2 hours until 5 pm and wakes up like 3 times a night for food. 

and the amount of food he eats is insane. he breastfeeds 8-10 times a day until he’s full or i’m out of milk. if i run out of milk, he gets supplemental formula (about 4-8 oz a day usually). and we give him solids twice a day- once for lunch around noon and once for dinner around 4 pm. sometimes he’ll give us a long nap for an hour or two, but all the other ones are 40ish minutes. 

according to the babywise method, he should be having two to three naps a day and his cycles should be 3.5-4 hours. and he should still be sleeping through the nights. 

i’m beyond exhausted right now and worried that something might be wrong with my baby boy. or that there’s something wrong with me and my milk. i just want to curl up and cry and i feel like a failure.

"Having Grandma be your daycare can be awesome, but it can also suck.","Can I just vent really quickly?

My MIL lives with us &amp; helps with child care.  She basically functions as a live-in nanny.  She’s a sweet woman. But man, can she annoy me. She says things like “[toddler’s name] doesn’t do that when he’s with ME.”  She sometimes calls him “my king,” I once heard her call him The King of Kings.  She calls my baby girl “my queen” &amp; also “mi reina” in Spanish. They’re too young for it to be a joke, it just feels a bit much to me.  She constantly refers to them as “my babies” &amp; “my kids.”  She constantly calls them to come to her to get them away from me &amp; says “Mommy’s busy” but I have to tell her it’s ok, they’re fine.  She will keep trying to interact with them even if they’re interacting with me, but by talking about something completely different than what we are doing.  Again, she’s a sweet woman, &amp; we have some cultural differences, &amp; they are the most important things in her life, but sometimes I just want to be mommy without her around.  And I feel selfish but I want to be more important to my kids than Grandma.

My husband at least recognizes that she’s not perfect, she’s not the sharpest tool in the shed.  But he will do anything to not hurt her feelings &amp; heap tons of praise on her.

Strange potty training issue,"My daughter (4) took a bit longer than usual to potty train due to a speech delay but since she got it she’s been doing awesome. Very few accidents and we haven’t even had to nighttime train. We’ve really lucked out except for one hiccup.

She attends preschool and daycare so I’m sure that she has to ask there but we are trying to convince her that she doesn’t need to ask when she’s at home. Asking wouldn’t be such a big deal if she didn’t wake up at 3 am and cry until I wake up and give her permission to go potty. 

We’ve tried explaining that she doesn’t need to ask, leaving her door open at night with a nightlight on in the bathroom so it’s inviting, and leaving a potty chair in her room at night. Nothing seems to help her feel comfortable going to the bathroom on her own.

I immediately learned that I'm not giving proper feedback. I can be subtle and quiet. I'll give him a high five and sometimes say good job, BUT I've been giving him high fives for no reason sometimes, so he doesn't see that as positive feedback.

Instead, for the last couple nights, I've been giving him what I like is over the top positive feedback. LOUD but not deafening, exaggerated encouragement, and sometimes picking him up, smothering him with hugs and kisses and tickles, which he laughs at and loves.

Last night, before bed, I was trying to prompt him to ask for something. 

I modeled asking him for a hug, by just saying ""I"" and having my arms out for a hug. My goal is to make him say ""want hug.""

Instead of giving me a hug, he said, ""No, want book"" and reached off the end of the bed to a bookshelf and grabbed a book.

I gave him a hug anyway.",parenting
Separated parents with a newborn?,"I’m 7 months pregnant and the father and I recently split. 

I’m just wondering what him or his side of the family seeing the baby will look like at the very beginning. I’m planning on breastfeeding and I’m not going to really want to leave the house from what I hear? His mom was saying the baby could go to their house, that he doesn’t have to “visit”, but wouldn’t that throw off baby’s routine? He’s my first, so I obviously don’t know much. Just curious to see what people’s experiences with this have been like.",parenting
What’s the most annoying comments people make to you about your parenting??,"I get tired of hearing this from my parents and my husbands parents “Well, when you guys were little we had to deal with this, this, this.” Or “try having three under 5”. 

It’s hard enough being a parent. I’m trying my hardest and drain every bit of energy, patience, love, and care into my children. I hate when people act like they had it harder, I get it that situations can be harder and I’m thankful for my kids and life. But i personally feel like it’s rude to act like my feelings are invalid because they had more children to deal with. 

Rant over!!",parenting
My 3yo is a runner,"I know my kid just wants to run around, explore and be a ninja/superhero/wolf but I'm having the hardest time getting him to listen to me and not run away when I call him.

Yesterday was a prime example. I wanted him to stay with me and come up our house steps when I was loaded with groceries but he doubled back and ran back down to the sidewalk/driveway.

While I live on a quiet enough street, it wasn't actually a big deal, but the same 'not listening' happens in car parks / grocery stores etc and just ends up being a negative experience all round.

Next month his class are going to a little farm and the school have basically told me that he won't be allowed to go because they don't have the resources to have one adult looking after him exclusively. 

I've tried being strict, offering fun things if he listens, chocolate bribery etc. He understands me, he gets it...he just prefers to do his own thing, consequences be damned.",parenting
Persisting with a childminder?,"My daughter (3) has been going to a childminder for 2 days a week for a month. When she is there, she loves it- I get sent videos and pictures of her having so much fun with the other children. When she’s with me and we see the childminder at the school gates, she runs over and hugs her and tells her she’ll see her next week. However, she winds herself up before she goes, she cries and says she doesn’t like it. She’s started to do this the night before she goes as well. The mother guilt this creates is awful when I am in work. 

My question is how long would you all persist with her going to the childminder if she continues to get herself upset? It’s been a month now and I don’t know what to do. 

Thanks in advance!",parenting
I am not particularly maternal and struggling with whether or not I should have another child,"I found out when my son was born that I wasn’t the picture of motherhood that I imagined. I wasn’t that maternal so motherhood didn’t come naturally to me. I am a good mom and I love my son more than anything in the world but a part of me misses my free time, being a full-time working mom. 

My son is almost 2 and part of me wants another baby because of the love my son has brought into my husband and my lives and I know he would absolutely love a sibling, he’s amazing with other kids. But I also am already struggling with the tiredness and feel like we have given up our whole lives for our son. 

So we are either going for a bigger gap (3-4 years) or only have the one child, but I don’t want him to be lonely and I’ve heard it gets easier with two kids when they get older. 

Anyone been through similar feelings and how did it work out? 

Is two kids infinitely harder and does it get easier? Or are your only children happy by themselves?",parenting
Can’t stop regretting choices we made,"My first child (5M) hated daycare. We watched him cry everyday at pick up and drop off until he was 2.5 years. So when we had our second (2.5M) and we were financially better off, we hired a nanny. He was a huge baby over 90th percentile. She overstated her experience, but seemed genuine and kindhearted. 

She wasn’t able to get him to drink milk from a bottle and wasn’t good at problem solving. We probably should have just fired her, but we already fired a first nanny for putting him in an unsafe sleep situation which could have killed him. I wish I were exaggerating, but she put heavy adult  winter blankets around him and one ended up covering his entire head while he slept and that’s how I found him. The image of seeing him potentially dead is still seared into my brain.

At least this new nanny seemed to keep him safe and watched over him. And trying to find a new one while working and having already had to take extra time off because the first one failed was just too stressful.

8 months later, though, my child was thin and under 30th percentile. Basically stopped growing. We knew his growth had slowed a little 2 months in at his 6 month checkup, but we didn’t realize the extent of the problem until the 9 month checkup. We went into full problem solving mode then. She finally quit, but the damage was done. We put him into daycare at 1 year old and he had no issues and was fine.

I know I should be grateful that he’s healthy and alive, but I can’t shake my guilt and regret. I can’t look at his baby pictures without being flooded with the stress I felt at the time. I beat myself up for trying to make things work with bottle feeding instead of just nursing him since I worked from home. I hate myself for putting my job performance above my child. I worry that his speech delays now are because of his nanny basically trying to force feed him milk for hours at a time or that lack of nourishment at the time has caused other delays we can’t see.

I love my kiddos as they are, but when I put 18 month clothing on my 2.5 year old, I can’t help feel like I failed him as a mom. Does anyone else feel like this? How do you get over it?",parenting
What to do about 6th grade English teacher who doesn’t teach grammar because of the app “grammarly”,"It’s 4:30 in the morning and I can’t sleep. I’m haunted by a conversation I had with my son’s 6th grade teacher yesterday,

This teacher does not work from a book, guide or website. There is no outline or syllabus.  No handouts. There is no homework. Everything is done in class. She posts grades online, without attaching the work - so parents can’t see what their kid is doing.

2 days ago he had to finish his in-class work at home, so I get a glimpse of what’s going on.

Unfortunately, his answers for part of the assignment are riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors. And she has already graded it: A-.

I worked on the answer with him for the unfinished portion, and my daughter (3.8 gpa in nursing school) looks it over as well for errors. 

It’s asking a convoluted question about the story he just read - and because I have no reference (books, syllabus, etc.) he does his best. He submitted it 2 days ago - yesterday he received a B-.

Apparently he answered the question wrong. When I ask her how we would have gotten clarity on the question, she responded, “he needs to ask me”. So I suggest a handout explaining assignments - which she refused. 

When I said that there was no way for me to help him because I didn’t have any reference to what she is looking for, she said I needed to ask my son what she meant. But if he knew what she meant he wouldn’t have gotten it wrong....ugh.

Then we moved on to the A- for subpar work. She grades on the “idea”, which is great - but his writing needs work.  He needs to be learning some 6th grade grammar skills. Which I discover she does not teach. She feels they will just “pick up” proper grammar techniques organically. Then she says it-

“Kids don’t really need grammar anymore, they can just cut and paste into grammarly.”

This is his only English class.

She then goes on to say he is allowed to revise the answer for credit. It’s a lengthy answer (3-4 sentences). So I say, “great, he just needs to rewrite the paragraph?” To which she says - “it’s not a paragraph - it’s an answer”.  

Then she tells me the “revision” will ask the same question - but from a different story. 

So I say, “so, it’s a new project”, and she responds- no, it’s a revision. I push back and say - “writing a whole new response to a different story is not a revision” ...and she rolls her eyes and says if I can come up with a better word she is open. 

Am I taking crazy pills????

I actually had to google what a paragraph was and what revision meant after the meeting because I started to doubt my own understanding.

Am I wrong to be nervous? Should I just let it go and teach him grammar from a workbook at home?",parenting
When kids break stuff accidentally,"This is just some rambling thoughts I'm having today, prompted by my son dropping a bowl. 

I remember my parents getting very angry with me whenever I accidentally broke stuff. This made me scared to tell them, which caused them to get angry when I didn't tell them I'd broken something. 

This, to me, seems like a very ineffective parenting strategy. All they did was make me afraid. I think they did so in other ways too. I don't really blame them, my parents both come from very difficult home situations, such as narcissism, alcoholism and neglect. 

But I catch myself doing similar things now, which is something I really don't want to be doing. I stopped myself and instead praised my son for trying to put his bowl away after finishing breakfast, and I told him it's okay, and sometimes accidents happen. 

I think I did the right thing in the end but I just wished it was my first response to these things. 

I feel like I've never really been taught how to parent, and it's really frustrating to find out after having children how bad my childhood actually was. I mean, as far as I know, I was never physically abused, but I wasn't raised very well either. 

Idk why I'm even posting this, I just need to put these thoughts somewhere I think.",parenting
Is my child better off without me?,"I never wanted to have kids however 18 months ago my partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. I begged her to have an abortion but she refused. For most of my life I was sure I never wanted kids and the only thing that had stopped me getting a vasectomy was family/friends telling me that one day I would change your mind. Therefore, I didn't want to get a vasectomy in case what I was being told was true because there can be a lot of problems reversing it.

Although I have been a father for the last 18 months, my feelings towards being a parent have not changed in the slightest. I will be getting that vasectomy and while it will prevent any further accidents, it doesn't reverse what has already been done. There is literally nothing about being a parent I enjoy and I don't understand why people would choose to be a parent.

The only reason I stay and try to be a father is because I was responsible for his existence and my son is innocent - he doesn't deserve psychological damage by having a parent abandon him.

The sad truth is the only time I feel any joy is when I have left the house and can go out and enjoy my own life freely whether it’s at work, the gym, with friends - anywhere else but home. From the moment I step in the door, I feel drowned in sadness.  Its got so bad, that now my future feels so hopeless I've stopped exercising, don't even want to socialise and see family or friends, and only enjoy working because its the only thing that distracts me from pain.

So much of my life has being damaged by having a child, quality time spending together alone, social life, getting enough sleep, no time to myself to reset and unwind (I need this daily to function), daily sex whenever we want, having weekends to go and live your own life for you, reading books, coming home from work to relax, travelling unhindered, staying out all night, my happiness, my hope and taking business risks (as other people are now involved).

I want to enjoy having a lifelong career where I regularly get to move cities and/or countries and be able to uproot my life and move it at the drop of a hat. My life needs constant change and big challenges – unfortunately being a parent is not one of those challenges that gives me any kind of fulfilment.

For me personally, life isn't worth living if it’s the same as everyone else's. Kids, buying a house with a partner and living in the in the same city/country your whole life is not a life I want or a life I enjoy or one I would be happy living. I know many people enjoy it and that is fine, but for me personally that is the furthest thing from happiness I can imagine. Some people might take offence to that but the fact is not everyone is the same, and different things give different people joy.

I have exhausted my energy focusing on tying to have a good attitude and perspective about being a father since the moment knew the pregnancy would move forward, each day I try to visualise myself being happy as a parent, I say positive things to myself, I spend time with my son playing with him and hoping that I will stay enjoying at least something, but so often images of what he has cost me both in the short term and the rest of my life flow back into my mind. These feelings about not wanting to be a parent are so ingrained for the 30+ years of my life I honestly have no idea how to change them or if they can be. I don’t know if what I am doing to change how I feel is wrong or I am just not built this way.

Obviously, I don't want to hurt my son so I try not to let any of these feelings be seeing by him, but on some level, he must feel or see it. I have never hated my life more than since I read the pregnancy test.

If I stay and be his parent, I am living my life for him at the cost of me giving up everything about my relationship and own life that I enjoy. If it keeps going the way it is, I will go through the rest of my life miserable and grow old feeling I have lived a wasted life. Being a child of a parent who is unhappy being a parent must have some sort of long-term damage so staying and things going the way they are is going to damage him. As it stands, I feel all I have to look forward to is a miserable home life then death. These feelings are real for me every day.

I have considered just ending my own life, but then that's another thing that could mess him up, probably even more. This is my most preferred choice but this would not only damage him but also my family, friends and partner.

Another option is just to leave completely and let him live with his mother and him only be surrounded by people who are grateful he is around, but then that could also mess him up when he later wonders why his dad left and comes to the conclusion he wasn’t wanted. While I might hate being a parent, I do love him and it pains me to see him hurt. Also I worry about how hard it would be for her being a single parent.

I am completely torn about what the right thing is to do and feel exhausted trying to change my perspective and feelings on the situation. Each day only gets harder and I don't know how much longer I can endure this.  

My partner knows how I feel and tries to help me see the positives; she has been extremely resilient and patient with the whole situation but I can’t expect her to keep going like this either. I stay hopeful there will be some progress, but nothing I do seems to help. This has nothing to do about being ""afraid"" of responsibility, or being a parent. It has to do with getting no joy or fulfilment out of parenting and it taking away all the things in life that do.

I apologise this was so long but felt all information was needed so that an informed solution to this problem could be provided. I assume by most people’s standards I’d be considered a horrible person for feeling this way but remember I am here to actually do the right thing so ask you please don’t use this platform to throw judgement and abuse, I’m asking for you to instead provide a genuine solution that you feel will have the best possible outcome for all.

When providing a solution please do not think about the money aspect of things (if leaving is your solution), it’s the quality of life and mental health of everyone I am most concerned about.

The important questions I have are:

1. Has anyone been in this situation and if so, how did it turn out? Are things better?
2. Of all options, what do you think will cause the least damage to my son?
3. Is there another option I haven't considered?",parenting
My 1 year old is a bully!,"So I am a stay at home mom to 2 kids, 2 year old boy and 1 year old girl, and I’m worried about my daughter. My son wasn’t feeling well today so he spent most of the day on the couch.

4yo waking up in the night and won't go back to bed,"I'm looking for some sleep advice please!

My kid just turned 4. At the beginning of September she started a new classroom (but located at the same daycare she's been at for 2 years, same classmates).

Previously she was a pretty great sleeper. Goes to sleep right away (by 8pm), and waits until her OK To Wake light goes off at 7 to get up. Starting Sept 1 she no longer sleeps through the night. She goes to sleep pretty well (although sometimes not). Then she will get up at midnight, 1, 2, even 5am. Sometimes it's a quiet ""Mommy I can't sleep"" and other times its sobbing and screaming ""i can't sleep!""

We have tried so many things. Reward charts. Praise. Special blankets. Longer bed time routine with quiet time. Taking away fun things (like no TV time). I tried ignoring her (after saying please go back to bed, I am done talking about this) but then she escalates to climbing on top of me to get my attention. I've even told her ""you don't HAVE to sleep. If you really can't sleep, read books or play quietly with your toys"". But she just stands by the side of my bed screaming. 

She doesn't say shes scared of anything, and generally loves her bed and her room.  Sometimes it happens 5-10x a night. We are all exhausted(especially her!!)

I read this method on many different websites: ""If your child gets out of bed, you can say something like ‘It’s time to sleep. Please stay in your bed’. Then return her gently and calmly to bed, without talking or scolding. Do this as many times as it takes until your child stays in bed.""

The problem with that is, she gets so angry and worked up that she plants her feet and screams no and there is no way to ""calmly and gently"" get her to bed. And of course raising my voice or forcing her into bed would make things worse. 

My pediatrician recommended the book ""what to do when you dread your bed"", but I'm hoping you all have a few ideas for me while I wait for Amazon to deliver it!

"Upset over school's handling of lice, does this sound normal?","I get a text from another parent quite early this morning that their child has lice. This was very early, before school. So I went through my daughter's hair with a fine tooth comb. She is in early grade school. There was nothing there. I decided to put her hair in little braids and then pull in to a bun at the back. This means, I was definitely looking close at her hair. I used a fine tooth comb to make the little braids too. This was by around seven am. I sent her to school. I actually did not want to send her to school today after finding out someone in the class had lice.  Around 5pm, we are at the store when my daughter tells me her head really itches. It was not itching before. I look at her head in the store and could see tons of little white specks. I google again what it looks like to have head lice and this appears to be it. I quickly leave the store and call my sister who tells me to go get a special shampoo and where. I head to that store. While inside the store, waiting to check out, I can see one small lice bug crawling in her hair! I have been working on her hair for the last three or four hours and she is in bed now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the part I am really ticked about. My daughter is my eighth child. No other of my children going to public school has ever had lice (but some did home school for a few years in the middle). This child is at a charter school. I found out the little girl, her best friend, was at school today even though she had lice. The school says it is fine for them to come. To top it off, the school never notified any of us about the lice. And they never looked at the kids to screen them for lice. I ended up talking with a parent who has been at the school for longer than us, this is their third year, and both her children have had lice already during the last two years, at this school. I am taking this to mean, the school does not take any sort of measures when lice goes around and it has gone around multiple times, at least three times in two school years and two months of this school year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trouble transitioning to a new full-time job with kindergarten + daycare,"My wife just started (1 month ago) her first full-time job, 8am - 5pm.  It's a huge change from being a stay at home Mom and we're both getting used to the new schedule.  Not helping is the fact that my work day starts a full hour before they get up, so my wife has the burden of getting them ready and out the door.

My oldest son, 5 years old, just started kindergarten and my youngest, 2 years old, just started daycare.  Big transitions for these two as well.

My wife's biggest problem is getting my 5 year old ready.  He's very sensitive in general but especially in the morning and prone to outbursts, shutdowns, and on some occasions, getting physical by slapping or kicking.  Normally this behavior is handled with timeout and a stern talk but that's not really an option when you need to be out the door in 15 minutes.

We've taken things away like video games, TV, and toys but at some point there's not much left to take away.

If we don't address it then and there, he usually forgets what he did so later punishment just seems cruel.

Tips for teaching gratitude?,"My son is 7 and is typically pretty good about saying thank you. There are times where he’ll be super grateful for something and say thank you over and over, and is really sweet about it. But more often, we have to remind him.  

I get nervous when someone does something nice for him or gives him a gift, because it’s so embarrassing when he’s not thankful. 

My parents instilled this in me in a shitty way - making me feel bad if I didn’t show the perfect amount of gratitude for gifts and gestures. It was always a “how DARE you, you ingrate!” type of reaction, not a “let’s teach you this life skill” type of thing. Now I have, depending on how you look at it, either a very good sense of showing gratitude OR a complex, that has me always writing thank you cards even for really small things, and anxiety that I didn’t show enough gratitude to someone after they give me a gift. So this is probably why it strikes such a chord for me now as a parent. 

I obviously don’t want him to be that way, but we’re struggling with how to teach him to show appreciation.",parenting
Rejected and dejected Dad to 9 month old question,"Hi all, I’m hoping a few of you out there might have similar stories in the past or present and may be able to offer a little insight.

Our 9 month year old daughter has only in the last week or so started strongly insisting on being put to bed by her mum. Prior to this she was just as happy to have me put her to bed and soothe her on night waking. But now if I try she screams until her mum takes over. 

This follows a pretty bad virus she has a couple of weeks ago, which got better after a couple of days that both my wife and I attended to her in equal measure. However it did impact on her way of sleeping. Most nights we would remove her from her crib to sleep on my wife to keep her upright as her breathing was affected by her respiratory infection. We realised this may have an adverse effect of her sleeping alone in her crib, but the concern of her breathing was obviously superseding. Then the following week my wife had to catch up on a great deal of work (done at home) and I tended to our daughter through the days without any issues as I have had 3 weeks off work solidly at home with the fam.

Feeding, changing, play, all of these she can have either of us tending to. It’s just being put down for sleep and reassurance during the night. 

For the most part my wife is her primary carer with the exception of these past couple of weeks. She has still however been ever present and involved with things and our daughters routine is in tact. She will sleep on me only in her sling for naps. 

I understand 9 months is often when the clingy stage can start, and that the illness then my wife’s work have perhaps pushed it to the fore. However I’m hoping for at least some resolve that I can let my wife rest as our daughter is waking much more frequently through the night clearly needing reassurance. 

Also I can not lie that I have a feeling of rejection from my daughter for the first time. 

Hoping for some insight! Thanks to anyone in advance, and please forgive my long winded, self pitying rant.",parenting

My son (15M) wants to attend an Ivy League school. Should I be doing anything or recommending anything to help him get there?,"At age 10 my oldest decided that he wanted to go to an Ivy League school for college. He has been dead set on this for years but has added a few other top ranked non Ivies to his list. 

My husband and I are both UConn grads. I am a kindergarten teacher at a private school and he is an accountant. We have 4 kids, 3 boys and 1 girl. We live in an average suburb with average schools. My husband has 3 siblings who all attended great schools. His brother went to Dartmouth and is now a dentist, one sister went to MIT and is an engineer, and his other sister went to Duke and is a college professor. Their parents had a super laid back attitude. My son may have been inspired by his aunts and uncle because he wants the same for himself. 

I am not sure what to do to help him achieve his goals. He doesn't have any special talents. He is in marching band, cross country, and track. He does well in cross country and track but I doubt it is well enough to have top schools recruiting him. He does Lego Robotics, theater, math club, and Model UN but again, nothing out of the box there. He has above a 4.0 GPA but so does every single person applying to those schools. He is a middle class suburban white boy.

Need advice,"My five year old daughter (second child) has been testing my patience greatly as of late, and I could use some advice.

Whenever she is asked to get ready to go somewhere/do something and she's already engaged in something else, she flips out. Screams. Cries. Falls flat on the floor and loses her mind. She does it at home, at daycare, you name it.

This started about a year ago. Before now, she was super eager to please and always wanted to be mom and dad's 'good girl'. 

She's super stubborn too, and gets very angry when we confront her on certain behaviours. For example, she was jumping on the couch the other day and I told her to stop because she could hurt herself (and ruin my damn couch, I might add), and she freaked out and started crying/screaming that it's 'not fair' and 'she doesn't love me anymore'.

This morning, my wife told her to get ready for school and she shouted back ""Don't force me! Just let me do what I need to do!""

I'm starting to get to the end of my rope. Little things are causing irrational, inversely proportionate reactions. Big things (like being banned from an activity as punishment for bad behaviour) cause nuclear meltdowns. She only calms down after several minutes of talking about it/hugs/timeout on stairs, etc.

Yes, I know she's five. I'm just at a loss because we never experienced this with our first child (boy, now 10), and everything we've tried isn't working. We're starting to worry, because we don't want the daycare to tell us not to bring her back again because of her freakouts... it's nearly impossible to find a daycare with vacant spots, let alone one as good as the one we found.

Any suggestions?",parenting

"2.5 year old too excited to eat, I'm worried about having to make her ""finish her plate"".","While I did not have a terrible childhood by any stretch of the imagination, one of the things I wish my parents did not do for me was the old school ""no leaving the dinner table until you finish your plate"". It is part of the reason for my unhealthy connection to food, and when my wife was pregnant we both agreed that would be a set rule.

  
Cue my daughter, my first child. Like a lot of toddlers, she is a walking ball of energy. Constantly moving, always into new things, asking a lot of questions, the usual. She has absolutely no interest in food outside of milk, and while I'm not a psychologist I want to believe it's because she would have to take time out of her day playing to eat, and that is not acceptable to her. I wasn't too worried about it at first because she always had so much energy and I lived by the mantra ""if she's hungry, she'll eat"".

&amp;#x200B;

But we had a doctor's check-up for our youngest and she was pairing up to get a flu shot and on a whim I decided to get her weighed. She had only gained 2 ounces in 6 months, and that was with her clothes on so she might have even lost weight. My wife and I have also been noticing that she wakes up ""trembling"", that we are sure is from low blood sugar, but the girl still doesn't stop. She doesn't exhibit any other symptoms of a child with failure to thrive and by all accounts is a perfectly appropriate toddler (except she has an incredible aversion to other children, but that's a story for another time).

&amp;#x200B;

When she does eat, it's usually cereal (Cheerio's) or rice, MAYBE with a little broccoli or apple on the side. She likes sweets but will only have a bite (unless it's M&amp;M's), and appears to prefer blander foods, which again is okay.

&amp;#x200B;

We are worried we'll have to sit her down until she eats more than just a couple bites of rice. She does eat snacks in front of the TV, but for meals my wife and I try to make sit in a high-chair with no TV while she eats. Does anyone have any other ideas?",parenting
My daughters paternal grandma is driving me nuts,"Ok y’all I need someone to tell me if I’m overreacting whereas my guilt is taking over. My daughters father and I co-parent 50/50. We get along pretty well but his mom drives me nuts. She watches my daughter during the day and they get along great, I know she’s an awesome grandmother. 

In the past she’s had some boundary issues but has been fine now. Every one of my daughters first holidays I bought a jump suit with the holiday on it, I wanted to keep them and hold onto them and make it into a project of my daughters “firsts”. Well when her dad and I split he had some of my stuff there I guess he didn’t give me, including her Halloween jump suit. I saw his sister posting pics of her son in it, and I immediately got upset. I specifically bought her that as my daughters “first” and realized I didn’t even have it in my box. I texted him asking for it and he replied “k”. 

I get it may have been shitty, but I just feel like I do all of the driving with the back and forth so he can have her because he doesn’t have a car, I take her to the docs, pay for her extracurricular classes, I don’t have any child support (I don’t need it but besides the point), I always trade days with him when he wants to go out to concerts or with his friends, I feel like I’m REALLY easy to co-parent with and I feel like the least you can do is give me my daughters first Halloween outfit. I know I’ll regret not asking for it In the future. So why do I feel bad?",parenting

That night she thought that I should do it after saying good night. She didn't communicate this with me but was upset that I didn't do what she thought.

I was so confused when she started to cry because I did everything the same way I do every night.

Partner keeps asking for space from us,"Hi everyone, 
Myself (28f) and my partner (30m) have an 5 month old baby and we had a pretty big fight 10weeks ago. The fight basically consisted of me saying that I wasn’t going to bring our baby to his parents anymore every Sunday as when he feels like it he will say he no longer wants us there as he wants some space - even when we are ready and about to leave. He can’t understand how I would ever say such a thing but I feel like it’s only fair when he will tell us not to come when it suits him. Now let me point out I said I would take him over some days during the week and also they could visit us (which they don’t do). I was never saying they couldn’t see him at all. 

Ever since this argument things haven’t been right - he keeps saying he’s not over it because he can’t believe I would say such a thing just because he wanted some alone time. He’s clearly missing the point. 

Because he can’t get over this it has caused other arguments since as we keep reverting back to it and now he is away home to his parents for 2 weeks, maybe more to get some more space to try and “hit the reset button”. In this week so far he has made one plan to see his baby and that’s for a couple of hours this weekend. He still doesn’t know when he’s coming home. 

He is very close with his family and I feel like his child hasn’t taken over the no.1 spot. As an example - I said what shall we do for babies first Christmas and he told me he didn’t know what I was doing but he was gonna be spending it with his family. No compromise, no consideration for us. He also can’t seem to move on from a fight like most people.

Has anyone else ever dealt with this kind of thing? What should I do??
I want him to be there more and be emotionally more able to deal with general ups and downs of life without having to run home to his parents for weeks and leave me alone with our baby while he just acts like someone with no responsibilities.

I would love to know if anyone else has had issues with their partner that are similar when dealing with a new baby.

TLDR: partner runs home to his parents after any fight and leaves me alone with baby",parenting

"My daughter (8y) saw an inappropriate video at a friend's house, and now she is terrified","My daughter went to a friend's house for the first time over the weekend. I dropped her off in the early afternoon and picked her up a couple hours later. When I did, she was extremely clingy, and it was clear something was bothering her. When I asked her in the car, she told me that her friend had shown her videos of Chucky, and she was terrified. It was difficult to know for sure, but my understanding is that it was about 15 minutes of two or three YouTube clips that had Chucky in them.
 
She has remained scared for the last five days, and in school yesterday the teacher said that she was afraid to go to the restroom by herself.

Am I a bad mother or is my son just really challenging?,"My son is 3, daughter is 1.5 and we have another due in two months. Obviously my son is at an age where he’s exploring his limits and asking a lot of questions about life. I try to follow the positive parenting and discipline approach most of the time but I don’t have the best parenting days sometimes. Like today I just feel so frustrated and powerless that I’m just crying because it just feels extremely difficult. He’ll go from one destructive activity to another, he can’t be stopped or disciplined easily, it feels like he needs constant outlets for his energy which I try to provide- sometimes I’ll take them to the park twice a day and I have books and toys around and things like playdoh and kinetic sand and dress up clothes. Then if I provide too much playtime he gets hyperactive and overtired. He’s also very sensitive to things and unless the day goes perfectly he won’t nap which exacerbates the button pushing behavior. When he gets frustrated he’ll hit me. He orders me around constantly and wants me to for example say certain words the exact way he tells me to say it or tells me certain things to do an exact way when I’m driving or cooking. It drives me bonkers. It’s really difficult constantly maintaining my cool around him without either raising my voice or just flat out crying because I feel like I’m an object being tortured and abused. It’s awful.",parenting
My 9 year old daughter says she feels 'worthless',"I have a daughter who is 9 years old and she is in 3rd grade. Ever since this school year started she has been telling me how her friends from 2nd grade don't hang out with her anymore. She says she is not being bullied, but she simply doesn't get along with the other kids.

She said kids tell her, ""I don't want to play with you today."" ""You're weird."" 

One of her best friends doesn't talk to her anymore and tells her that she doesn't want to play with her either. 

Yesterday, she told me she felt unwanted and worthless. That nothing has a meaning. 

Honestly, that scared me to the core. I have suffered from depression for years and it scares me to think my 9 year old would feel that way. I don't know if this is a normal thing  kids around this age say and later change. I don't know what to think really.

Are there any parents out there who have had a similar experience with their child?

My baby rolled over at 2.5 weeks and continued to do so until about 2 months. Now he's 3.5 months and will barely turn his head at tummy time.,"Hi everyone,

So like the title suggests, my baby had been rolling over during tummy time all on his own since he was tiny. I was pretty surprised after having read that it wasn't until 4 months that they usually start doing this..

My baby seems pretty strong in his neck, he has no problem holding it up on his own when he sits on the potty (he wouldn't poop in diapers so he goes on the potty multiple times a day), and he even jolly jumps and has pretty good neck control except when he gets tired, and even then it's not ""flopping"". He arches his back but only lifts his legs and gets mad when on his tummy. 

Maybe I haven't been doing enough tummy time since he's only up for so long and we've been doing other things to play instead (working on holding rattles now, or jolly jumping, or sitting in his exersaucer).

Any tips on how I can get him to start using those muscles during tummy time? Are his arms weak? Is it weird that he used to do it every time when he was only weeks old and now can't or is it just because he's a chubazoid now?

Thanks for all the advice!

Son noticed his dad doesn't wear a helmet,"My 4yo son has been commenting that my husband doesn't wear a helmet when he skateboards to work. I just replied that he probably should but I didn't expound. We always make my son wear a helmet on his scooter and eventually when/if he starts skateboarding, I expect him to wear a helmet.

Ideally, my husband would wear a helmet. But realistically he doesn't want to and most adults don't. He does wear one on a bike. Everywhere I go, I've been taking note of skaters and no one wears a helmet.

This feels like a ""do as I say, not as I do"" situation, which I know is confusing for kids. What should I (or my husband) say about it to my son?

Kids and faith," So, I used to be a conservative Christian, and I'm not anymore. I'm divorcing my husband, and he is still an Evangelical. My kids are 9 &amp; 12. Husband for some reason insists that I must tell the kids I'm not a Christian anymore. Which probably means he will tell them that if I don't. I've been hesitant, because I don't want them to be afraid of me going to hell, and because I know it would be very confusing for them, and they're already dealing with the divorce situation.

How do I tell them? They have been deeply indoctrinated in Sunday School and weekly Bible classes, which they still go to. I don't think they're really at the natural questioning age yet, and I don't really want to damage their faith. 

I've been considering taking them to a Unitarian Universalist church on my weeks with them in order to help them see a different perspective, but it's tricky. I don't want to force them to do anything they don't want to with regard to faith, and I'd rather not confuse them.",parenting
"This is what I wanted, but I still feel sad","We are going through the process of having my son (4.5 yo) evaluated by the school district for special educational support- it started off because he is speech delayed and it’s snowballed into something bigger. 

We haven’t even gotten the results for all the testing he’s gone through (last two evaluations were just yesterday) and just based on the first test results in general education, he qualifies for the special pre-k program in my state. Even though he hasn’t been officially accepted, his eligibility meeting will double as his first IEP meeting and they’ve already given me the paperwork to register him for the district, which they want done ASAP. 

Looking through the paperwork last night, and reading the unofficial acceptance letter, the words hit me hard. “Your son is classified as preschool disabled.” 

This is what I wanted. This is what he NEEDS. And I thought I put to bed all those feelings of guilt, or shame, or whatever. Im sad, I’m worried-I have no prognosis, bc I don’t even have all the finding back from the evaluations. I feel like I’m swimming in a sea of questions.

"As a kid, did you ask your parents if you were their favorite?","We have a big family. Our oldest kids are in their 20s. Our youngest is just about to turn 6. The whole family is lovable toward her, but she has stayed incredibly close with me in particular. She will ask me to do things with her alone, go places by ourselves, and she sometimes whispers in my ear, ""I love you the best,"" or ""Don't tell anyone else, but you're my favorite.""

I always thank her and tell her she's my favorite little girl in the world, but last night she asked me if she was my favorite in the family. I didn't know what to say so I gave her a silly answer, ""You're my favorite in a pink coat and pink boots!"" and just kind of turned it into a joke. Knowing her personality, I'm guessing she is going to ask again and expect a straight answer. 

Growing up, I knew I wasn't a favorite, so I never had to ask. lol But that also means I don't really know how kids feel when they hear different answers. Is ""I love you all the best in different ways"" as disappointing as TV makes it sound? Is it better to tell everyone yes and let them figure out on their own that was the big secret? Do you mysteriously refuse to answer the question but make it seem like ""yes"" is the answer?

12 year old daughter is not maturing and having trouble with friends,"I have two kids, daughter 12 and son 7. They are both very intelligent, (son is WAY ahead mentally) and they are basically each others' best friends. Neither one has really made many friendships that reach beyond school. My son gets along fine with pretty much everyone, and has a few friends that we get together with and have little play dates or whatever. But my daughter has been struggling to keep the few friends she's made and keeps drifting apart from them. We see that she's not maturing in her interests like most of her friends. She's still very interested in the more childish things like playing make-believe and Pokemon and cartoons and stuff. I fear that her brother is starting to hold her back from developing socially. She's very shy and struggles to develop close friendships, and has been really hurt by losing the ones she has made in the past. And today we just learned (via the mother who we are friends with) that she's just lost another. She said that the last few times they've gotten together, they just don't have anything in common anymore and she doesn't really want to hang out with her. My daughter is going to be crushed. I plan to try to have a talk with her to see where her head is at regarding her friendships. If she's ok with it, so am I. But I'm really worried that she's starting to feel alone and isolated. It's been especially hard recently since we've gotten really close with the mother of one of my son's friends, so they come over to play and she just has nothing to do.

EDIT: I should clarify: I'm not saying there is anything WRONG with liking Pokemon and cartoons and such. I'm 40 and I still do. I'm just saying that her friends and peers are growing past those things and away from her.

I'm also not wanting to push her to ""grow up"" or change who she is. I'm mostly just concerned that she keeps losing friends and is having trouble finding new ones. I don't want her to feel isolated and alone and I want to figure out if there's anything I can do to help her if she is.

8 yo son still wets the bed,"My son is a happy and healthy 8 year old, going to be 9 at the end of the year. He wets the bed almost every night. He's managed to go a few nights without incident, but never more than a week at a time. He's also never had a problem during the day, it's strictly a nighttime issue.

I've mentioned it to his pediatrician, who assured us it is a common problem and not necessarily a symptom of an underlying illness. It's just frustrating at this point. Son is embarrassed that he still has to wear ""bedtime underwear"". He can't go to sleepovers because he's worried his friends will find out. If a friend comes to our house we have to make sure all the evidence is hidden away. It's so stressful for him and it breaks my heart.

I need to stress here, that we absolutely don't shame our son for his accidents. We know he's not doing it on purpose and have told him so. We limit drinks in the evening and use the bathroom multiple times before bed. Doesn't help. We've tried mattress pads under his sheets, thinking that if he feels the wet eventually his body will start waking up when he has the urge to go. Still nothing. We've woken him up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. Still wet come morning.

"8mo. old suddenly has zero interest in me, clings to Mom for dear life. How do I break through?","My 8mo. old daughter and I (Dad) have always had a great bond. I’ve been involved with feedings, bedtime, taking her to daycare, etc. from the start, and until recently I’ve felt like I have a great relationship with her as a result. I’ve loved my role as “Superdad” while other Dad friends have struggled to connect with their daughters at this age. While she’s always preferred my wife for comfort, she typically looks to me for play/fun, and I could always calm and comfort her too. 

All this changed about a week ago, when suddenly my daughter has become inconsolable around me and will cry non-stop unless she’s being held by Mom. She’s perfectly content at daycare and is thrilled to see me when I pick her up, but the second we get home she immediately starts crying for Mom and there’s seemingly nothing I can do to comfort her. The second Mom appears she’s all smiles and laughter again, but the minute she sets her down with me or slips out of view the waterworks begin anew. 

I love to see my daughter start to bond and play more with her Mom, but being honest it also hurts to suddenly be shut out and watching the fun from the sidelines - particularly as she’s just entering the “fun part” where she’s starting to interact and explore more. I can tell my wife is also struggling to take on more of the things that my daughter doesn’t want me involved with anymore, like bath and bedtime routines. I’m sure this is just a phase, and I’m trying my best to not be jealous, but it’s tough to not feel like I’ve been demoted to my daughter’s chauffeur. 

All this being said, I’m hoping others here have been through a similar situation and can lend some advice on how to break through this period, or at least cope with it until she comes out on the other side? Any and all tips are appreciated!",parenting

After about 10 mins of driving, during which I was touching my face, rubbing my hand through my hair, playing with my phone, and other things you absentmindedly do while driving, I catch a wiff of something weird (as I have my palm rested on my cheek, you see where this is going). I look down and there is a skid mark of brown on my hand! 

I almost wrecked my Jeep while dry heaving the rest of the way home. While driving, I had my trusty go to weapon, wet wipes, which I was rubbing anywhere I can think of that I touched and the smell still didn’t go away. 

Once I got home, it was like the scene in Ace Ventura when he finds out that Finkelstein is Einhorn. While I am showering (scrubbing the skin off my face), I start trying to figure out where the poop came from. It wasn’t mine (I hadn’t gone yet today), my daughter is potty training but as far as I know she was clean, so it must have come from one of the other Petri dish toddlers in the class. 

So I am now sitting on the couch reevaluating my life. I never thought that I would ever be hoping that it was my daughter’s shit on my face, in my hair, on my phone and clothes. I don’t think I have ever heard my wife laugh so hard when I told her the story.

I hope you all enjoyed my misery and happy Friday! Is 10 am too early to start drinking?

TLDR: Dropped my daughter off at school and unknowingly wiped an unknown assailants poop on my face, clothes, and car.

EDIT: teacher has confirmed, it was not my daughter’s. Did Mr. Hankey come early this year?",parenting
Going back to work.,"So as the title says, I'm going back to work. My daughter is 11mo old and I've been with her since the day she's been born. Her dad is going to be watching her but I'm absolutely scared of leaving her with him. He is a great dad just the only time spent with her is to play so he hasn't dealt with the tantrums or diapers etc. I'll be working 30-39hrs a week. How do you parents do it???",parenting
"Hey new here, question about a teenager."," So I'm in a weird spot that I'm really not sure what to do. My son just turned 17 and is a junior in high school. He's going through a lot of that I think I'm adult but don't want responsibility thing that teens go through. As a freshman he wanted to go to Notre Dame, a real elite school. I think he quickly realized that probably wasn't gonna happen but he still wanted to go to college....then this year started. He signed up for CTC which is career technology center, it's basically a work training program for the morning at school. He had always told us he wanted to be a mechanical engineer....but he doesn't sign up for that program, he signs up for the auto mechanic program. He likes doing stuff with cars and all that so ok...  


6 weeks later after being an overachiever at school, he is failing classes, but not just failing, dramatically failing like a 17% in a class failing. He's in advanced prep for college classes and is not even trying, last night he told us he doesn't care about his grades and we shouldn't either because he's not going to college. This came about because we got an email he needed to sign up for a test to get college credit to which he said he didn't need that.  


Nothing against auto mechanics but it's super frustrating to watch him flush every goal to the point of not even caring about passing classes anymore because of 6 weeks of a auto tech class. I just don't really know what to do here, if he wants to be a mechanic I don't want to crap on him but I also feel like what he's doing is really not acceptable either. 

We've had some issues with him over the years where he is manipulative, thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. In short he is a very poor decision maker, if anyone has any questions to help them understand anything I posted I'm more than happy to answer because I can use any advice I can get at this point.",parenting
Nanny and Parent clash??,"I am needing advice. 
So I am a 20y old female who has worked with and been around kids my entire life. I have my preschool education degree and have almost completed my special education degree as well. I taught in a preschool for three years and have seen nearly every type of behavior and child. When I was 14 I had basically raised my younger brother and my mother had a new baby. Fast forward to now I basically raised this younger younger brother as well. I have babysat and nannied since I can remember. 

I currently have this nanny position and I am struggling just a little bit on what to do. 

I have worked for this family for about 5 months now and this issue is becoming more difficult to deal with. They have 2 kids- 3year old boy  and a 1year old girl. The 3 year old had water in his ears until 1.5 yrs old so his speech is delayed- but he goes to “school” and works with speech therapists, so it is being worked on (he is making GREAT progress). 

Now, let me make it clear that I fully understand the stage that the 3 year old is in. He is into saying ‘no’ and having tantrums. I understand that is just him being a kid. 

But I arrive at 7:30 each morning. Usually he has been up since 3:30-4:00 a.m., watching TV playing the iPad when I get there. His parents are not authoritative at all. Just this morning he began to have a tantrum when his mother took the iPad away to serve breakfast. He was screaming, hitting her, spitting on her, throwing himself on the floor, the whole deal. She just let him do it. After about 20 minutes she got tired of it and took him to his room. But she stayed in there with him and bribed him to stop crying with candy and iPad time. Which is NOT AT ALL what should be done. She lets him act like that and it makes my insides burn when she is around and he acts like that. Note: he DOES NOT act like that for me. I truly feel like they as parents are push overs and do not discipline him enough. 

What do I do????

 I don’t step in when she is here because I feel that is crossing a boundary and overall, she is the parent. But I can no longer sit back and watch her and her husband allow him to act like that and then reward him just so he is quiet. 

Any serious advice will be greatly appreciated. I am at a loss on what to do.

EDIT: I want to add that this behavior is not all the time. 70% of the time he is the sweetest, silliest, most loving child I have met. I wrote this post after about 5-6 tantrums he has has the last 2 weeks with her home.",parenting
"I want to be an independent mom, but I want my daughter to have a dad...","My daughters father lives in a different state. We separated when things went downhill and he became toxic. He texts me all the time saying he wants to change for our daughter, but in reality he just wants us to go back to him so he can manipulate and control me again. I tell him if he changes he can visit with her, he says he doesn’t want to if it’s just for visits and that he wants to end his life all the time and that I’m the reason he wants to, also that I’m “killing” our daughter for not going back to him. I can’t go back to him. I can’t be hurt like that ever again. Especially not with our 4 month old daughter. He reminds me so much of my father it’s sickening. I want to be the strong independent mother my mum has always been raising 3 girls. I also want my daughter to have a dad before she grows up and wonders why she doesn’t have a dad. I’ve tried many times with her father, telling him to become a better man for our daughter, but one day he tells me it’s both of us or nothing and he’s ending his life, the next day it will be him threatening to take me to court for our daughter when he can’t even take care of himself. I’m not in the slightest scared that he would ever get custody, because he has only met her once for starters and he is a very unstable person. I have so much baggage and I’m basically starting all over, getting my life back on track. I want to be independent, but I also want to finally feel truly loved by someone and for someone to love my daughter unconditionally since I never got that growing up from my father. I know I haven’t been choosing the right guys, but also I don’t want someone to come into our lives and then things not work out a few years down the road and then there’s that attachment with that person and my daughter. I’m so afraid of her getting hurt more than me. Rant over.",parenting
Is taking away child's gadgets effective?,"Don't want to go to in depth hear as I don't know what's really relevant, but I can add more if needed later.

My wife and I have two daughters (8 and 5) who both have their own tablets and computers. They will frequently freak out, melt down and whine about anything and everything. Examples would be, ""we're going to dinner"" or ""we're going to the store"". I'm at the breaking point where I just want to take all of their electronics, toys and anything fun away from them until they learn to respect and just not throw a fit every time we try to do something as a family.

I do want to add that this is not an every time we say or ask something occurrence, but it does feel like it happens daily.

And one more addition.. They are not always on their electronics when this happens. They both live to color, draw, play with their toys and watch TV. These responses can happen during any one of these times.",parenting
Should we relocate?,"TLDR: Should my wife and I relocate our family of 4 from Indiana to California?

So my wife (31) and I (M31) live in my hometown in Indiana with our two kids (6, 8). We lived in Alabama for a time, which is where both of our kids were born, then we moved to Ecuador when they were 1 &amp; 3, then to Indiana when they were 3 &amp; 5, so they’re no strangers to moving. My parents And two of my siblings live in my hometown, but I have 3 more siblings, as well as all of my nieces (3) and my nephew in (southern) California. Should we relocate? 

My hometown (&gt;30k people)  has very few job opportunities, and I would need to drive easily 40 miles to a city big enough for a significant amount of job opportunities (as well as variety). The public schools are...typically bad. I’ve been personally connected to two people that overdosed on meth, this year alone. The weather for ~6 months of the year is very miserable and depressing. Our town is rundown and there are few opportunities for entertainment (like, we have a movie theater and once a year we have an antique car show and once a year we have a War of 1812 festival...that’s it). However, housing here is very cheap, like some of the cheapest in the nation (my nice house in a nice part of town for 2000sq ft is ~$80k). My parents And two siblings that are here are only kind of helpful as far as babysitters go.

In SoCal, I know the price of housing is ridiculous and I would likely have a long commute as well. However, it seems like there a opportunities for education, employment and entertainment like nowhere else. You’re also near the ocean, mountains and desert. We’d be starting over as we have a network here but only a very tiny one out there.

The thought of moving our kids (they don’t want to move) is heartbreaking as they’d be leaving good friends...but my hometown is a dump that offers sooo little.

Has anyone made a similar move? 

What’s your recommendation?

"I need to block my stairs with a baby gate, but only have wall on one side (pics inside). How can I do it?","[This is a pic of where I'd like to install the gate.](https://imgur.com/yMHuvTu)

As you can see, there's a wall on one side that I can screw a gate into, but the other side is just a thin (1-1.5"") metal post supporting the banister. Obviously I can't screw directly into that, and none of the other methods I can think of to attach something (e.g., tying down, adhesive) will be sturdy enough. As a result, I have no idea how to block the top of my stairs.

**Are there any products designed to block stairwells like mine?** For example, a baby gate designed to grip a thin post like in the pic (instead of needing screws...and only on one side?), or some kind of baby gate ""adapter"" I could attach to the post and screw a regular baby gate into, or just a completely different solution entirely.

Lecturing halfway round the globe is hard,"I'm (47M) in the Navy, currently stationed in Bahrain. My Ex (45F) &amp; I parent our three kids (17F, 16F, 14M) as best we can, but she handles the day to day, whereas I am but a voice on the phone for about a year now, and it'll be this way until I return home in 6 months. Even then, I won't be returning to the state their mother moved them to. This was her choice (divorcing, moving away &amp; taking the kids, my choice to then move overseas post-divorce, I allowed her to move the kids). We are amicable for the most part, but the life she wanted (old/new boyfriend, back home where she says she was happiest) didn't pan out, and I've moved on fairly well (in 2nd marriage to a woman I met after divorce). The issue is backing her up and helping manage the kids. How do I have more authority to do so when I'm just Dad on the phone, source of attaboys, attagirls, Amazon packages, and child support payer? The kids are good for the most part, but three totally different flavors of teen: moody one who lashes out at everyone and doesn't tolerate being criticized, awkward one who has body and confidence issues plus questions on orientation, and quiet, ""good"" one who feels like they are failing everyone as they move up and on in life. An example of my FB Messenger lecture today is attached below. Any advice on how to do this better?

TLDR: Need parenting advice for managing teens from halfway round the world when their mom/my ex is about to trip offline.

FB MESSENGER:
Hmmmm. A list of things I should not have to lecture my brilliant, wonderful, teenaged children about:
1. Brush your teeth.
2. Wash up. In fact, general hygiene. If you have not bathed in a couple of days, your hair will look nappy and people will justifiably criticize you. Take a shower.
3. You do not have a maid because your father is not a wall street tycoon. Wash your own clothes at lest once a week if no angel has done it for you. You are not mentally deficient. Read a tag and do laundry.  If the pile of clothes is spilling from the hamper, or your nasty butt does not use a hamper, you've already gone too long. Do a load now. No phone, no games, no TV or YouTube. Do. Your. Laundry.
4. Clean up after yourself AND OTHERS. Dishes on the table? Stuff on the floor? Looks like a bomb struck East Providence? Pick it up, return it to its rightful place, tidy it / wash it, and put it away? Not yours? Who cares!? Do it! This world gets better when we do more than just look after ourselves. Be part of a better world!
5. Time to get Biblical: HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER. Your moms is at her goddamn breaking point. Do you love her? Do you want her going to FB and Insta saying how beat up she is? THEN STOP ACTING LIKE SELFISH LITTLE SAVAGES, SWALLOW YOUR TEENAGED LAZY REBELLION, AND REMEMBER THAT YOU OWE HER RESPECT. Please, I LOVE my kiddos. Honor that by being good and help a mom out, okay? No more of this selfish laziness and not taking care of yourselves.",parenting
Baby throws self backwards/arches back aggressively?,"Anyone else’s child or children arch their back when they don’t get what they want? My baby (12 months) has always done this when it’s time to sleep. Unless I am standing bouncing or she’s in her car seat (only because she physically can’t, I’ve seen her attempt it here) violently arches/cries screams until she gets what she wants which is me standing and bouncing. Then she completely relaxes and goes to sleep within about 10 minutes. This is taking a toll on me. I’m at the point where I want to sleep train for her safety but with her being so aggressive I’m scared she’s going to hurt herself in the crib. She mainly does this when she knows she is safe (in my arms or on a soft surface) but still I can’t always catch her/she’s not completely aware of her surroundings and I’m just so scared she’s going to seriously injure herself.  Like cribs rails, she might still throw herself against them thinking she is safe when she is not. She doesn’t really do this at other times when she doesn’t get what she wants, mainly sleep. Every once in awhile she will do it for something else. 

TL;DR does anyone have children who violently arch and throw their head back when they don’t get what they want?",parenting
Speech problem with 9 yr old,"My (49M) youngest son (9M) has problems with speech. At least, that's what I think.

He has had several issues ever since he started speaking.

He doesn't pronounce words the way they should be. He speaks either too softly, too loud or too fast. He even sometimes makes up his own words for things.

He has an older brother and sister. Since he started speaking, nobody has had trouble understanding him. Everyone knew what he meant and never tried to correct him. Except me.

Me and his mom took him to a speech therapist and she worked a miracle. His speech greatly improved. It's also not a dental problem.

The issue I'm dealing with is this: somehow nobody seems to care about his speech! No matter what he says, he knows we understand him, so he really doesn't put in any effort to continue his new way of speaking and he's back to where he was, sometimes even worst. It's not normal to have a conversation with a 9 yr old and really have to concentrate to be able to understand him.

I know he's young, but he's about to reach that age where kids are going to judge him by it and/or make fun of him. Kids can be cruel. I also don't want him to lose his confidence. It worries me that the longer he keeps this up, the harder it will be to retrain his speech mechanisms. He's a great kid and deserves a great life.

I feel so alone in my effort to help him. His teacher doesn't see the problem, his class mates don't, his siblings don't, my ex doesn't. Only me and sometimes it makes me feel like the asshole.

I try to help him by asking him to slow down, speak up, speak more clearly, etc. All in a very respectful and relaxed way. I don't want to make this a huge issue for him. 

Any advice?",parenting
In need of some advice,"Our son is 2yrs old. We just started using a toddler bed. The bed is a hand me down and it’s one where it has a slide and a little area to play under. He loves it—-in the daytime. It’s a metal bed frame and it does squeak a bit. This is where the issue comes in. To put my son to sleep, I lay with him until he’s out and then I leave. That works out fine. It’s when he wakes up at 12 or 1am that’s the issue. We do the same thing, lay with him until he’s asleep. Coming out of bed, the squeaks constantly wake him up and he starts crying because he knows we’re trying to leave. We’ve tried letting him cry just a little when he wakes up initially, to see if he’ll fall back asleep. We go in when his cries intensify. We live in an apartment and don’t want to wake up the whole complex with his cries. We try night light. We try teddy bears. We’ve tried changing bed times to make sure he won’t wake up in the middle of the night to begin with. We have bedtime rituals that we stick to. Nothing has worked so far. I know that by laying with him, we are creating sleep associations, but he just won’t stay by himself. He’ll cry and cry and cry. Is there another technique I can try to get him to fall asleep?

His energy levels are fine and he has no fever and his appetite is fine as well. Does anyone have any similar stories of toddlers that have colds that just don’t seem to quit?

Thanks to my MIL my 2-year-old is nearly potty trained!,"I always see these posts about people having negative experiences with their MILs which is pretty sad. I feel like I have a pretty good relationship with my MIL and I’m glad about that.

Anyways, I’m pregnant with my fourth and having a really hard time. I have a 4-year old, a 2-year old and a 1-year old (yeah I’m crazy I guess). So to give us a break she offered to take our 2-year old daughter for a week. She is the most difficult of my three kids. She screams at me at the top of her lungs like almost all the time. Hits me. She just doesn’t seem to understand the word NO unless she is the one saying it. She is DIFFICULT. I was so happy for the break!

My 4-year old is fully potty trained except for the wiping part I have to help her with if she poops. And I had no idea how to start with my second. When she came back on Sunday though my MIL told me about her potty training and everything and I don’t know what happened but my daughter came back a different person! Not only will she tell me (most of the time) when she needs to go potty (usually she knows when she needs to poop. Sometimes she will pee too) but she can say certain words clearer and get her point across without screaming at me.. she still attacks me and screams at me. But she just seems like she is more in charge and able to understand. I don’t know if it’s just the potty training or the way my MIL took care of her? Or maybe she just needed a break from me and her siblings? But I am SO THANKFUL we have family that is willing to do things like that for us and I am so proud of my little girl going potty!

Problems with School,"Hey everyone - back again. I don't have a link for my previous post. The issues that we were having with my six year old have mostly resolved, I'm happy to say. 

Here's what's going on now: 
My six year old son is very social and likes to talk. We're working with him on not talking out of turn and not talking while his teacher talks. She's moved his seat, but the kid has never met a stranger and will happily make friends with anyone. He hasn't come up for air since he learned how to talk. 

Since he started kindergarten, I've been really side-eyeing how they do things (I do have a degree in education, so I'm not completely uninformed). He mostly has good days where his ""clip"" isn't moved at all - or is moved once at most. However, he's had a rough few days this week. His teacher has kept him out of PE several times for talking too much in class, which I feel is extremely counterintuitive considering it's really the only time of day these kids get to be physically active and burn off some energy. Outside of PE, they have 30 minutes allotted for recess which is folded into nap time, and if they take too long to eat their snacls (right before recess which also has me asking questions), then they lose time at recess. 

I've spoken to the teacher regarding my concerns about this. I teach his Sunday school class, and between that and having him at home, we've noticed that he does a better job of listening, staying quiet, and following directions when he's had time to go run around and expend some energy. Still, though, she takes PE away and things get worse throughout the day (shocking, I know). 

Today, his clip was moved twice for excessive talking. He and two other boys in his class were sent to see the principal who told them that if he heard them getting in trouble for this again, that he would ""bring the paddle"". Now, I'm in Alabama. I was raised in Texas. I knew that some places still had corporal punishment, but in every school district I've worked in, parents were required to opt into that if that's a discipline option that they're ok with. My husbamd and I are 100% not ok with this (especially used as a punishment for talking). What's worse is that one of our friends is a police officer and he warned us this afternoon as we were talking to him and his wife that in Alabama, they can paddle once without parental permission. 

At no point during the year have we gotten a phone call or text expressing concern. We just get a note on the back of his folder that says how many times his clip was moved and the reason. Today is said ""talk to principal"" with his transgressions listed (excessive talking) and no other information. We've spoken to the teacher numerous times, and we're still dealing with the same issues and have the same concerns. Now I'm concerned that since the principal is telling kids that they're going to be paddled for talking too much that this is a top down problem that likely won't be resolved by moving to another classroom. 

That said, we're very seriously considering taking him out and homeschooling for the remainder of the year until we move in May. Thoughts? Has anyone else experienced something similar?",parenting
Night problems with my 22mo son. Please help,"I’m father of a 22mo child that never slept well. Nowadays he wakes up once or twice per night crying and shouting until one of us arrive. We live in a two floor apartment and his room is upstairs, so when he wakes up like this he wants two things before relaxing and sleeping again: to come downstairs (normally two three minutes is enough) and to drink a bottle of milk. After this he relaxes and sleeps again. We always wait in the side of his bed until he fall asleep, if he feels we are leaving the room he starts crying and shouting again. I have been reading here and in other places about leaving him crying until he stops himself and sleeps again, as a training to understand that night is for sleeping. I’m more and more convinced that this is the way, however my SO refuses to do it because she doesn’t want that he feels unattended. So here I ask you for some advice. What can we do to reconduce the problem? In case cry out is the solution, how can I convince my SO to do it and don’t “sabotage” the plan?

Son just turned 6 last week and has legit BO.,"We’ve had a hot week where I live and I’ve noticed my sweet kindergartener has body odor - not stinky feet or whatever but legit armpit BO.

I remember that I (a female) began to get bo in first grade. And didn’t get my period until a few weeks before my 13th birthday. So hopefully it can be normal?

He is a fairly tall/heavy kid - I believe like 54lbs and 49.5 inches. He has only grown half an inch tops since last March, too. 

He has his 6 year well child visit next week so I’ll mention it then. Hopefully it’s nothing of concern. Thanks for reading and letting me know if this is a legit thing to be concerned about or not. :)",parenting

I'm at my wits end,"I'm the mommy of an awesome, funny, kind, energetic 3.5 year old boy. He is so much fun, and I get such a kick out of being his mom. 

BUT

Every day, I take him to his pre-school, and I have an overwhelming stress and sense of dread come over me. Because I know that either when I drop him off, when I pick him up, or BOTH....his teacher will pull me aside to talk to me about what he did that day/the day before. 

Mostly, he does little things. His school is very curriculum-based, and they don't have a lot of outside time. While they're supposed to be sitting at the tables and practicing writing or whatever...he likes to get up and run around in circles. They tell him to stop running, and he....doesn't. He sometimes throws books, or other things. And in general, he's just not listening. 

I've tried talking to him. Reasoning with him, taking toys away, promising toys if he behaves. I've even suggested he hang out with the kids in the class that aren't getting into trouble (some of it is influence from other kids). Nothing helps. I've thought of taking him out of the school to go to another one (we both work, so staying home isn't an option). My husband isn't a fan of that solution, and tells me to just tell the teacher to tell me something positive, and just email me the negative. But, she railroads me and I'm not good at asserting myself. 

I worry about how this is impacting him, hearing the teacher give me the laundry list every day. But I don't know what to do...",parenting
TIFU by punishing my daughter even though she did what I wanted,"(TLDR at the bottom)

I have a 3 year old daughter, and like most toddlers, has issues with listening.  She's not horrible by any means, but she's a toddler.  We've been getting a bit stricter about enforcing consequences for not listening i.e. usually if we do A then B then C and she won't listen and do B, then C doesn't happen.

So our normal bed time routine is PJ's, read 3 books while drinking a bit of milk, and then bed.  Lately we've been reading books in our room.  While I was getting her three month old brother (who decided to not sleep last night so I am functioning off of maybe 3 hours of sleep) ready for bed I asked her to go up to her room and get three books to read.  She didn't listen and climbed on the bed instead, so I again tell her to go get the books.  She goes up to her room to get them.  I'm trying to get her brother's PJs on and he's screaming and crying, and then I hear HER crying.  She comes down without books, and upset that her necklaces are all tangled up.  Today was one of those days where she was just being very emotional and crying over nothing, so by bed time it was getting on my nerves.

I calm her down and tell her again to go up and get her books.  While she goes to get the books I go to get a couple things from the kitchen.  I hear her crying again, and she comes to me and is crying because now she can't find a ring that she has, and she needs this, and she needs that... etc... etc...  Finally I get her back upstairs to our room and ask if she brought down the books.  All she brought down is a little fabric box with a bunch of her toys in it.

I had it.  That was it.  I asked her three times to get her @(\*@\*#\* books and she didn't do it. I just ran out of patience. So no books.  Straight to bed.   Of course, that caused a huge meltdown.  Got her in bed,  and she looks devastated.  I went into my room to pick up the box and as I do, the toys shift a bit and I can now see the darn books at the bottom of it.  She wanted to bring some toys down too so she had grabbed a box, put her books in it, and then some toys.  But I didn't see the books because the toys were in the way. F. Me.

Cue the guilty walk back up the stairs and a loooong apology.

The kicker:  We reset and do the normal bed time routine.  As I'm tucking her in she says ""wait wait.  I left my toys on the floor.  I need to pick them up.  I'm sorry I left them on the floor.  I shouldn't have done that.  I'm sorry""  she picked up her toys and went to bed.  I give her a hug &amp; kiss and leave the room only to hear her politely calling for me again.  She wanted just ""one more hug and kiss because I love you"".  God darnit kid... you really know how to pull at my heart strings.

TLDR: I f'd up because I thought my daughter didn't get her bedtime books like I had repeatedly asked her to, so I sent her to bed without reading any, causing her to have a meltdown.  Only to later find out that she had in fact done what I had asked - I just hadn't noticed.  She then said some very sweet things that made me feel even more guilty than I already did.",parenting
Insecurities that hinder me,"After my son was born, I developed an inverted nipple, which made it impossible for him to latch on the left side.

Did my kids teacher cross the line,"My second grader has ADHD. A couple of days ago he forgot his name on his paper and his consequence was he had to write his name 50 times and when he was done the teacher crumpled/ripped the paper up in front of him and threw it away.

He came home and acted out severely that day, and we didn't know why, and it finally came out tonight.

Her standard consequence for forgetting your name is that, and goes up 50 times each time you forget. To me this doesn't seem age appropriate.

**Edit: Asking because I want to make sure I'm not being a millennial snowflake hellilawnmower parent.**

**Edit 2: My wife went and talked to the principal today (new principal this year), and we were told we had to try to solve this with the teacher first. However, there have been more parents that we've talked to that had a similar experience over multiple years and haven't been able to solve it. I feel quite unsupported. So I guess its time to get a formal accommodation plan in place, so if it continues I at least have some legal standing if we have to switch schools and they try to continue to charge us tuition. My big fear is putting a plan in place will cause him to be treated differently in a negative way.**",parenting
Toddler bed,"What age did you get your LO into a toddler bed? My son is 2 and everyone is telling me that he's overdue to be in.

School called us out to talk about our child (7/M) behavior on Monday; it doesn't look good,"First some background: last summer we decided that our seven-years-old boy was not going back to the public school he was assigned to for various reasons; overcrowded, he wasn't learning much and he was constantly scare of a pack of bullies that apparently the school could do nothing about.   He was really unhappy and told us about it and luckily we got a spot for him in a local private school.

The first couple of weeks didn't go really well, as he was called out a couple of times for misbehavior and play-fighting; that was really bad for us, but more for his mom who was afraid that he was going to be spelled.  We had a meeting with the school counselor and explained our son background and the issues he had at his last school and pleaded with them for patience and to give us some time for him to adjust.

We had serious conversation with our kid and made him understand that if he liked the new school (he did) he had to do something about that; we basically spent half a weekend talking and explaining the situation to him and he seemed to get it.  For the last few weeks he was the model student, doing all his assignments and following the teachers instructions.  However, today he had a ""relapse"" to his bad boy behavior that involved throwing some object that ended up  hitting another kid after being told specifically not to do that.

My understanding (given that I was told all this by his mom) is that they spoke with him and told him that this was unacceptable, but he ended up the rest of the school activities without any more incidents.  They also told us that they want to talk to us on Monday on a meeting with the teacher, two counselor and the school director to discuss ""what's going to happen next"".  

I fear the worst, that they're going to kick our kid out of school as they've been very adamant that physical contact of any kind with other students is ground for expulsion.  I understand their situation, they have a reputation to uphold and they are very strict when it comes to unruly students who put the safety of others at risk even if not intentional.

I really don't know how to approach this with them as they already gave us an opportunity and our kid seemed to be doing so well until today.  I of course will speak on behalf of my son; his mom (we separated a few years ago) if more combative and already told me that she will let me do most of the talking as she's afraid that she might become very emotional advocating for our child.   

I really need any advice that you can give me about this; like I said, until today the kid was doing really well and I'm not saying that the school is very strict (my ex seems to thing so) but is it reasonable for us to ask them for a litter more time given the issues he had at his last school?  My ex seems to believe that this is it, that they're going to expel him.  Another thing, the kid started counseling a couple of weeks ago regarding his conduct but at the moment the counselors don't have much to tell us that we can use to get him to change his behavior.",parenting
Independent baby...,"My baby girl is a year and a half and is refusing to eat anything she can't pick up and feed herself with...She will eat porridge, she has done so for every meal, for about four days.

I have tried her with home made (hm) soup and bread, she will dip the bread and eat it, leave the rest of the soup once the bread is finished. (hm) spag bol, cheesy pasta, stir fry, cottage pie etc. She just won't eat now unless it's porridge... She will eat all her snacks (banana, pear, grapes, chicken bites, quavers) which she gets if she eats her meals, which recently has been porridge... Can anyone give advice?

ADHD 8yr old,"I'm sobbing. My 8yr old was recently diagnosed with ADHD after a yearlong journey to rule everything else out. His teachers and I are out of ideas. He is on prozac for anxiety, clonidine for impulse control, and was on ritalin for his adhd but his doc took him off it and upped the prozac because we weren't seeing any results. 
He is disruptive in class, argumentative, always bouncing around and making sounds. His teacher has to separate him from other kids to prevent him distracting them, and they have tried so many things at school as well as us at home. I don't know what to do, I'm constantly getting updates from his teacher (I asked her for communication) and it's always what a difficult day he had at school. He has a psychiatrist appointment in a few weeks, but that's WEEKS more of this and it impacting him academically and socially. I can't take him to the doctor for a cast, or put a bandaid on, or give him tylenol. This isn't something Mommy and Daddy can just fix for him, and it's tearing me apart. Then add to that what my son is dealing with from it all....

Toddler boy suddenly hitting only Mom,"Hi! 
My son is almost two and a half. At the start of the week he started hitting me when he wants my attention or when I’m not doing what he wants. I keep reading that this is normal, but it has just got me so depressed. I am trying my best to hide it from him and react firmly but dispassionately- not letting him hit me and telling him “we don’t hit. It hurts me when you hit me.” But it doesn’t seem to have any lasting effect. 
He has always been so attached to me, but now I feel like he is trying to tell me with his actions he does not like me. I feel like I must have failed, I’ve never hit him nor has he seen an adult hit anyone else. He only hit ME, not his dad, not anyone else. I am home with him all day, so how could he feel ignored? I cannot see anything I’ve done to deserve being treated this way.",parenting

Mean kid from class is coming to my son’s bday party,"At the beginning of the school year, my 6 y/o (1st grade) started telling us about a girl in his class being rude to him. He is not the type to “tattle” and never has anything negative to say about classmates. So we knew this stuff was really bothering him. It didn’t seem too serious - no bullying or violence or anything like that, just unnecessary attitude from this kid. It sounded like she just really dislikes him. 

We invited all his classmates to his bday party. He just told us another story about her being mean to him when they were doing a math game as a pair and stealing points from him, a few days ago. Today I got a text from her mom, asking if it’s too late to RSVP to the party and said her daughter just now showed her the invite. (The party is in 3 days.)

I said that’s fine, because what else could I say? I talked to him about it and he seemed surprised that she wants to come, and a little bothered by it. I told him I would keep an eye out and call her mom if anything happens. Just wondering if anyone has had an experience like this, and maybe has advice for how I can handle it if an issue arises.",parenting
Is there a point where a grandparents relationship is not as important as safety?,"My mother in law is in question. She is a fan of “let them do what they want”. I do appreciate the freedom allowed there. I’ve gotten over how bad they are when they come back home and have to follow rules again (It’s always short lived). 

But they come home hurt. She’s let my 2yo fall off of so many things and come home with busted lips and black eyes. She’s let my 1yo fall down the stairs off her porch onto pavement and come home with busted lips and huge bumps on his head. 

She leaves change sitting around for anyone to choke on. 

She argues with me over time to leave. 

She completely disregards any kind of healthy diet (constantly telling my long, skinny kid that she is too skinny when everyone on my side of the family is long and skinny. Her weight is perfectly average according to the doctor)

The list really goes on and on but I can look past all of this (begrudgingly) because I didn’t have grandparents growing up. I love how much my kids love this woman. (And my parents but I don’t have these problems with them. They show respect for my rules). 

The kicker happened earlier today. MIL let my 2yo fall off the front of one of those handicap scooters (runs pretty fast) with a stick in her hand which in turn stabbed her in the cheek! 3 inches up and I would be at the hospital tonight dealing with a stick in the eyeball! 

Anything I say to this woman is asking too much. Even if it is something stupid like “don’t let my kid ride on a scooter with a stick in her hand”! I don’t mind them falling over and getting bumps and bruises, but these things just don’t seem to happen when other people are watching my kids! 

So, community full of people who understand grandparents better than I do... am I overreacting?",parenting
I found out my 16f daughter has been dating a 25m for a year,"My daughter had been acting a little weird for the past few months, hygiene was poor, angry outburst, lack of enthusiasm for things she loved, unhealthy habits, etc. So I decided to bring her to the doctor to see what’s up.  Apparently she has been seeing a 25yo man for a whole year and it was beginning to eat away at her.  They had met on some app called “Whisper” where you can post anonymously.  He drove almost 400 miles every few months to come see her and them two had  sex every time.  

On the days she was so called “at work”, she was going around with him.  He made a pretty big impact on her, in text logs they talked almost daily , and they were planning to move out of state once she graduated. She’s pretty brainwashed with the whole situation and keeps saying she had a future with him.  He groomed her too much saying sweet things like they’ll have a beautiful family and that she could get away from me and start a whole new life.  I have found that he had also  bought her gifts such as teddy bears, candies, clothes,  makeup, etc. She acts pretty in love with him and looks heartbroken. I don’t know what to do or say, they had been seeing each other constantly  and she has grew attached to him. I have set her up with weekly therapist to help her out with her struggles that she’s facing, just somebody she could talk to weekly but I’m not sure if its helping.   I have also tried talking to her, encouraged her to maybe write down her feelings or we could take a few days off of school to spend time together, etc. 

I’m not sure how I could move forward with this, the age of consent 16 in our state, I have talked to law enforcement  but they all say some same  the bullshit .  I wish i could put this thing to an end, I hate seeing her in pain and want her to grow and become better. I have banned cell phone use from her and closely monitor what she does now as a precaution.

My child is out of control and I just want to get her some help,"My daughter is five and has what we're pretty sure is severe ADHD. I spoke with her pediatrician before the school year started because of the behavior concerns. She was talking incessantly, refusing to do tasks, and complained that when she wasn't running around her legs hurt. She wasn't unmanageable and we could mostly manage her behavior through positive reinforcement and the occasional loss of privileges. 
The doctor said the school would handle my daughter's assessment for ADHD. Good to hear. Well school started and my daughter became very aggressive and started having major meltdowns. It got so bad that she got kicked off the school bus to the charter school she was attending and I couldn't drive her. So we disenrolled her from that school and put her into the school that is easy walking distance from our apartment. 
 The same problems are happening at this school, but now her behaviors are escalating at home. She has these meltdowns and says really mean things to me. She throws things and yells and is just generally really rude and cruel to me. I've tried various forms of discipline but nothing really works. The only thing that has even a little bit of success is taking away her screen time, but then when she does get screen time it makes her behavior so much worse. 
 Her behavior at school is shocking. She's been violent, and tries to get the other kids into trouble, even going so far as to give herself a paper cut and blame it on a boy who upset her. She has meltdowns when there are loud noises and tries to eat foods she knows she's allergic to. I'm scared for her. They said we would have a meeting with the health and wellness team this week, which I was looking forward to because it seemed like something may finally be done for her, but it never happened.
  I've got her on the list for behavioral health services, but they're saying it's going to be eight weeks before they have an appointment available. With things escalating the way that they are I'm at a loss of what to do. My mom says this is just the way kids are so she's no help. Our friends don't always like being around us because of the way my daughter behaves. It's so incredibly frustrating. I guess I'm just looking for advice. I'm at the end of my rope here.",parenting

I went to take a picture of the setup they had and I turned around and she had 1 in her hand. I said ""what did we just talk about"" quite a bit above speaking volume but not quite a yell. She broke down in tears and said ""I dont want to see you anymore. I want to go back to mommy's"" she then followed that with I dont want to visit you anymore. Her mother is very easy going g and has almost no rules and let's her get away with a lot. I'm sure some of you have been there before. How would you handle this.

Nighttime car journeys and fear of the dark,"My 11mo doesn't seem to have any issues with car journeys in the daytime, the struggle to get her in the car seat in minimal the majority of the time, but nighttime is a totally different ball game.

Admittedly our journeys have been short so far (20 mins) but winter nights are drawing in and we will be driving in the dark more frequently - especially with visiting family during the Christmas period.

Tonight we tried leaving a torch on in the back seat to see if that would help - it didn't.  She was fine as soon as we stopped and got her out of the car.

I'm not sure if this is an actual type of post-partum. I'm severely over-attached to my daughter.,"My daughter is almost 6 months old. I co-sleep and nurse her to sleep for naps and bedtime. Up until about 3 months I let her sleep on me, for naps and bedtime. We stopped because she was ready, as in she'd get fussy. I tried putting her down and she stopped. 

Now, she's at that 6 month mark where doctors say you can (and should) start sleep training. I get nothing done, hardly any cleaning and any freetime is spent on school work...which isn't much. In short, I need her to sleep on her own so I can get daily life stuff done.

The problem is I have the attachment.  Everyone says just put her down, she wont remember, it needs to be done for her health. The thing is I still remember crying myself to sleep at night. I was old enough to remember and remember feeling unloved. I cant read my baby's mind, but if I felt that way there's a good chance she's feeling the same way but has no way to express herself or tell me.  This is what makes me question post partum because I'll do anything to just keep her happy even though I'm a complete mess and barely holding myself together.

I've had plenty advice from people who put their baby down from day one.  I'm looking for advice from those who can relate.  I know its unhealthy for my baby and myself to be so depend on each other. I know she's not going to die, I know she's not going to remember. But I do.",parenting

Girlfriend's child is extremely difficult. Have to pick up at school all the time. What can we do?,"I've been with my girlfriend for about a year. She has two children, one is 7 the other is 6. Let's call the 7 year old Billy.

Billy likes to be violent. He loves not listening and doing whatever he wants to do. He has a very hard time keeping his hands off of people and treats his teachers with complete disrespect to the point of possible harm.

I've tried working with him in every way I can think how. He's currently on 4 medications because of this. Now before I get anyone commenting about over medicating, if he's not on the medicine he's 1,000 times worse. To the point of being uncontrollable at home.

When he's at home and I'm there, he's usually fine. When I'm not there he does the same stuff to his mother that he does at school. His mother is a very non-disciplinarian when it comes to her kids. She was brought up in a home where violence was commonplace, she hates to discipline her children but will do it if the event is extreme. I've tried to help her become stronger when it comes to her children, but this usually ends in a fight about her skills as a parent.

When we discipline we do not spank, we only talk to take things away. He has a corner he sits in when he's bad. 

He has a child psychiatrist that he goes to every couple of weeks. But when he's there he does none of these things. He also does not respond truthfully. He lies constantly there and at home. We've shown the psychiatrist the reports from school to which he stated we should start involving religion. We are not religious people and do not believe this will help in any way as he wouldn't care one way or the other.

We're at a loss as to what to do anymore. The school calls us daily because he's being terrible to other students or staff. When we get on the phone with him he usually calms down the rest of the day. But, sometimes we have to go pick him up. It's to the point where our jobs are at stake because of it. We do not have the money to put him in martial arts or sports as I believe that would help the situation.

We've read every article, every book on difficult kids and all of the suggestions are the same. Talk to him, make things he can get if he's good, put up a chart for days he's bad/good, etc. None of this works. Talking to him does nothing. He says he understands but then goes right back to being violent and/or angry. 

His biological father had some major issues with violence. He went to jail because he beat up my girlfriend with Billy in the room. I believe genetics and/or seeing this has something to do with the problem.

We're out of options. We have no idea what we can do. We cannot survive if we're leaving work every single day to go and get him. The school has him in special ed, but the teachers at this new school cannot control him. 

My girlfriend and I's relationship is very strained because of this. I care for both her kids and I want them to succeed. But at this point I'm completely out of ideas.

If anyone has any advice, I'm all ears. Thank you.",parenting
Is it possible my breast milk is no longer enough?,"Hi everyone!

So after 2 weeks of sleepless nights,  I decided someone here might have good tips :-)

Our 6 months baby was never ""good"" with sleep. We had to battle every nap, and each nap was no longer than 40 minutes (exactly one sleep cycle). It looks like his always over stimulated because his very curious and if there is something to look at, he will. So most of the time they go him to sleep, we had to put some sort of blanket on his eyes or else he won't close his eyes. We got to an OK spot where we would sleep 2-3 hours between the time when he wakes up to the night sleep (and those also require fighting him). The night sleep would be feed (breast feeding) -&gt; 5-6 hours of sleep -&gt; feed time again -&gt; 4 hours before his hungry again. 

It was far from perfect (it seems like everyone around me has sleeping babies), but it worked :-) But something changed two weeks ago. Where previously he was able move between one cycle to another (most cycles anyway) he know wakes up every 1 cycle (40 minutes ) or two cycles. He won't get back to sleep, unless rocked or fed. 

I was checking online and read about the 6 months feeding growth sprout that takes a week. So I went diving down into it, feeding him more often. It just it's already 2 weeks now, and it's not improved - and it seems worse.  The baby will now won't go to sleep in his normal hours in the evening, and will be very crunky. He will cry when put on his cry, cry when I hold him on sleep position, cry when he enter his room even. But when taken to the living room - looks all smily and happy. So I'm not sure it's a medical problem and the Doctors says the same. It's like he refuse to go to sleep. And I know his very tired because he keep pulling his ears and itching eyes. We tried to sleep training (we avoid it because it used to work without it) and this only makes him hysterical. After 10 minutes of sleeping, his all out of air, and screaming/shaking in crisis. His taken it so hard, It's take me couple of minutes to snap him out of it even on my hands. So I'm trying to avoid it for now (or maybe I shouldn't?).

In the last 2-3 days he started to moan and cry on my breast. This was the only thing that was ALWAYS make him relaxed and sleepy. Like his being bothered. I'm starting to think that after 6 months breast milk is not enough for him. His very tall, and weight around 9 Kg (19.8 pounds). We started a week ago with solid food, but only for testing allergies, so it's not big portions.  Maybe it's time to mix in formula?",parenting
My son never takes naps,"My son is 4 years old &amp; just never wants to nap. I have no clue why &amp; I've tried everything.

Obviously we don't have the time to lay there with him till he falls asleep &amp; the rare times he did take his nap he would go to sleep at night late &amp; some how still manage to wake up early. 

We pretty much gave up trying. Now that he started pre k its being an issue now cause he doesn't take naps in school &amp; ends up being cranky sometimes due to tiredness. I'm trying to get him use to naps &amp; its still the same story, he just doesn't fall asleep. Just lays there with his eyes open the whole time. Sometimes he does fall asleep but majority no.

He's not asking for anything unreasonable, I'm just not encouraging books or playtime, or sticking much to schedules... I'm just hanging out, waiting for him to tell me he's hungry before I get him food, then doing the bare minimum and getting back to my phone or whatever I was doing at the moment. I usually get baby as soon as I hear he's awake over the monitor, but I've been leaving him in his crib chatting to himself and only getting him when he starts actually crying.

I just don't feel like playing and interacting.

My husband and I JUST took a mini vacation last weekend... We got a hotel room while my mom hosted a grandma sleepover with all 4 boys from 10a Saturday to 6p Sunday... So practically two days off. Other than the movie and a dinner date, we just spent the rest of the the time lounging in the hotel room. So I feel particularly guilty for feeling so burnt out and lazy right now.

8yo is making up stories about things he’s doing on minecraft. Not sure why or if I should be worried,"My son (like most kids) loves minecraft and plays and watches mine craft YouTube.

Recently he got his own tablet and since then he’s started to tell me stories about how he and his friend is a hacker (like, sure!) and about things that happens where they play together online and other hackers, like hero Brian, join in. He plays pocket edition and I’m not worried about him really being a hacker. He doesn’t even know how to get someone in his game that isn’t LAN connected and has definitely never played with this friend online. I also monitor his usage and which channels he watches. 

What concerns me is that he’s very insistent that it’s real. I talked to his friend’s mum about it to see if it was maybe a game they were playing at school, but from what he said it doesn’t seem like it is. 

Should I be concerned my son is making up stories like this now he’s 8? He did this when he was 4 and it was cute and understandable, but I feel he should be past that part of his life now.

ETA: 

I also want to mention... he just got a diagnosis of DCD. Part of me thinks he might be autistic though. 

I work with autistic kids and I see them do this imagination but it’s all real stories all the time.  I don’t feel like many of the other NT kids I’ve known this age tell stories like this. 

But I’m also very aware that now I spend most my time with ASD kids that I might have lost a bit of baring for what NT kids are always like. And wanted a parent perspective on of this kind of story telling is still “normal”.

I think I’ve confused it a little by adding the hacker aspect. But it isn’t a concern.",parenting
My son is having a terrible time in school again this year. Administration is half the problem and it’s breaking my heart,"Any advice is welcome and most appreciated. My son is 7 and in second grade. 

The basic issues are this. The administration consistently tells students not to tattle, so my child never feels comfortable asking for help when he needs it. He gets bullied or pestered with no one intervening, then finally snaps and is punished for it. Then to top it off, other children tattle and he’s punished for whatever stupid little thing he’s ratted out for. Their idea of a good consequence is in school suspension where he sits in the office alone all day. Great way to teach a lesson. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I can’t stand another day of my baby coming home in tears. Or crying when trying to tell me what happened at school that day. I feel like the adults are being lazy and have no empathy for the children. It’s more important to them to be left alone and not be bothered than it is to take a stand against bullying and make school a safe place for the students. 

If you want specific examples I will add an edit. I left them out for fear of going on a total rant.",parenting

Daughter has back pain when sitting in the car. We're at the end of our ropes. Any ideas?,"I'm wondering if anyone else here has ran into this issue and found a solution.

Our daughter, who is 5, cannot be in the car for more than about 20 minutes without getting major back pain... like yelling and crying pain. This coming from a girl who is usually very mellow tells us that she's not faking it.

We have tried everything we can think of. New car seat, booster seat, pillows and blankets for extra cushioning, foot rest, dramamine, eating before we drive, fasting before we drive... We've taken her to multiple doctors and done multiple physicals and none of them have found anything wrong. She doesn't have this pain when sitting in a chair at home or at school. We are completely out of ideas. Any help would be much appreciated.",parenting
Babysitting horror story,"Background- my babysitter, Laura (\*not real name and throwaway account) has been babysitting my now 5 year old son since he was 1. I have never had any concern that she was anything less than great with the kids. When I had my now 8 month old daughter it was no question that both the kids would be going to the same babysitter. Over the past 8 months, Laura and I have gotten much closer than our previous babysitter/mom relationship and became best friends. Our husbands also became best friends and we all spent a lot of time together with my kids and her kids.

About six weeks ago my husband was picking our kids up and noticed our daughter was acting funny... pale in the face, staring, no facial reaction when he came in. He immediately brought her to me at work ( i work just down the street from the sitters) to get my opinion. I agreed that she wasn't acting normal and called the doctor's on call line. She had just got her vaccines two days prior and my initial thought was that it could be a bad reaction to something. The doctor said her behavior was concerning and to bring her to the ER. 

While there, Laura called me and immediately began crying saying that she had an accident and that she was carrying my daughter and another boy, about one year old, down the stairs at the same time and the one year old began messing her hair and face and she lost her grip on my daughter and dropped her down the stairs (this was right before my husband came to pick them up). She apologized profusely for not telling us right away but she was scared we would hate her and not want to be friends anymore etc etc. She said at first our daughter acted normal and then started to become more out of it closer to the time my husband went to pick them up. Initially, I was very angry. but I forgave her for not telling me right away, but ultimately decided  to pull the kids from her care. 

That night in the hospital, the doctor looked my daughter over, and said because there was no bruising and she was acting closer to her normal personality they didn't want to expose her to the radiation and sent us home without doing any xray or CT scans. Two days after this my daughter had a seizure and then went unconscious. After a CT scan, we find out she had internal bleeding in her head caused by the fall and we stayed at the hospital with her for the weekend.  


We THEN later find out that she also had bilateral retinal hemorrhaging  (via her discharge paperwork, the doctors for whatever reason didn't think it was necessary to share with her parents). This hemorrhaging is almost always seen with babies that have Shaken Baby Syndrome. It is possible to be seen with other cases of head trauma, but most often is a sign of abuse. Obviously CPS is involved and has been looking into the sitter. She has not once changed her story or made it seem like she was lying. But has more recently began to act very differently, especially towards my daughter.  But i am truly at a loss. I can't continue to be friends with someone who may have given my daughter Shaken Baby Syndrome but i have no way to know if she was lying unless she admits to it. It also puts my husband in a very difficult position because he is such close friends with her husband. If we still had a normal babysitter/ mom relationship this wouldn't even be an issue since the kids no longer go to her, but because we have gotten so close, cutting off all contact seems extreme if this really was just an accident. Any advice on how to move forward would be helpful and appreciated!",parenting
My son's girlfriend wants to come and live with me.,"My son Danny is 14. He lived with me up until the age of 11 until he went to live with his father. His dad is from quite a different background to myself, much more well off and could afford to provide the best possible education. 

Although he was sent to a very good private boys school, Danny eventually got frustrated with living with his father and asked to come back and live with me, which he has been doing for the last eight months and has been attending the local school. 

Danny has a girlfriend called Lucy. She's from the same sort of background as Danny's dad. Parents very well off and also attends a prestigious girl's school. She has come and stayed with us a few times and is absolutely lovely. Very smart and pretty, and wants to be a lawyer when she's older. Her parents are in the same social circles as his father which is how they met. 

Danny and Lucy don't get to spend much time together since her family live miles away. The last time she was here, she told me that she wants to live here with Danny, move to the school he goes to etc, and was wondering if it were possible. Apparently her parents are extremely controlling and pressuring (much like Danny's dad), and are also cold because they wanted a boy so they could ''continue the family line'' and have always resented her for that. 

I was pretty floored and was sure that this was just teen hormones talking. I'd be happy to have her since she's lovely, but the problem is we're basing this off a teenage relationship. Don't get me wrong, I've seen them together and I know these two adore each other, but we all know teenage relationships don't always work out, which would make things awkward if she's living with us. 

More importantly there is all the legal stuff to it. I'm sure her parents would fight it if I tried to become her guardian. I'm not even sure what the process to becoming a guardian is in the UK, but I'm sure it will be a thousand times more difficult if her parents are fighting it (especially as I don't doubt they can afford much better lawyers than me). 

A more minor point: Lucy moving here would mean a big lifestyle change for her. I make a decent income and can afford to live comfortably, and could probably afford one more mouth to feed, but Lucy has lived in the lap of luxury since she was born. Danny, at least, spent his formative years here and so when he moved back here it was just returning to normal rather than a jarring change. Lucy is used to a very different lifestyle to me. I've been out shopping with her, and while she's never been snobby or rude, she was genuinely surprised that I buy clothes from the supermarket. She and her parents have only ever gone to high end stores, and the kind of clothes she wears every day just aren't what I can afford on a regular basis. She gets driven practically everywhere which I certainly can't do with my work commitments. She's also always been to schools with people from her sort of background. We live in a fairly open minded community, but I'm worried that Lucy won't make many friends here because there won't be many people she has a lot in common with. I'm just concerned that Lucy might have a miserable time here and grow to resent me and Danny for it.  

Danny himself is all for it, but then what 15 year old boy doesn't want his girlfriend living with him. I'm not against it but would need some more info first.

What age is/was the hardest for you and your child?,"I have an almost 2yo and I’m having a difficult time with this age. I knew I would tho. Even with other kids, I’ve always had a harder time playing with toddlers. I usually do better with babies and pre-teens. 

My husband thinks that the toddler years will be the easiest and it’ll just get harder; especially teen years. 
I think the toddler years will be the most difficult for me, but think it will get hard again as she gets closer to a teen. I just kinda think there’s always going to be wonderful and difficult things in every stage. Lol.

AUTISM PARENTING IS HARD. IT’S OK TO SAY IT.,"Regardless of special needs or not, haven’t all parents said this at some point? Mine sure did! This isn’t some new revelation focusing solely on autism itself, but with the increasing number of children being diagnosed, it’s a reality for millions of parents. Parents who are reaching out for help and just trying their best to educate themselves.

Unless someone has walked a day in your shoes, he/ she has no right to tell you how to feel. Just like with any struggle you’re having, reaching out for help and admitting it is the first step to finding peace.

As of late, I have been puzzled by the recent controversy I’ve been seeing on social media. More specifically,, within the social media online “support groups” geared towards parents of children and adults with autism. I scroll through reading comments of desperate parents reaching out for help or just wanting to vent about how hard some days can be only to be met with parent shaming and criticism.

While thankfully there are supportive comments, as well as very supportive groups, there are still groups that have comments calling out these parents for admitting that it’s tough. The comments can be shocking and downright horrible, calling out parents and scolding them for sharing their feelings and going as far as to screenshot their posts and re-sharing them to other communities just to shame them. I’ve personally been through this, and lucky for me, I’m almost 19 years in and have grown a thick skin. I can ignore it. However, there are many new parents who are emotionally fragile, isolated, and depressed. They already feel as though they are failing as parents, and these comments are only making them feel worse. Many people retreat, already questioning their parenting, and become even more depressed and too vulnerable to reach out.

It’s funny; parents of newborns will be the first to tell you that the sleep deprivation from waking at all hours of the night is tough. They have to deal with colic, reflux, formula, the diapers, the bottles, pack- ing diaper bags, strollers, pediatricians, the lack of sleep, and don’t forget the LAUNDRY!

As a parent of two young men on the spectrum (both born in the same year), I remember those days vividly, and while yes, it was a lot of work, I expected it, I knew what was coming. I listened to those stories and took notes, “nap when the baby sleeps,” etc. Those stories helped me out! Taking care of two babies was exhausting, but I savored those days knowing they would be short-lived (or so I thought). With all the advice I had been given and continued to receive after their arrival, I felt prepared knowing that I could handle it and that this was the norm, and that eventually, life would become much easier.

By the age of two and three, both of my boys had been diagnosed with autism. I was on my own. My husband (at the time) was deployed to Iraq for over a year and would then be deployed for the next few years to Afghanistan and Korea. Given that I had only been in the US for a few years (I had moved to the US from Canada), I had made a few friends at work, but my social circle and support system was nonexistent.

Those years were the toughest years of my life. My boys didn’t sleep for the first eight years. Both were non-verbal, both had extreme sensory issues, and both eloped. My younger son was in diapers until the age of four and drank from a bottle until seven. The tantrums were daily and all through the night. My days had no beginning and no end. Going out was hard; restaurants were impossible unless we could drive through them. My eldest was progressing so fast it was as if his au- tism traits were disappearing. He began to realize his brothers’ special needs and kept asking when his brother would talk or even play with him. He took on the role of protector, causing him to grow up much too fast. We were all overwhelmed.

Finally, I decided to stop worrying and just embrace it. You choose your mood, and we needed to be happy. 

Rather than being depressed about not going to restaurants, I looked on the bright side and got excited about getting takeout and enjoying it on the couch with a movie.

We stopped feeling sad just because my son doesn’t come out when we have people over or may not want to be a part of the party. He’s very happy in his room knowing that everyone is here and will come out and ask them to stay when they leave. It’s just the way he enjoys it. The repetitive behaviors and loud vocal tics are hard and take a toll, but similar to him having to adapt to the sound of the bathwater running, we have adapt- ed to this. I often tell myself that if it bothers me, imagine how he feels?







Going out is hard and requires a great deal of plan- ning, but I refuse to just stay home. How will he learn? What kind of life would that be? 

I want him to be used to this so he’s prepared as an adult. I have found that traveling brings out the best in him and it’s usually when I see the most progress. 

People asked me why I put myself through all this stress, but for me, it wasn’t an option. I have two kids. I never wanted autism to dictate our life and have his brother miss out on things and end up resentful. This life is exhausting and stressful, but it’s amazing the strength and patience you can have when having strength and patience is your only option. Over time I’ve learned to follow his lead. A behavior that seems odd to me doesn’t always need correct- ing. It’s amazing when you open your mind and go with the flow; there is often a “method to the mad- ness” and a perfectly reasonable explanation for that supposedly odd behavior...we just may not see it right away.",parenting

My 3.5 yr old doesn't give a hoot...,"My oldest child 3.5 does not listen. Not to me, not to my spouce, not to her grandparents and not to her teachers.

Ex. We get home from school. ""Please take off your boots and wash hands""... Walks straight into the house and starts touching and handling toys...
Time for bath ""please take of your clothes and go to the bathroom to start bathtime."" Completely ignores me and continues what she is doing... 
She is running around the house like a terror, and I say ""please stop running, you are scaring the dog... Let's play a game on the carpet."" Runs faster, screams louder and does it near the dog... 

Her teacher at school (montesori daycare) has told me she doesn't listen and we need to work on it... With focused play at home... Meaning timing her doing activities... ""Let's colour for 5 minutes"" and have her do the task for that long... We are doing this... Doesn't help.

We had her hearing checked, she's fine.  Dr reccomend ""1,2,3 magic"" we do it... It doesn't help...

I'm at the end of my rope...  literally I have tried everything... Calmly talking, explaining why I'm asking for things, 1,2,3 magic, time outs, spankings, taking away toys, taking away the limited tv time she gets, reward charts... This kid does not care. She does what she wants and nothing else...

It's gotten so bad that I think I need anger management... the only time she listens is when I scream... and I just feel so much rage when I ask and ask and ask, and when she just totally disregards me and any consequences.  *I feel the brunt of it because I do most of our child focused tasks...

I don’t agree with how they spend their time together. My ex is really into concerts and stuff and always takes him. I don’t like him being in that type of environment because he could get hurt. I know she doesn’t drink when she has him, and she does have him wear hearing protection. However I’m uncomfortable when people they meet at these shows stop us around town to talk to him. I’ll get pictures from people I know of him out at late hours.

Last month we were supposed to get family pictures done with my entire family. When she dropped him off he had a bright green mohawk. So I had to be the bad guy and cut it off and he’s still mad at me over it. 

She keeps him out late and usually by the time I get him he’s exhausted. So most of the time while he’s here he’s napping.

I don’t think she’s terrible. She does make him do chores and work on school stuff, but I’m worried she’s harming him. How do bring it up and make her stop?

EDIT: I cut the mohawk because it was our whole family and down the road I didn’t want to see everyone else looking presentable and my kid has the huge green hawk. It would have reflected poorly on my authority over my own child.",parenting
How to get 5/6 year olds to stay in bed and actually sleep?,"Hello,

Anyone have any advice on how to get kids to actually stay in bed and go to sleep.

We put this one in bed at around 7/8pm and she will make 1000 excuses as to why she had to get out (had to pee, forgot to put something in my backpack, random pains, hunger, etc.) and/or will stay awake in her room and not sleep until 10 or later. If we get fed up and let her go to our bed, she is out like a light though.

As you can imagine this makes the mornings pretty unbearbale as she is always cranky. She's so tired that we end up having to brush her teeth and wash her up and dress her. She's 6, she should be doing this all herself.

Any tips are greatly appreciated. Also, anyone have any ideas as to the underlying psychological causes of this? Anything to pay attention to or be concerned about?

How to make everyone feel special in the family,"Hey folks this is my first reddit post. I just wanted to share something that might help out folks finding balance between becoming being a spouse and a parent. I have to admit what might work for my family may not work for your.
My wife and I have one daughter (16f) and one son (14m). 

Our family takes always three trips a year of 4-5 days. However the twist we don't go  as a family. First trip wifey and I take our kids on separate vacations with one parent and one kid starting around the same time. Next trip we switch kids. The third and final trip is a couples only trip usually for our anniversary. Yes we do family vacations but once every two years.

We've doing this ever since they were five years old and it was worth it. Around the time we realized we as parents we do alot of things with our kids but we don't ""actually spend time with him"". Doing homework with them or taking them to soccer practice isn't spending time with him as going through our daily routines. I connect much more when we are playing SMASH BROS and talking about life than doing anyone of those things previously mentioned. I also connect with my daughter when I taking her out for lunch. My wife has got their own thing going with them. By finding common ground with our kids we found being parent was less of a burden and more of a relationship. We also do little to make them feel inclusive like if they like our clothes what music are the listening to.

We have also seen so many positives outcomes of this. Both kids are straight A students because they feel more comfortable asking us for help when it comes to tutoring or further practice. They also put more work in their academics because of they have faith in us in not punishing them frequently but pushing them foward. They are well mannered and very compassionate. They both respect we aren't just parent but many other  thing. They respect when we make time for ourselves or with someone because we value time with them. They are less argumentative and are willing to discuss thing if we have opposing points. They help out in the house.

The point I'm making is that don't make parenting be all about the daily chores that comes with being a parent. Find a connection with each child so that when they hear how you unconditionally love them. They not only know it but feel it.",parenting

Advice needed - which school district is best?,"I live in a moderately affluent suburb of a large US midwestern city. My city does not have its own school district - it actually feeds into four different school districts, depending on where you live. We purposely chose to buy in an area of the city that feeds into a school district that is less-desirable. Our school district also draws from more working-class suburbs and is much more racially and socio-economically diverse than the other three in our city (one of which is widely recognized as the best district in the state). Our son’s elementary school is the highest performing in the district and has a higher concentration of affluent families than the other elementary schools in the district due to its location in the “affluent” city. While the district’s academic record is less-stellar than others, we figured that we could always supplement his academics, but it would be more difficult to provide him with the kind of racial and socio-economic diversity that his school/district offers. He’s gone to this school since kindergarten and is now in 4th grade. We have a great community of families at this school and we’re also deeply involved with our local little league. We really have a great community here. 

My wife and I both went to the same large public high school in another state in a district that was very affluent. There were definite pros and cons, but overall, we both felt like little fish in a huge sea and since you had to be the best of the best for almost any activity or academic area, we both felt mediocre, despite being bright, talented people. This sense of self has been pervasive into our adult lives and we didn’t want our son to have that same experience. 

The high school our son will attend in our district is good enough, but it’s not outstanding. There’s a real opportunity to stand out, even if you’re not The Most Amazing Ever. Our son is a bright kid - he catches on to concepts really quickly and can move through curriculum at a rate that’s faster than most of his peers. He’s also a pretty talented athlete who LOVES baseball and it’s looking like baseball will always play a big role in his life. He’s in his school’s gifted and talented program and while I think he’s bright and motivated, I don’t think he’s exceptional. Still, in order to be actually challenged academically in elementary school, he relies on the one hour a week of gifted and talented programming he gets. The rest of the time I feel like he’s just treading water. I believe he should be receiving the same level of challenge most of the time in his regular classroom. I’ve joined my district’s gifted and talented advisory committee and the district is planning changes that I see as positive, but it’s slow-moving and I’m not convinced that their efforts won’t ultimately fall short of what I know my son needs. 

So here’s my conundrum. The next town over has a school district that has a really stellar baseball program and is much more academically rigorous than our current district. Their gifted and talented program is incredibly well thought out and meets the needs of a diverse range of learners. I know we’d be able to find the appropriate academic challenge for him in that district. And since their baseball program is so strong, I know he’d be well-positioned to really grow in that area too (I should note that we have him in a private baseball development academy which he’d attend no matter where we live). As for the community, it’s VERY affluent - more than where we are now. We can afford to live there, but I understand that there’s a pretty clear divide between the “Haves” and the “Have-nots.” We’d for sure be in the “Have-nots” camp. Plus they have one high school and it gives me flashbacks to my own experience. 

I don’t know what to do. Do we stay where we are, embedded with our community and all his friends, continue to be involved to make things better for my son and for all the students in the district, or do we leave and go where our son can be appropriately challenged in both academics and athletics, but will likely struggle more to stand out and risk him developing a feeling of never being enough? What harm is there in not providing him with the challenge he needs? Is it better to be a big fish in a little pond? Or a medium fish in a huge ocean? Might he have more opportunities if he can really stand out as an athlete? Or will he become a better player if he’s playing in a well-funded program with a team of talented players?

5 Year Old Telling Elaborate Lie at Kindergarten,"My 5 year old just started kindergarten and has been happy with no issues for the past month. But her teacher just told me she's been telling everyone this elaborate story about her mom having a baby and having lots of doctor's appointments and going to the hospital and how the baby sleeps with me and really fanciful stuff (no babies here). She tells little fibs around the house about brushing teeth and we always tell her not to lie about things, that honesty is best and we never punish her for it. But this is really sort of out of character for her. My husband and I are going to talk to her about it but I'm not sure how to best approach it in a way that is sympathetic and also ends the lie. 

She is an only child and will stay that way but has shown no interest in siblings. We are going through a rough time right now because my mother is battling the end stages of breast cancer and I've been going through some grieving, but we've been very open with her about it in a child appropriate way and her routine hasn't changed at all other than starting K. And she was in full time private preK and preschool so school isn't a new thing. Her imagination is pretty vivid as she spends a lot of time building LEGO sets and creating worlds for the characters in them. I want her to be imaginative but...not like this, obviously.

"First time mom due March 2020, having weird fears and anxiety about having a daughter. Mostly about not liking her, family toxicity and her being ugly and bullied.","Hi! I’m going to be a mom! Yay! But my family has been plagued with toxic people. Boo! I am pretty fortunate not to be a toxic, manipulative, spiteful, blame everyone else - kind of person. I married a nice, supportive man, we live very normal lives, and I don’t consider ourselves to be douche bags at all.  Because of my family, I’m hyper- self aware of all my actions, and I always hold myself accountable for my own mistakes and shitty behavior.  Because my family never did. They were fucking awful.

However, I have been worrying about my future daughter. 

1. What if I don’t like her as a person? Because while I love my toxic family, if they weren’t my family I would not EVER associate with them because I don’t like them as people. What if she is like my mom, dad or brother? What if I don’t like my own daughter? OMG I wake up in the middle of the night terrified I’ll be toxic towards her or she will be toxic. And then she’ll do drugs and run away and marry some bum and never talk to me again!!! My mind is ruminating, as you can see.

2. I was an ugly duckling. I turned out pretty nice looking, but boy was I ugly when I was a pre-teen. Even before pre-teen. And I wasn’t athletic. I was just so awkward, and I was severely bullied. What if she looks like me and is bullied?  I wouldn’t wish my life on anyone, and the thought of her looking like me terrifies me. 

Any advice or personal stories?

Thanks!

Bus stop advice,"I have a son who started kindergarten at the end of July. He’s doing really well in school, no behavior issues, and lots of friends. I started off the school year driving him every morning and picking him up in the afternoons, I’m a stay at home mom so I have no issue doing this. A couple of weeks into the school year, he decided he wanted to start riding the bus because two of the kids at the bus stop at the next apartment building are in his class. Everything has been fine for the most part up until this point. 
There’s two woman at the bus stop, I’ll call them A and D, who lived together. The apartment is in D’s name, A was just supposed to be staying there temporarily because she got in a fight with her last roommate and got domestic battery charges. Every morning they’re bickering and fighting at the bus stop, so D typically doesn’t come out, just A with both of their kids. A and the third mom there, J, always talk crap and gossip about D. J has told both D and I, that she’s only friends with A because she’s scared of getting beat up. 
Anyway...
Tuesday morning D and A we’re fighting and yelling at each other at the bus stop as usual. A was complaining about living with D.  I told them to stop fighting in front of the children, and that if the living conditions are so bad that they need to fight daily, A needs to move as it’s not her apartment anyway. Things escalated, cops got called, and there was a physical altercation. A now lives across the hall with J. 
The last two mornings and afternoons, A and J have been trying to pick fights with me in front of all the children and I’m not sure what to do at this point. I don’t want to continue to subject all the children to the fighting, but my son loves riding the bus. Would it be selfish of me to start driving him again over this petty drama? I’m just at a loss.",parenting
Update: do I give up our house for a flat to better our living standards.,"So a month ago I took the plunge and moved us from our 2 bed house to a 2 bed maisonette (own front door and entry way) and honestly I'm so so so glad we did it. 

Everyone has commented that ""now I've seen it I would have done it also"". The flat is just so much bigger, the smallest room is bigger than the biggest room in the old place. Theres so much storage and a 40ft loft! 

My eldest loves the place but its very apparent he loves his new found mum, my energy, zest for life and overall outlook on things has just changed 180. 

We now have story time, bath time, he helps me cook, I want to do activities with him, I've noticed both boys aren't tipping all their toys out anymore as we're all more involved. 

IVE BEEN OUT ON MY OWN IN THE VILLAGE this is the first time since march last year I've left the house on my own. I took me and my eldest conker hunting, we collected some and climbed some trees. It was amazing! Then we came home and had hot chocolate. 

Honestly every day I am so blessed to be here, considering April last year I was under the crisis team for suicide watch and had a mental health nurse come see me daily for 3 weeks, you wouldn't even believe that person ever existed. 

Right now I'm sat on my sofa where I have a breath taking view of the sunset over the countryside, the boys have stripped of their school uniform and left their bags on the floor but to me it's just living, it doesn't stress me out anymore.

My eldest has also been accepted into the school here in the village which is a 5 minute walk and a church of England school, hes so excited to start on monday, which will lead to friendship groups here in the village. 

The community here is amazing, the market is such a social event every Thursday, and everyone pulls together for everything

I know I haven't made the best sense but I'll round it up with honestly I am so happy and we dont even notice not having a garden, we have a communal one we play in. I am so glad I done this. Life is pretty amazing. 

So thank you for your advice.",parenting

23 month old obsessed with his penis!,"So I am at a loss.... my son has been obsessed with his penis for about a year. I mean if we are at home this kid stays in footed pajamas! The main problem is that if he isn’t he is so busy trying to touch himself that he will hardly do anything else, if we are at the park, he will slide and play for a few minutes and then sit down and try to get his hands in there, at a restaurant his hands are in there (super gross), essentially anywhere we go my son just wants to play with himself. 

So I was originally thinking this is a phase and that he will grow out of it, but it’s been about a year and is showing no signs of stopping. When I tell him to get his hands out of there he just looks at me with the cutest little face and giggles and then the hands go right back. I have tried to be stern and raise my voice, same reaction, just giggling. I mean I understand basic anatomy and that he is probably doing this because it feels good, but how do I get him to stop. He is too young to understand that he should only do this in private and I don’t want to give him some kind of complex about his penis. 

The other problem is that when trying to get to it he frequently takes off his diaper, he pees in restaurants and other public places and all over the house (hence the new pajama policy).

What do I do? do I go ahead and try to potty train him so at least he isn’t peeing everywhere? What do I do about preschool next year? 

Also, is this a really bad sign about what is to come when he hits puberty?!? 🤦🏼‍♀️",parenting
6 year old son made a sarcastic comment in class yesterday,"My 6 year old son has high-functioning autism and some severe speech, communication, and social delays. He was nonverbal until he was 3 (although he could communicate using sign language before that). To this day, his communication skills are very delayed. He is unable to express his own original thoughts and cannot apply social skills to new and unfamiliar situations, and becomes disregulated when faced with this kind of situation. Because of this, he communicates entirely through scripts and is only able to say something if he hears someone say a similar comment immediately beforehand.

My son is in a classroom for delayed children (although most of the children have primarily academic delays, which he has no problem with). Yesterday, his teacher made a sarcastic comment to the classroom aide in a voice the children could hear. My son enjoyed the presentation of this comment, so, using scripts, he pasted together his own sarcastic comment about another student in the classroom. For the record, we have never used sarcasm at home in front of him, so this was entirely new for him. The teachers were so shocked by his mature use of sarcasm that they suspended him for two days. I think this suspension is very unjustified because, first, he has never had behavior problems like defiance and bullying. Second, he didn't know that sarcasm can be hurtful, since he has never seen sarcasm before and was only scripting. However, the school wouldn't have any of this and insisted that it was due to a behavior problem, which I (and my son's therapists) know it isn't. What should I do? Am I being one of those ""my little angel can do no wrong"" parents?",parenting

"""The Story of Life,"" by Catherine Barr and Steve Williams, is an excellent overview of evolution and Earth's history for young children.","I did a volunteer reading at my oldest son's Kindergarten this morning, and it went extremely well. Lots of great questions from his classmates, and his teacher seemed very pleased.

I was initially turned off by the illustrations, but these are a *feature* \- it seems like the hand-drawn aesthetic really helps little ones internalize the ideas that are being conveyed.

Evolution is a complex subject for little ones to wrap their head around, and the way this book summarizes everything in a 10-minute read is really remarkable.

Here's an [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Life-First-about-Evolution/dp/1847804853) link, but personally I just checked the book out from my local library:

4 y/o started hitting,"So a couple of months a go my son attended a birthday party with his grandma. After the party grandma told us he hit kids at the party and even made the birthday boy cry. We talked with our son that hitting is bad, if he gets angry about something he should immediately distract himself. 
On Monday his school called us for a meeting, they said he is hitting children if stuff doesn't doesn't go his way, like they won't play stuf he wants to play. We talked again and he promised never to hit again. 
Today it happened again. I'm trying to explain him that, I also get angry to bunch of stuff, waiting in lines or times he doesn't dress up but instead hides somewhere. He always says ""yes"" or ""right"" but I don't think we're getting anywhere. I'm afraid he will loose friends and no one will play with him which will make him more sad. He is grounded right now.

Trying to figure out how to deal with relationship with my Brother concerning my kids.,"I (35m) have two kids 3M and 6mo M. My older brother (39M) recently as in 2 weeks ago just had a child. My brother is a perennial fuckup. He's been a drug addict since he was probably 16 or 17. He's been in and out of jail all over the country for the last 15 years. He recently married a girl whom I knew growing up. She has 2 kids from 2 fathers and this baby is now the 3rd from a 3rd father. The first 2 kids are in the care of her parents. Currently they do live on their own, but I do know what the were fairly recently living with my parents.

Currently Im pretty much no contact with him as I do not agree with the way he mooches off my parents and I believe lies to them about the state of his sobriety. I don't have any proof he still uses but he's lost the benefit of the doubt with me.

My sons have never met their uncle and I intend to keep it that way until I know he's cleaned up and is living a semi-normal life. But now they have a cousin, who's done nothing wrong and has been born into, what I believe to be a pretty bad situation. My oldest loves his only other cousin, from my wife's side,  whom he gets to see about 5-6 times a year and he talks about her constantly. I don't want to deprive him and my youngest of having a relationship with another cousin, but I don't want them exposed to my brother. And honestly I don't want to deprive myself of a relationship with my new niece.

Another wrinkle in this whole deal is that I have sinking feeling this child is either going to end with her parents, or my parents. Her parents are ok but also not the kind of people I would want raising kids. My parents are great, successful people who have tried their entire lives and spent probably 10s of thousands of dollars over the years to help my brother. But they are almost 70 and I don't think they have the kind of energy to raise a child.

Having a tough time with the baby,"Stay-at-home dad of two girls, 2.5 and 6mo.

Our oldest had a feeding aversion that got bad enough she had to get a feeding tube. She eats good now, but her doctors still make us use the tube to build up her weight. We might have it out by the time she is 3 though.

Youngest is a much better eater, but still nothing near what other parents talk about. She is like 30th percentile, which is fine, but we'd love her to be higher.

Both kids were fed expressed breast milk in Dr. Brown bottles, as per the recommendation of every doctor we've ever seen. In addition to working an insanely demanding job, my wife sacrifices much of her sleep and time with the kids pumping.

When I'm out in public, and I see someone with a baby, and then they whip out a bottle and just hold it in the general direction of the baby's face, and the baby just guzzles the whole thing down in a minute or two....I want to strangle someone. I get so irrationally angry.

Neither of our kids would touch a bottle in public. If they weren't swaddled, in their room, in the dark, rocking, being held a very specific way, with the bottle pointed at just the perfect angle, they wouldn't eat. And our oldest still wouldn't eat enough even then. Both of them would thrash their heads side to side, trying to get away from the bottle.

What makes me even angrier is when I see other parents making posts like this one, worrying that their kid isn't eating enough. Because it's almost always like "" I'm so worried! Our baby only ate 48 oz of milk today, instead of her normal 64! What am I going to do!!!!"" Or ""Our toddler hasn't been eating well. This morning she only hat two porterhouse steaks, a baked potato and a gallon of milk!"" Man, I had days where our oldest at 7 oz of milk the whole day. And even when she was getting some solids, 1 tsp of baby food per meal was a hard-fought victory. We'll see how our youngest does with solids. She's about ready.

Nothing is medically wrong with either of them. Keep your suggestions to yourself. We've tried everything. If I get another suggestion, I might explode.

Anyway, our oldest eats great now, like I said. She has healthier eating habits than any toddler I know. She loves olives, cottage cheese, pecans, pasta, taco meat, so many other things. She eats some things even adults are picky about. If it were up to me, we'd quit using the tube immediately, because that Boost formula suppresses hunger. It's not supposed to, but it does. She eats better without it. But the doctors won't let us. So we're just staying the course a little while longer.

Our youngest is better than her older sister. By a mile. And I count my blessings every day for that. Most days she's cooperative. Some days, she's just impossible. Some days she will eat in her rocker, which I wouldn't do, but she HATES to be held, unless she's in the swaddle, in her room, in the dark, etc. I can't just feed her anywhere in the house, like a normal parent. And I always have to make sure to time our outings around her feedings, because she will not eat in public, and if she misses a whole feeding, there goes the whole day.

This is just a vent. I don't need anything. We'll keep pushing, and we'll get there. If we could survive our oldest, we'll survive this one.

But I don't know if I will ever get over the anger I have when I see another parent calmly and easily feeding their child. And even the thousands of parents and children who have it much, much worse than us, at least they have a diagnosis they understand! At least there's an explanation. Not so with us.

I know we're not literally the only people who have kids that refuse to eat for no good reason. But it definitely feels like a very small group of us. And there's really no help. Just keep the kid clinging to life by their fingernails, and one day they'll just grow out of it. The end.

What to do with a 1st grader who might have a special aptitude for something (math) but has no interest in pursuing it?,"Basically the jist of my problem is what do I do if I want to guide my child through her journey of self-discovery - help her know what she's good at and what she wants to do - but at the same time not wanting to thrust her into anything excessively that she may genuinely not want to do?


See my kid is a 1st grader and in her school, they are given aptitude tests for various subjects. It turns out that after taking those tests, the faculty has determined that she has a knack for doing math. So they want to include her in a special program for advanced math that would eventually be parlayed into math competitions where she is part of a team that represents the school.


The problem is that my kid has no interest. She doesn't *hate* math, but, I mean... she's in first grade. In her spare time, she wants to play and watch stuff, not study anything more than what she needs to.


How to go about this? Because forcing her any more than our current level of encouragement doesn't feel right. I'm thinking of trying to talk her into a deal where she focuses on the math stuff for this year - try as hard as she genuinely can and see what comes of it - then if she really doesn't like it, then we won't push her in that direction any more.

How do you sustain encouragement in this situation if she keeps saying that she doesn't want to join. She just wants to do normal math. She can't do the advanced math. She wants to do other things?",parenting

High pitched scream when tired - 4.5 month old,"My 4.5 month old recently started this high pitch, ear piercing, tenitius inducing screaming when he's tired. It's worse when anyone but me (mom) is holding him, when it happens. 

95% of the time, he's a very happy, smiley, alert, easy going baby. Even when he wakes up 9/10 times he's smiling and just hangs in his crib for like 10 minutes. Like, strangers come up to me and ask if he's always so happy...

And he is, until he gets tired lately. I made the mistake of googling high pitched screaming in babies and am now actually worried. I thought he just found a more effective noise and was practicing it, or he was just having trouble putting himself to sleep/back to sleep more often, but now I'm wondering, is this normal?",parenting
11 Month Old Wakes Up Constantly,"I write this with dark circles under my eyes and not enough coffee to make me even feel somewhat awake. 

My 11 month old has been an awful nighttime sleeper for the past month. He wakes up constantly, at least 4 times through out the night. He’s hard to get back to sleep. When he wakes up around 2 AM, he acts as if he’s ready to get up and go. His lack of sleep is driving me crazy.

How to tell daughter about a murder-suicide,"I don't really know what to do. My daughter is twelve and one of her friends recently died, as well as the friend's parents and two siblings. The father shot and killed them all and then killed himself. She wasn't super close with the girl, but they were pals who saw each other now and then and sent each other memes and stuff. They didn't go to the same school (we live about 40 min apart) and she doesn't seem to have heard anything, but I kind of have to tell her, don't I?

What on earth should I say? Once I tell her, she'll have questions. What do I say? I know about resources for grief in general - she's already lost her grandma and some pets - but what do you say about something as awful as this? It's not like ""normal"" death. I know she'll ask about a funeral and maybe even google her friend, and so I have to explain.

Cold season is upon us and apparently we’re fucked and that’s just that.,"I found [this](https://healthcare.utah.edu/the-scope/shows.php?shows=0_5nzgsffm) strangely relieving and hilarious.

When did you mentally adjust to parenthood with first baby?,"Hi there. Throw away account. 

I am 26, FTM to a 4 month old. He’s a sweet, easy baby, so I feel I have no room to complain. I am working full time 36 hours a week, late hours, and I am EXHAUSTED pretty much every day.

I have been diagnosed with severe PPD and am trying and taking all kinds of psych meds and am in therapy. I am working very very hard to try and overcome my PPD.

I am still mourning my old life and find myself spending an unhealthy amount of time wishing for my old life back. I wake up in the morning sometimes forgetting I have a baby to care for, and the sinking, drowning disappointment kills me when I remember I am.  I love my son but I honestly deeply regret him. And it kills me.

I know the sooner I find acceptance, the sooner I will feel happy again.

birthday theme stolen - rant,"We’ve been planning an astronaut space theme party for my daughters 3rd birthday, down to the astronaut costume and helmet, I have a whole Pinterest board going. I swear I’ve talked to all my family about it since we’re just that excited. My daughter before bed always tells me when she grows up she wants to be an astronaut and go to the moon in a rocket ship. It’s adorable. Anyway, I just received an invite to my nephews 3rd birthday party, which is the weekend before hers, and guess what theme it is? SPACE THEMED. I’m so disappointed. I know she will be too although we can convince her to have like a mermaid party or something. It just sucks cuz if we were to keep it, it would look like we ripped off their idea. Ugh. She was gonna be the cutest little astronaut 😭 I’m guessing the only thing to do is change my theme..... I’m lucky I haven’t invested in it yet, just time.

**edit** Boy, *few* of you sure can be hurtful with the name calling and such.. I realize that people on the internet can’t possibly understand my unique situation so I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. This family is very close to us, despite the drama we’ve had, and we see each other twice a week every week. My husband and I felt betrayed is all. We know if the situation was reversed we would get shit for it from them. However we’re over it today and who cares. 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Also, my child is 2 so her birthday vision constantly changes, obviously lol. First she wanted blippi, then space, but I don’t think she can truly comprehend what that means. I’m sure us parents enforce it more so. I’m sure this is something we were more excited about than her.  And my next paragraph will go into that more..... 

I think we just solved the dilemma 🤣 my daughter is so cute and I think all us parents throwing big themed parties should take a note from her book!  So when I asked her again what kind of birthday she wanted, space theme, mermaid theme, something else or no theme she said no theme! When asked what she wants for decorations, She replied she wants red balls on the walls, balloons everywhere, and she wants to dress up as a cake. 🤣👍🏻 I love it. You got it girlfriend.",parenting
Experience with encopresis/accidents,"Hi all, throwaway as really very lost about what to do with my daughter and her potty training.

I've been told what we have been experiencing is encopresis, but I've also read that only gets diagnosed after 4, she is 3.5, so wondering if this is true encopresis or can we just put it down to accidents during training?

Basically we struggled immensely at the start, pee no problem but small poo accidents several times daily. Withholding, associated constipation, potty refusal, the works. We dropped it and eased off the pressure and suddenly she has turned into a star, will tell us when she needs to do a poo, and has had an amazing run of two weeks with only the occasional poo accident. This is after about 3 months of training.

The problem now seems to be that the accidents start up again when she misses a day, we are finding if she does one big poo a day then she is fine. Which makes me inclined to think it is encopresis, and not just an accident.

I suppose I wanted to know if anyone has gone through a similar experience and how did you handle it? Did they eventually just come good and no more accidents? I know people promote medical interventions for encopresis but she seems to be doing so well that I don't think she needs any help. As long as she goes daily then no problem.",parenting

Only child dealing with sharing attention.,"Hey guys. So my daughter is 5 and has a terrible time sharing my attention with anyone else (just mine and not my husband's/her father). I assume this is because I'm with her almost everyday, all day. I'm a stay at home mom and will be until she starts kindergarten next year. Today I watched one of my nieces and my daughter just couldn't stand that I was paying attention to anyone but her. They did great until about 2 hours in and we were at a trampoline park to burn off some energy. After that it was a fight for attention (I should say my niece, she's 2, has a brother my daughter's age, when I've watched my nephew this wasn't a problem). I'm just unsure how to handle this since I only have 1 kid to contend with most days and honestly I'm mostly worried about how this will play out once she goes to school. She will most definitely not be the center of attention (which I've explained to her) because the teacher and or/ the aid will have about 20 other students or so to contend with. She interacts with plenty of kids in our neighborhood and also sports activities, and having them over tonplay with, this is not a problem for her, other than being bossy because she's stubborn and wants things her way (she has gotten much better about this and letting this roll off her shoulders), she does great. The problem seems to be she's not the center of my attention, mostly with family, even though I've explained to her that her aunt put her child in my care and I'm responsible for her safety. What would you say is the best way to handle this? I'll admit for the first couple of years I was a helicopter mom, not knowing really how to deal with a kid. I've backed off, let her fall down and hurt herself after I told her something was dangerous. First hand experience is a good thing for kids to live through. I guess after this I'm questioning how to deal with the jealousy of me watching her cousins and if this behavior will bleed into her going to school for the first time.",parenting
My 3.75 yr old creeps out other kids and their parents at the playground with his intimidating behaviour.,"
My 3yr old boy seems to be a normal young lad. He’s been going to daycare twice weekly since he was 18 months old however he’s been described to me as a bit of a loner and doesn’t do well in group settings.

He’s been doing what I found to be strange since he was 2 and I thought he would just grow out of it. When we meet a child at a park he’ll approach them and stand in front of them until they meet his eyes and stare a them wordlessly. This is usually followed by both sets of parents asking their respective toddler to say “Hi” or ask each other their names. No matter what happened with the other party ours won’t say anything. He’ll get in between children and their
Mothers and stand over the child like a silent character from and 80’s slasher movie. He squares up to kids like people do in prison before they are about to start pushing one another. Sometimes nearly nose to nose. 

I’ve tried to let it play out. If the child tries to get out of the way he’ll move into their path. If they break the tension in some way, like run off and play he’ll snap out of it and play along. If not then he’ll stare them down until either sides parents grow uncomfortable and remove the child. I’ve gotten countless dirty looks at parks from mother’s or fathers. I’ve tried to intervene and he just wants to get away from me and back to what he was doing. This ends up scaring either the other kid or the parent and they tend to bugger off shortly after. 

He also does this when we are out and will intentionally run up to an adult and stand at their feet and stare up at them. He will not respond to anything they saying just stand in their way.

Is this normal behaviour for 3yr olds? He’s my first. I just thought it was a shyness thing at first but now I don’t know. I want to help him. Any advice on how I might be able to approach this?",parenting
NICU aftermath,"I’m starting to slowly realize that I’m not doing so well.
My 2nd son was born August 27th. He was a scheduled c section at 38 weeks due to my pregnancy induced hypertension (blood pressure was 160/110 so drs didn’t want to wait.) 
We had no indication that he wouldn’t be fine, but he wasn’t fine. He was grunting after being born, so they took him to the NICU thinking that he’d be there on oxygen for a night then back down with us.
His condition deteriorated quickly. 
Long story short, he had severe respiratory distress and a surfactant deficiency. He ended up with a large pneumothorax (hole in his lung and escaped air) which was causing his heart to stop beating. He had 2 needle excisions of air and ended up having a chest tube placed to pull the air out. He was on a ventilator for about a week. He had an umbilical line into his heart to monitor blood gas. He was tpn fed and sedated on fentanyl. He went through withdrawal at about a week old. Once he was extubated he was on oxygen for a while. He was remarkably only in the NICU for 12 days. 
Now he’s healthy and doctors say that his sickness at birth is over. It won’t affect him. He’s as healthy as any baby and we’ll never know that he had such a rough start.
Problem is, logically I know this, but I’m terrified. I’m terrified that he’s not ok. I keep having flashbacks to him almost dying. To watching him on life support. To all the alarms. I don’t know who to talk to. I’m sad and I’m scared. I’m having panic attacks. 
My husband thinks that because he’s fine now, I can just forget what happened. I can’t. 
My friends don’t understand. It was only 12 days, he’s fine now. 
But I’m just not grasping this, that he’s fine. 
I have watched both of my kids almost die.
My first son was born via emergency c section due to his heart rate dropping down to 30. He wasn’t breathing when he was born and had to be resuscitated. 
I’m just not ok and I don’t know what to do. I’m breastfeeding so I can’t take my medication. 
I sometimes panic so much that I drink and feed my son a bottle, but many times this ends up with me worse than I was.
My 3 year old is seeing this and doesn’t understand.
I need to get it together but can’t.
I know that I probably sound whiny and weak. I’m thankful that I have 2 healthy children, but I’m constantly afraid for their health.
I’m sorry to ramble, I just don’t know where to turn with this. I know I need therapy but I can’t motivate myself to reach out to either of my therapists.

Tidying up and the division of labor...how do you handle it?,"My wife and I have a nearly 2-year old son, and though we both work full time (her 36 hours a week, me 45-50) she works 12 hour days so only works 3 days a week.  I work M-F, 7ish to 5ish, she works a variable 7a-7p with some weekends.  It's a great schedule for us, as we only have to worry about child-care for those weekdays when she's working, and my MIL watches him on those days.

The problem lately though is the housework.  See, on the weekend days she's working, I am constantly picking up behind the kid to keep the house somewhat straight...of course there are messes, but I never let them get out of control.  When she's home with the kid, though, she just lets him run amok and trash the place to the point where, I roll up to the house at 5:30 and it's like a bomb went off inside, not just in the living room and the other play areas, but the kitchen has the remnants of the entire day's worth of meals all over the counters, dirty dishes stacked to the ceiling.  Like every toy the kid owns (and he's got **a lot**) dumped into a pile in the living room, legos and and markers and shit everywhere, strewn about the whole house.  We eat dinner about when I get home, give the kid a bath, read him a story and lay him down...then both end up having to spend two hours every night just getting everything picked up, vacuuming cookies off the rugs, sweeping and mopping the whole house, etc.  It takes the two of us until after 8pm to get everything put back the way it should be and cleaned up, and then it's pretty much bedtime for us...rinse/repeat.  I've mentioned to her that it would be nice to come home from work once in a while and *not* have the house look like the morning after a frat party, but her argument is that ""he's only going to be small for so long, and I don't want to waste time cleaning when we can be playing together, we can just do it when he goes to bed.""

Here and there is one thing, but this is almost *every single night*.  It's seriously starting to get to me as I feel like I'm literally working all day, every day.  She's watching the kid all day and I know how exhausting it can be, but I'm working all day too.  I'm not going to sit there and let her clean the whole house by herself because I'm not an asshole, but just once I want us both to be able to sit on the couch together after we put the kid to bed and enjoy a TV show or something...we never can.  Leaving it is *not* an option, either...my wife won't rest until the house is cleaned up.  I don't give a crap if his toys stay in a big pile for days, especially since he's most likely going to dump them all out again the next day anyway.  But she just won't let it, so instead we both spend most of the night cleaning, her reorganizing all his toys, picking out the grapes and raisins and crap from the pile, wiping everything down, me in the kitchen filling the dishwasher and then still having tons of shit to wash by hand, sweeping the whole house, mopping the whole house.  Every single night is like this.

I guess I'm just curious how most households handle this kind of shit, because I feel like the way we're going is not sustainable, and it's stressing me out.  Am I just being unreasonable here or what?  Is it normal for people to just let it build up all day like this and not address it until bedtime?",parenting

2 year says baby sitter hit him,"Good evening,

My two year old(27 months) son is picking up more and more language every day. He’s started talking in three word sentences Or putting together multiple small phrases to tell a story in the last few weeks. So far he’s only told stories that he was involved in or stories from a show that he’s watched. He goes to an in-home daycare run by an older woman. I’m changing names for anonymity but Today he came home and pretty clearly said “Susan hit john” where Susan is his baby sitter and John is his name. And he hit himself on his chest while doing this. This was concerning so my wife has been trying to get more out of him. Seems like it was related to nap time or possibly the younger baby she is also watching. 

I guess we’re just looking for advice on the best way to handle this situation. The plan is to ask her if she knows why he would be saying that. If she admits to full on hitting him then that’s obviously a deal breaker and we’ll be seeking new daycare. What if she denies it or has a good explanation? We’re inclined to trust her but we don’t want to discount our son either and leave him in a bad situation. Anyone else had a similar experience?",parenting
How much time will a newborn sleep in their crib each day?,"First time parent to a 7-day-old infant girl.  Our infant will cry almost the moment we set her in her crib.  My wife will pick her up and start breastfeeding her, but the baby will just drink a little and then fall asleep in my wife's arms after having just begun breastfeeding.  She'll sleep while my wife is holding her, but then cry the moment we set her down.  This goes on for maybe 17-18 hours of the day, and the baby will probably sleep in her crib for maybe 6 hours per day.  My wife is feeling very overwhelmed not being able to set our baby down or give her to me for very long.  This is our first child, so I was just wondering if this is normal, and if there's anything we could do better.

Introverted kids and socializing,"My kids are 7 and 10 and are both pretty introverted in general. They enjoy playdates but they also like to play alone or just with each other. This is 100% fine, but we live in a neighborhood with a ton of kids and the standard procedure is that whenever someone is bored they go and knock on a neighbor’s door to see if they can play. This is GREAT for most kids but my kids have a hard time with it. In the 5 years we have lived here I can count on two hands the number of times my kids have gone to knock on someone else’s door, but neighbors knock on our door all the time. I used to encourage my kids to play with whomever was at the door bc I didn’t want to be rude, but as they’re getting older I feel like I can’t force them to do it anymore. It’s gotten to the point that when certain kids come over my 10 year old will act weird and annoying on purpose in an effort to get them to leave.

Hello everyone.. I just found out that my 16 has barely been sleeping these past two years and it's worrying me.,"She goes to a prestigious high school and runs varsity cross country. She's a very hard working girl and she's very talented in running. I'm just so worried about her health. During the summer she was going to 9th grade, she told me she probably only slept 1 - 3 hours on average... and she never took naps. She had to wake up at 5:45 AM for morning practice and then she'd have to go to SAT prep from 12 PM - 6 PM. When she comes home she wants time to herself to relax, so she said she didn't start on her SAT homework until 3 AM, so usually she'd sleep around 3- 4 AM then wake up an hour &amp; 30 mins later for practice. This all happened when she just turned 14 years old. I don't know how she was even able to run so well like this. They have races in the summer and she's running 2 miles in 13 minutes and is already one of the fastest girls in the team. I'm just scared that her horrible sleep schedule has stunted her growth. Her sleeping schedule hasn't gotten any better at all. Sometimes I wish I can pull her out of high school but her dream school for college is very hard to get into and she told me she has to sacrifice sleep just to get into it. But lately, she has been complaining about how she thinks she stunted her growth and I would tell her that she didn't stunt it (but I don't know the real answer to this)

I know I shouldn't be worried about her growth, but it is worrying me. I don't want her to regret this later and feel bad about herself later. She is already regretting it. If it matters, she got her growth spurt from age 11 - 12 where she grew 4 inches. She got her period 3 months after turning 12. From age 12 - 13 she grew 2.5 inches. From age 13 - 14 it seems like she didn't grow at all, half an inch at the most, but she had a normal sleeping schedule at this time.  From age 14 - 15 when her sleeping schedule was absolutely messed up, she didn't grow at all.

My son(7) has been expressing a lot of anger towards his dads live in gf and son. How do I address this with their father?,"My two older sons, 7 and 9, have expressed in the past about how their dads gf can be mean. They say she has them doing military punishments (push ups and wall sits) if they are bad. She was in the military. It wasn’t hitting or yelling and I felt that it wasnt too bad. It’s exercise after all so I let it be but it was a bit off because never have I personally had punishment this way. 

They have mentioned many times how they don’t like her 4 year old son. I’ve met him a few times and this kid is a lot of work. My ex can’t have a handle on him. He says he thinks the kid has ADD. The issue with this little boy is not the kid himself but from what my son complains about is how he is always blamed for what the boy does. He’s visibly upset. He has mentioned how he doesn’t like the little boy and has told me how his dads gf never believes him and always blames him and his brother for the boys messes and misbehaviors. 

So the last time I mentioned to my ex that our boys were having issues with the little boys behavior their dad told me that it’s actually back and forth. That my kids sometimes start it and then the other kid can do things. He brushed it off. 

But now my son is non stop talking about how angry he feels about it. 

The incident that made my radar go up more is when my son was asking for extra money for his field trip. I told him to ask his dad for some on the weekend and he started crying and said, “ No he won’t do it _____(Dad’s gf) controls him”. Ok this isn’t normal. 

I want to vouch for my kid. I want to help him when now he’s obviously upset. But I don’t know how to get their dad to listen to his son.

College freshman hates college and I don't know how to help him.,"I have 2 kids in college and one still in high school. My oldest is a junior at a college a little over an hour away. My freshman is at an out of state school that is 12 hours away by car. 

My freshman is really struggling. The school is academically challenging but he is managing that part okay. He plays club soccer so he is meeting new people and putting himself out there but he's been struggling since he moved in (mid August). We just had family weekend and he begged to come back home with us when he left. He said he would only stay a week and would head back but we told him we couldn't do that and didn't want him missing a weeks worth of classes. 

He keeps having bad experience after bad experience. Rushing frats was awful for him and he says his roommate is a dick. My son goes to a different school than his girlfriend and no one from his high school goes there. My older son at least knew some kids that ended up at college with him. Last night he called us in tears and said he really misses home. 

I feel awful but I don't think we can do anything really. I told him to make sure he checks in with the councelors if it gets bad. He says he isn't depressed, just lonely.",parenting

I walked over and said to the other child ""I know we are playing and very excited but I can't let you hurt (my son's name)"" He still didn't let go so I removed his hands from son's arm. My son immediately calmed down and they went back to playing together. The other boys father finally came over and talked with their son.

Hes currently been banned from the switch for a week so far and he is an absolute nightmare.

Ive offered other activities for him to do and he either ruins them (eg i got us a mug decorating kit and he just scribbled all over his and then threw it because he said it was rubbish) or he spends the whole time sulking and moaning and saying he hates his life.

Im just at my wits end with how to keep him entertained but he isnt going back on the switch until he starts to realise theres more to life.

We have a dog that hes not interested in and he doesn't want any friends round either. And i try and play with him a fair bit like board games or hide and seek etc. 

Maybe this is just the modern world where kids dont play with toys anymore?! What am i doing wrong?",parenting
Parents who read to their children regularly - what benefits have you seen?,"My wife and I have an 18-month old son. We read to him almost every day - an assortment of short board books.

Snacks,"When I was a kid we ate 3 meals and maybe a piece of fruit somewhere in between.  What is the deal with kids and snacks?  Why do kids need to walk around with a backpack full of snacks.  I'm exaggerating, of course.  It's just something my daughter's mother and I disagree about.",parenting
How do you deal with different parenting approaches between you and your spouse?,"My husband and I have a four year old daughter, and while we agree on most basic stuff of parenting, there are certain things where we have very different approaches. When my husband is upset with our daughter, she comes crying to me, because I want to give her guidance through her emotions. I do tell her that I agree with her dad, but also I do comfort her, by providing physical contact. I also don't want to leave her alone when she's crying hysterically - husband says that might be necessary sometimes - and try to find compromises. Tonight I helped her a bit with tidying up her toys, although at first the deal was that she would start by herself - my husband thinks I'm helicoptering by shielding negative emotions from her. I will think about that and he might have a point there. But I'm also getting a sense, that there will be certain aspects of parenting where we might disagree. So, how can we deal with that? Let husband parent ""his way"" when he has an issue and likewise? Even if I think it might hurt our daughter emotionally or harm their relationship or bond?

"Today, I'm taking my daughter to the playground.","My time has been so crazy over the course of the last several months. For a list of reasons. Things are finally calming down.

I always have to say no. Whether it's 110 degrees outside or it's already late or we have to be somewhere, etc. She is always so disappointed.

"What a awesome morning, I'm my son's class room mom.","I'm the room mom to my son autism class. This class has kids from all over the spectrum in it. From high functioning ( like my son,  and a couple others) to middle and even some that do not talk at all. I love these kids, these kids are awesome. You want to meet some truly inspiring kids, come to this class. Plus the teacher and the aides rock as well.

Well back in September I started to plan out the Halloween class project. I done one on Halloween and one on Christmas. I found these light up wooden lanterns at Michael's. Awesome price, so I bought them and his them in my closet. Got glow in the dark paint, paint brushes, everything together. 

Today was the day I went in to do this. Here I am carrying this huge box down the hall to the class. Once I got their and in the class. And opened the box the kids got all excited. I called them up one by one to pick their lanterns, then to pick their paint colors.

The teacher hugged me and aides were surprised. I told them , I'm already planning the Christmas project. My son gave me the biggest hug. I got hugs from most of the kids and high fives. 

I love those kids...it's my son's last year in this school and in this class . I'm truly going to miss each and everyone of them. Today was a awesome day.",parenting
Getting discouraged potty training,"Currently on day two of potty training my 2.5yr old using the “Oh Crap” method and I’m really frustrated/discouraged.  She knows exactly what is going on and is holding all her pees but the second she finally bursts and lets it go, and I run her to the potty she stops immediately peeing and starts crying saying she doesn’t want to use the potty!

Anytime I suggest she try the potty or try to lead her to the potty when she obviously needs to go she just says no again and again that she WILL NOT use the potty!

I have trying to say casually and calmly that’s where we go, and not making a huge deal but it’s been 1.5 days and not a drop has made it in the potty.

Toddler Anxiety,"So my daughter has anxiety, or at least I think she does.  We will be seeing a specialist next month , who will also be looking into Asperger's .  When I am with her I am very very mindful of my tone and how I address it when she misbehaves, mostly because she is very very sensitive. But also because I have found that for us, having a calm conversation about what she did and why it was wrong works. Sometimes she goes in timeout but I dont ever yell at her and have never once told her I was 'mad' at her, or even upset with her.

&amp;#x200B;

lately anytime she does something, even something silly like dropping a toy she will look to me and ask if mommy is mad at her. I always assure her I am not , and even if its something like she spilled juice I am not mad because accidents happen but to be careful and she helps me clean it.  So I really have NO idea why she would think I was mad and I dont want her to feel nervous about anything all the time. Has anyone else's kids gone through a phase like this? Is it just a phase or something I should bring up with the behavioral specialist next month ?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: I am her sole parent, her dad has not even seen her in over a year, and hasnt really been a part of her life since she was an infant. So she is at a school/daycare when I am at work tues-Friday and with my mom on Saturdays. Other than that she is with me.",parenting

[UK] Help me suggest a new schedule?,"Split with my ex a year ago. Have a 5yo son who stays with me 3-4 days a week

Went to mediation to get court forms and they said the current schedule is really bad, a different bed every night.

I suggest a few new schedules to her but she tells me she works at a pub Friday/Saturday/Sunday nights.

4 year old obsessed with death and his grandma doesn’t respect boundaries with religion!,"Unfortunately we have had several deaths in the family back to back over the last few months. First my grandpa and then his wife my grandma six weeks later. Then we very suddenly lost our family dog to cancer. My older son was very close to my grandma, his GiGi and our dog had been with us before my son was born. 

He went to my grandma funeral and although I kept him within my sights at all time my mother (with whom I’ve had disagreements before) told my son that GiGi was waiting for him in the sky. We are raising our kids in a secular home as I am an atheist and my husband is unreligious. I’m deeply upset about it because I want him to grow up in influences by religion until he is old enough to make his own decisions which is something I never got in my childhood. I was forced to go to church. 

Ever since then my son has been telling literally everyone how Gigi and Stormy(our dog) have died. How they got sick and the doctors couldn’t help them and they DIED. Like he will literally yell across the street to total strangers. He will ask me if I’m going to die or if his little brother will die. He has even talked about going flying into the sky to see Gigi. 

He’s so confused and my mom has made everything a million times harder by not respecting my wishes on the topic of religion.  I get it. That’s how she’s coping with the loss of her mother but this is my child. I have talked to her about it but all she had was excuses as to why it wasn’t a big deal. My dad had to tell her to drop it to get her to agree. I told her that she is not allowed to talk to him any more about religion. I just hate that I have to do that especially since she is struggling without her mother and one of her brothers (I no longer call him my uncle) is threatening blackmail, extortion, and legal action regarding my grandmas decision to essentially give my mother everything because my mother was the only one to care for her in her old age. 

I have an appointment to take my son to see a child therapist at the end of the month. We unfortunately have a wait a while because yay US military healthcare! 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of situation? Is there anything else I can be doing to help him? He’s incredibly smart and understands a lot more than the average four year old. Any stories, tricks or tips to help my little boy understand death?",parenting
Looking for toys that will provide lots of entertainment in a semi-confined place for son (6) and daughter (4).,"Wife is visiting family that lives in a camper and taking the two kids (4 and 6) with her. Kids are pretty good and will have tablets and a bit of TV time but it would be better if they had some kids to engage them. They may be able to play outside a bit but that's going to be highly dependent on a lot of factors.

Just curious as to whether anyone has ideas of toys/games that could occupy kids for long periods of time in a smaller enclosed place. Considering a 'bigger' Lego set for my 6 year old, but the 4 year old could probably use something else.

"Kid ""shopping"" in our house - talk to her or parent?","My 8 yo daughter has a friend ""Sierra"" who comes over from time to time. Her mom asks if she can come here before or after school sometimes when school schedules change, and I'm glad to help. However, my kid is getting soured on Sierra because of this behavior: she sorta ""shops"" in our house. 

By this I mean she asks for things. Random things she likes. She is pretty pushy, too. Once it was a button box that belonged to my great aunt. She said she really liked it and asked ""Do you use this??"" I said it's a decoration and usually has buttons on it but my toddler dumped them. She said """"I would play with it all the time. Do you need it?"" I said it was my aunt's and I'm not giving it away.

After that visit my kid complained that Sierra asked for many things. My kid is pretty generous, though, and she made it worse I think by offering her a few toys. I told my kid not to offer to give Sierra anything bc it would encourage her to keep asking.

Next visit my kid forgot and Sierra asked again for other things, so my kid said no. I reminded her afterward to stop giving things away bc it encourages Sierra's asking. 

The last one was the last straw. My kid didn't offer her anything. But she got fixated on this little rock my kid got as a souvenir. It was on a shelf. She kept going on and on: ""I love rocks. I don't have one like that."" My kid said no, then asked Sierra to come in her room to play. Sierra said ""I'll only play with you of you give me that rock.""

I intervened and told her no, my kid said no, and it was her souvenir from x place so it's not ""just a rock ""

I would like to try dealing with this more directly before I give up. First off should I just talk to the kid next time she's over, or go through her mom? 

If I talk to her I was thinking of saying ""Sierra, it's not really nice to come over and ask to take people's things. I'm telling you this because we really like you, and I'm glad you think we have nice things, but when you ask and don't accept no for an answer it makes it hard for (my kid) to play with you. Please stop asking.""

Is that to much, not enough, etc?

I had an emotional meltdown,"I'll preface to say, we have good kids.  Really, they are good.  Two boys around the ages of 9-12.

He gets good grades at school, does his homework on time and on his own.  But other than that, at home he's just lazy and completely zoned out.  He plays minecraft non stop, online with a group of ""friends"".  They are either real life friends or friends he's met online.  He no longer asks for play dates with his real friends from school, or hangs out with kids in the neighborhood.

All he wants to do is play minecraft.  When he's told to practice his musical instrument, it's a fight.  When he has to go to his sporting practice, it's a minor battle.  When I want to do something outside the house, it's stomping around.

I realize I have created this monster by allowing access to electronics and never had  a strict limit on usage.  Yes I know I'll be judged for that, but the reality of it is, the entire household is tied to some for of electronic addition.  So, what do I do now?  I'm not asking him to give up his game, it's not affecting his school, but I just wish he would want some actual human interaction.

Last night, after another sports practice, he tells me he doesn't want to do it anymore.  Even though his coach recommended him to move up a level because he's shown improvement.  Then he kept stalling in practicing his music....I just broke down.  I don't know why but the tears would not stop falling.

My kids (14 M and 14 F) are bullying each other.,"They are twins and have always been quite different and competitive, but this school year is something else. They are in two very different, toxic cliques. My daughter is constantly making fun of my son for being a “nerd,” she’ll tell him to shut up whenever he’s talking about school, she and some of her friends stole his textbooks, and then they went to his academic decathlon meet in the guise of being supportive but actually just to torment him and his friends. 

My son and his friends, on the other hand, have called my daughter dumb/retarded and started a rumor about her taking meds because she’s crazy (she takes meds for ADHD). She is in a special needs class and my son and his friends have frequently made fun of her whole class. 

Both my son and daughter are being horrible to each other, and I’ve tried so hard to talk to them and discipline them for being bullied, but it hasn’t stopped. It’s usually better at home, like my son will help my daughter with homework and my daughter will listen to my son talk about what he’s learning at school, and they can talk to each other like normal humans, but as soon as they get to school they can be vicious.

I've read all the potty training books and I'm still clueless!!,"My kid turned three in August, started preschool in September and the potty training at the same time.

One month old strange behaviors,"So I have become a father. Somethings I see that are strange in my baby and then I search and see they are pretty common. Like the baby crossing his/her eyes.  

A few things I see that I don’t find on the internet. I am pretty sure they are normal but I thought it interesting for parents to share their experience. 

First one for me. If I touch in between my boy’s eyebrows, he immediately closes his eyes. This is quite useful for instance for when he is sleep and suddenly wakes up, I do this and he is back to sleep in 5 seconds. Off course going back to sleep is only when everything else is ok and he just managed to hit himself or something and wake up. 

I am interested to see if all babies are like that.",parenting

Am I in the wrong here? Just looking for an outsiders perspective.,"My mother in-law watches my two year old daughter while my husband and I work all day and normally there is no issues other than the usual insults to my parenting and modern-day parenting in general. 

Anyway, a few nights ago when I went to pick up my daughter I noticed she looked different but I couldn’t put my finger on it until I took out her pigtails and gave her a bath .... her hair was CUT. I was fuming, called my husband in to look at her hair and he didn’t see a difference or care (lol men) but I was/am SO upset. I wanted to grow her hair out and take her to her first haircut when I was ready. 
I argued with my husband to tell his mother to never, ever cut her hair again (I feel I should add that she is a retired hairdresser). He got all mad and said “she is just trying to help” and I said I didn’t care? You do not cut somebody else’s child’s hair without permission? You just don’t do that. Anyway, he told his mother and she said my child looked like she was homeless (she did NOT!!) and that she wanted to give her bangs. He said she got all mad and defensive and said some harsh things about me. 
So now, my daughter has bangs and I cannot get her hair into ponytails and pinned back the same way that I used to, I almost don’t know what to do with her hair anymore. 
I just went to drop her off for the first time since this started and I haven’t seen my MIL since the day of the actual haircut and she did not say a word to me. She greeted the baby and hugged her but didn’t even acknowledge that I was there. *eye roll* 
So, my question is .. was I right to be upset about her cutting my daughters hair or did I overreact? Or is MIL overreacting? Husband seems to think I overreacted but I’m not sure. I’m still pretty mad and upset.",parenting
Reusable diapering - help!,"Hello, everyone! First time poster in this sub. I am currently pregnant with my first, a little girl, and due in December. My husband and I have decided to go the reusable diapering route. We have put various brands and styles of reusables on our registry to try them out and see what works best for our lifestyle. We have also put a diaper sprayer, small trash can with a lid, and 2 washable trash can liners on our registry to aid with our chosen style of diapering. 

I have read a bit about reusable diapering, but was wondering if anyone has advice or tips for us. Specifically I am interested in tips for washing. Right now I am using a very simple laundry detergent which I buy from a local soap maker— it’s literally just a basic soap with nothing added. I LOVE it for our clothes, towels, and sheets, but I’m not sure it will cut it for keeping the diapers clean and stain-free. What is your diapering laundry ritual?

She's been doing it for awhile, its been constant.

How to break the truth to my 7 year old.,"First off I'd like to apologize if this a bit all over the place, I'm trying to get my thoughts straight and figure out the best way to do this.

To preface; My kids father, he passed away about 3 or 4 years ago now, he was a mean piece of work to me and my boy whom is 7 (Captain). Though never physical, it was all mental and emotional, mostly towards me, but he saw A LOT of it, which has made him protective of me, and his little sister whom is 5 (Tiny). We moved away from him in a sudden move, and we are doing a lot better, but the kids father, in between the 2 years we moved away and he passes away he saw the kids 3 times, and made no attempt to see them either, THEY DO NOT KNOW ANY FULL DETAILS. What came up yesterday while he was in school has me so confused I don't know what to do.

What happened: While in school Captian shared this ""My father died, he was a soldier who was fighting for Canada, and he died while fighting for Canada!"" 
Now hes increadably proud of this story, the problem is, it isn't true in the slightest. I have been seeing someone, who in the Air Force, so I think poor Captain has gotten the 2 of them confused and is trying to make up reasons why his father wasn't around. 
When I told him that he maybe getting my Boyfriend and his father confused (not the part of trying to figure out why his dad wasn't around) and that his father was just a regular person, it was like I broke his heart.

I'm having trouble trying to process all of this, as I have NO idea on how to break all this to him, obviously with this story coming about, I need to tell him, in an age appropriate way as to WHY his father was never around, and potentially why we moved away the way we did.

How can I do this? I wanted to protect him from the truth just a little longer.",parenting
I’m wondering if the expectations in my daughter’s kindergarten class are age-appropriate.,"My daughter just turned 5 two months before school started.  She was *through the roof* excited about going, and that level of enthusiasm continued for about two weeks after her first day of school.  The deeper we waded into the school year, however, the more her enthusiasm diminished.  That enthusiasm has now been replaced with anxiety about school and not being able to do her work, and we’re seeing emotional meltdowns about going to school in the mornings and at bedtime.

My wife and I have had multiple talks with her teacher about our daughter’s anxiety surrounding her work and not understanding it/being able to do it correctly, and she insists that my daughter needs to just keep trying when she’s having difficulty with something.  I agree with her to a certain point, but I also think that continuously trying and failing isn’t good for anyone if what they’re being asked to do is outside of their physical/cognitive developmental stage.  

As an example of the kind of work I’m questioning, my daughter was given a sheet that looked like this, and the expectation is that she ”read” the sentences and fill in the blanks:  

1. I ________ the 🎪.
2. I like _______ 🎡.
3. _______ like the 🐶.
4. I like 🍿 ______ 🥤.

So, again, I get that we need to keep trying when we don’t get something the first time, but I feel like this is too much for a kid who just turned five.  And the shift in her attitude toward school seems to indicate that as well.  

It may also be relevant that her physical size places her in only the third percentile for her age—she’s very small, and I don’t know if that means she’s developing a bit more slowly than other kids her age.  She’s also had ZERO history of anxiety until now.  

I’d appreciate any input and/or suggestions you all may have.  Thanks in advance.",parenting

4 year old getting picked on,"My son is in preschool and he loves it.  But I’ve noticed the past 2ish weeks, he is coming home angry and irritated.  He is meaner than usual to his sister, he hits me and laughs, and he started screaming answers. 

He has apraxia (that is improving more by each therapy session) so saying exactly what is bothering him is a little harder. He did say that 2 kids one big and one the same size as him were hitting him. He showed me them and I asked the teacher about my sons behavior and if he had friends he played with.  She assured me that she keeps a closer eye on the kids that can’t speak as well (2 kids with apraxia and a non verbal kid) because they tend to get more frustrated. It seems like every day I am getting a small”a kid pushed him so the kid got a time out” “him and another kid had a disagreement over a toy so they had to be separated” and I’m not saying that my kid is perfect,definitely not, but in every instance MY son is picking up toys and other kids aren’t wanting to help so they will try to pull it away. My son isn’t wrong by picking up toys or telling people they should pick up toys but I constantly tell him he can only control himself if they don’t want to help you can’t make them. 

Then yesterday I go to pick up my son and the teacher lets me know that a kid was pulling him as my son was cleaning up toys and they had to be separated. I was like look what the hell is going on. My kid is upset. Coming home upset. Upsetting my daughter. Everyone one is having a bad time. The teacher says “well he is having a hard time at home and he picks on all the students. He’s kind of a trouble maker and gets in trouble everyday. I’m sorry your son is getting picked on but the other kid is having a hard time” 

I get hard time at home. I am trying to be sympathetic but my son is there because of their speech pathologist not to be picked on and it’s truly unfair to him that his classmate is picking on him. I just don’t know a way to help my son deal with being picked on and a way to explain to him that it’s not his fault but to be nice to a kid that’s being mean back.",parenting
My son would have been 10 today. I miss him as much today as the day I lost him.,"(Sorry for dragging the subreddit through my healing process.)

A decade ago in a world that seems so far away, my son Aiden was born with a rare version of a rare Congenital Heart Defect called Unbalanced Atrioventricular Septal Defect (Unbalanced &gt; AVSD &gt; CHD). Despite the best efforts of a world renowned pediatric cardiovascular team of surgeons, doctors &amp; nurses, he died hours after a hybrid Fontan surgery in the CICU as I watched, unable to do anything. 

Words do no justice at describing the pain, sadness, anger and mixture of other emotions that come with losing your child. No amount of friends, family or well wishes make it any better. For years following his death, I spiraled deeper and deeper into depression and alcohol addiction, which was my way of numbing the intense feelings I had every single day.

Within 6 months of his death I'd lost everything. Not only my son, but my career, my house, my cars, my savings, friends, family and my marriage. I was homeless and for a while, unsuccessfully tried drinking myself to death. Historically today, and October 23rd (the day he died), I was always at my worst. Drinking more (if that's possible), caring less, etc.

For almost 5 years, I had no empathy for anyone or anything. I emotionally hurt, took advantage, manipulated, lied and stole from people, being drunk 90% of the time and blacked out the other 10. Important to note that prior to his death I didn't drink or behave at all like this. I'm lucky I didn't kill anyone for having drove intoxicated so many times before I got a DUI. Luckily for me, I actually stayed off the road after that. 

Around my lowest point, I was approached by a man who served me with child support paperwork. Turned out that a year prior, a night of promiscuousness with a woman at a bar I met ended up in pregnancy and I was never told. In complete shock, I stopped drinking long enough to power on a laptop and run some backgrounds. Turns out I fathered a child with a convicted child abuser (multiple times even -- with bodily injury). 

All I could think about was a promise I made before my son died that I would protect him from anything for as long as I had breath. I reeled myself off the edge, slowed the drinking, got a software engineering position &amp; started studying family law. In  6 months I was stable enough, had established enough of a relationship with my son and had collected enough evidence that directly related to my son to reasonably file for custody myself (no attorney).

I kept working on myself, quit drinking entirely and had met a woman through a support group who was recovering from the death of her first born daughter from a similar heart defect as my son. While I wasn't looking (at all) for a relationship, the connection I had with this person who went through something as terrible as I was something I couldn't ignore. 

Within a years time I was awarded sole physical and legal custody of my son (he was a little over a year old at the time) and I'd  started dating the woman who lost her 1st daughter. Turns out she has a daughter now too, 5 months younger than my son. 

Today, we're married and in addition to having a son of our own, we've legally adopted each other's children. We've both done a ton of work on ourselves to process and cope with the death of our 1st born in healthy ways. It is not easy. Even today, many years sober with no relapse, when I think about him, I choke up and hold back tears. 

After 10 years I've convinced myself that had my son lived his quality of life would have been awful. I've also convinced myself that even if I relived the moment 100 times, no decision I made would have resulted in a different outcome. (I was moving to having him flown to the East Coast to have an operation with a mitral valve specialist &amp; the worlds #1 cardio surgeon but he had a heart attack before the flight and I opted for surgery in Denver). Even so, when I come across something about an advancement in leaky mitral valves being repaired with higher success rates, it's bittersweet. 

No matter how much I love my 3 living kiddos and all that we do together (which is a lot), I will always have a missing piece of my heart. What I'm sad about the most is the life I wasn't able to give my son and that he never got to understand how much I love him. I base my parenting off of that fact though and not a day goes by where I don't show &amp; tell my kiddos how much I love them. Life can be here one moment and gone the next.

My 2 month old drinks 6oz of formula every 4 hours,So my 2mo son is 24 1/2 tall (landing him in the 80th % range) and 11.11 lbs (landing him in the 30th % range). He drinks 6oz of milk every 3-4 hours where every parenting website says 2 month olds should only be eating 4oz every 4 hours. If I try to feed him 4 he just acts hungry until I feed him again. I know he won’t take more than he’s hungry for but I’m worried I’m over feeding him. His pediatrician says he’s okay as long as he stays in the low range for weight. Any Advice??,parenting
Am I ruining soccer for my kid?,"My 8 year old son loves soccer. It's his 3rd year playing recreational soccer. The club focuses on fun over fundamentals... unless you're willing to pay for additional skills programs. Club relies on volunteer parents who have little-to-no training for rec teams. These volunteers help keep fees low and this attracts lots of families looking to put their kids in anything that's affordable and will get them out of their hair for a couple hours a week. 

In 3 seasons, he's never had a ""winning"" season - always lost many more games than won. He's reasonably skilled and understands the importance of playing positions and strategy.

He's starting to get disillusioned and has been expressing that he doesn't want to go to soccer. He's frustrated that most of the kids on his team have no clue how to play (which is true cause of the club's approach). I keep telling him to focus on being a leader and setting a good example of teamwork... but he's done hearing it and I'm getting done saying it (though I believe in those ideals).

I can't afford to move him to a more competitive club/league at this time but I'm worried he's going to hate soccer over this. We both want him to learn and develop his skills but we're both losing hope with this club/league.

BTW, I coached for two seasons and most of the parents couldn't give a crap whether their kid wins or loses. Most sit in their cars during practices and games.

Anyone have any experience in similar situation? Constructive advice appreciated.",parenting

"Books for a bossy, overbearing 6-year old girl?","Title says it all - DD is bossy and overbearing while playing and it alienates her from her friends. She gets fixated on imaginary play scenarios and can’t let go when her friends don’t want to go along with the characters/scenarios she envisages, resulting in complete meltdowns whenever she has a play date. She also finds it really hard to disengage to calm down and wants to keep arguing her point, shouting about why she is right and the other person is wrong. The conflicts only occur with other children - at school she is very eager to please and her teachers think she’s a model student, but everything falls apart in the playground!

I found out the hard way today that my toddler can open doors,"My 16 month old and I were visiting my aunt today, it was getting close to dark. I let my LO run off and play while I was chatting with my aunt. We were talking for a while, and then I noticed that it was suspiciously quiet. 

I went around to the kitchen where I had last seen my LO, and the door to the garage was open, as was the garage. I freaked. I had no idea how long she had been gone. I screamed for my aunt and took off running, and there was my LO at the end of the yard near the street (my aunt lives in a subdivision) yelling “mama! Mama!” 

Man, that has to be the scariest thing that has ever happened to me since becoming a parent. Friendly reminder to lock your doors and get door handle covers if you have a toddler.",parenting
Toddler Atypical Speech Patterns,"This is a bit long, but I would love to hear from any parents or speech therapists with experience with the these particular atypical speech patterns mentioned below:

My son will be 3 soon. He speaks in full sentences but is very hard to understand. He uses filler sounds (usually ""hnn"" or ""ng"")  for words he can't say and has trouble with some vowel sounds. For example, he pronounces ""car"" as ""cnng."" And ""two"" is ""tnn."" He recognizes letters and numbers up to at least 11, but he doesn't actually say most of the numbers--he'll say ""one, tnn, tnn, tnn, hnn, hnn, hnnn, eight, nine, tnn, eleven!"" But he can easily identify the written numbers. This is just mentioned as an example--his speech is filled with these substitutions/filler sounds. His intonation/number of syllables is correct though.

We've been working with a speech therapist through the county since he was about 20 months, and recently had an evaluation with private insurance. He tested extremely behind his peers (in language) but too young to say for sure if he has a motor planning disorder such as apraxia. 

His receptive language skills are very high and he loves to eat. I haven't noticed any unusual sensory issues. He can use a straw, spoon, etc. He enjoys being with other children but is generally more quiet and reserved. 

He's getting very discouraged when I try working with him at home. We've been working on the long ""oo"" sound and he tends to pronounce it more like ""ee"" in isolation and then cut out the vowel completely if it's paired with a consonant like ""t"" or ""c."" But he can say ""moo"" and ""boo;"" they just sound a little more like a blend between ""oo"" and ""ee.""

He was starting to stutter (but seems to be subsiding), cover his face, and say he can't do it or doesn't know how. He doesn't like making mistakes or being put on the spot and would rather not try at all. I really don't want him to be discouraged but also want to help him as much as possible. 

He also almost always refers to himself in the third person. 

We have had him evaluated for hearing issues and by an ENT. Everything is fine. 

I would greatly appreciate any insights/experiences. We are working with a lot of people but I would love to just have an answer and figure out how I can best help him.

Edit: Thank you so much to all who responded! I should add that everyone we've worked with has been wonderful; I am just trying to seek out all avenues of information possible--you never know what might help. He's been responding really well to low-pressure therapy snuck in throughout the day. I also have been supplementing with a fun YouTube channel called Yak Back Pack. Again, thank you for the responses and kind words!",parenting
Healing after Miscarriage,"I had a miscarriage this year on Valentine’s Day. My Cupid baby didn’t make it but I’m due in 2 months with a little girl and all these people keep asking if it’s my first and I never know what to say.. 
I usually say “technically” and hope people move on, but I don’t ever want to stop saying it because I never want to forget my baby yet at the same time I don’t want to go into detail about it because although I think I’m over it, it still hurts to talk about. 
I got a little outfit the first time I found out I was pregnant the first time and I know that I’ll be keeping that forever. And that my little girl is coming home in that outfit. 
I don’t always think about it but when I do, its near and dear to me and it means a lot to me. It was one of the most painful things I’ve ever gone through but at the same time I’m so thankful to meet my other little girl any day now. I often wonder if my husband thinks about it as much as I do, because I don’t feel like he does. What I do know is I wish I could’ve met that baby. Wether or not it would’ve been a boy or a girl.

Concerned with daughters severe reactions to getting in trouble,"I have a 4yr old daughter who is lovely most of the time but like any young kid, she does the wrong thing occasionally and getting into trouble is something she really dislikes. We have recently moved away from my home country (Australia) to my wife’s home country (Colombia) and since then I have noticed some disturbing reactions from her when she is in trouble for something. While on some occasions when she has done something accidentally, she understands that she did something wrong and will immediately apologise and we’ll move on. But now on a few occasions when I tell her she has done something wrong (even if it hasn’t been anything major) her reaction is, along with sulking, to start scratching at her skin and telling us that “she wants to take her skin off”. Today’s episode she left scratch marks across her cheeks and my wife and I had to physically stop her from scratching more and potentially really hurting herself. 
We are and have always been a loving family. We show her plenty of love, attention and affection and any arguments with her or my wife (we don’t argue very often, and when we do it’s not loud or physical). 
So we are not really sure where this has come from and/or if it would be considered as something relatively normal for young kids? Maybe it’s become her way of coping/feeling better while she’s trying to settle in to a new kindy at a new country that she doesn’t speak the language? Maybe she isn’t getting the same attention in this hectic settling in period? I don’t know... Help!",parenting
Extending bedtime for 2 yo - Any advice or tips?,"For the last few nights, and on &amp; off for a few weeks, my LO has been up past 8 or 9pm babbling to herself in bed.

We keep everything calm and relaxing for 30-60 minutes before preparing for bed, have kept the same routine pretty much since she slept in her own room. How do I go about changing her sleeps schedule without making things worse? Her nap is anywhere from 1-2 hours in the afternoon, usually around 11-12 depending on if she got up early or had a really active morning. I’ve read that awake time between naps and sleep should be like 5-6 hours, and I’ve tried to put her down later but she ends up being overtired and crazy wound up!

I don't want to lie to my kids,but man I don't know how to explain death the a near 3 year old!!

Miss diagnosis?,"I need some guidance/advice on how to deal with my sons situation cause i feel like I'm losing my mind.

The problem is that i just don't see autism in him &amp; feel like I'm crazy. He's now 4 years old &amp; keeps getting the same diagnosis but i still don't see it! All i see is minor things that can easily be learned. 

He does have an obvious speech delay but is progressively getting better even without speech therapy (will start getting it soon). He has an older brother (6 years old) &amp; he's able to do every single thing he can except the verbal part. I definitely see a receptive delay where he doesn't fully comprehend some things i tell him or others. But i just don't see autism in him. He looks completely normal! If he could just comprehend &amp; speak clearly you wouldn't even be able to tell he has anything. Now I'm not trying to sound in denial or ignorant but it's really how i feel about it but i keep getting told otherwise. I'm very open minded &amp; willing to accept facts when its clearly in my face. 

While raising him I'll admit i was a shit parent because i did nothing to teach him things as i was going through an extreme amount of stress. My son was basically raised being enclose inside an apartment with not much interaction which i feel had a big effect on him.

Toilet adventures travelling with a toddler,"I am the father of a 22 month old girl. My daughter has been potty trained recently but there are still times when my wife and I put on a pull up diaper if we are driving more than an hour or if we are taking a flight since there are still a lot of false positives. On a recent trip, my wife was not feeling well so I went shopping with my daughter. Mod way through our trip at the mall, she had bowel movement and she didn't give any sort of indication so she did it in the pull up diaper. Since she usually gets fussy with a dirty diaper, I took her to the men's toilet to change her diaper since there was no family restroom in the mall. As it turns out, the men's restroom didn't have a diaper changing station. Since the floors of public restrooms are never clean, I didn't want to change the diaper on the floor or even put the diaper changing pad on the floor as my daughter usually starts panicking when she put flat on the floor and wouldn't stay in one place to give me enough time to change the diaper. As a result, I went from one store to another in the mall asking if they had a family restroom and after 35-40 minutes, we landed at Nortstrom where they had family restroom with a diaper changing station. 

This isn't the first time that I have had trouble finding a public restroom with diaper change station or even a family restroom. A lot of times I have to just rely on my wife to get the diaper changed since men's restrooms won't have diaper changing stations.  It is a bit hard to believe that it's not a mandatory requirement to install a diaper changing station in all public men's and women's restrooms.

I think rejection is a tough part of growing up.,"I never realized it would possibly be tougher as an observing parent. My 7th grade daughter wanted to meet up with some friends at the park today. Only one that she knew showed up and there were 3 others she wasn’t exactly friends with, but I think she is trying to branch out and broaden her friendships. Well these kids aren’t great company and I think/hope she learned a bit about these types of people today. 

She was there for maybe 5 minutes and came back to the car ready to leave. She told me they (except one boy) pretty much snubbed her and then decided to walk over to the McDonalds nearby and she said she couldn’t go with them. The one boy said “ok see you ‘H’”and the two girls there said “ok f*ck off”

I was pretty pissed at first. I could feel the heartbreak in her voice but she told me “it’s whatever”. She then told me all the kids except the boy who said bye to her  use Juuls and she didn’t care about them. I suspect part of her did but I’m really glad that she didn’t attach to trash people like that anyway. I know they probably can’t help being shitty people who probably come from shitty parents but it’s hard not to jump in and protect my baby. 

I was there once and being rejected by a social group has happened to most of us to an extent. I know sometimes she has to go through these things without mom holding her hand. I just tell her I’m always there to talk if she needs.",parenting
"Worried because my 1 year old is acting tired all of the time, normal or not?","My daughter turns one this week. She’s my first so this is all new to me and I don’t know what to expect at this age. For the past few weeks she seems a lot more tired! She’ll take two naps a day, one in the morning for about an hour after she’s been awake for about 2-3 hrs and one in the late afternoon. Her sleeping schedule is all over the place right now, sometimes she’ll go to bed at 8 pm, which is when I try to lay her down, other times she won’t fall asleep until 10. I’m really worried because no matter how much sleep she gets she seems tired. She’ll shake her head back and forth (which I’ve read is an indication of tiredness) after only being awake for an hour, sometimes she’ll do this all day long. 

I took her to the doctor awhile ago because she was acting like she was in pain and tugging at her ear, she had an ear infection and took an antibiotic for ten days. It seems like the pain has definitely gone away, but I don’t know what to make of her being so sleepy. It scares me that her pediatrician missed something or she needs to go back. I don’t want to make a big deal out of something that’s just normal behavior, but I don’t want to ignore something that could potentially be serious either. 

She also will barely eat since this started too, she’s been on solids since six months, she’s never been that interested but she would eat! Now she will barely take two bites before she’s screaming and has had enough. Could this all be related to teething? I’m making her an appointment tomorrow but appreciate any insight!",parenting

My toddler drinks less than a koala. Halp!,"The daily struggle to get her to take in 12oz is wearing on me. 

Outside of soup, my two and a half year has a general disdain for liquids. She will happily eat soup, though rowing with the spoon is past her attention span at times, but she'll finish her portion if given a straw. Plain or chocolate milk is also a yes, but everything else - juice, water - is a hard pass. When she does take a sip, it's just to shake us, small tiny sip that she puts down before she can take in any liquid. Her teachers remark that she doesn't touch liquids at snack and meal time. This aversion to what is good for her caused a (now recurring) and incredibly painful anal fissure. 

Pediatrician had us put her on Miralax to help heal the fissure, which worked but then it was time to wean her off the polyethylene glycol, and rather predictably after a few months were back at start. To the extent that she can understand it, we make the connection between not drinking and tummy and bum pain abundantly clear. 

The only time I can get her to drink is with threats or bribes. In such a scenario she can put down a kid sized bottle of juice in under 10 minutes as she did today on the way home from daycare.

Why will my 2 year old suddenly not sleep?,"My kid has been pretty easy as far as sleep goes most of his life. I mean, he didn’t really sleep through the night til over a year, but he’s usually fine with going to bed. But for the last week it has been a nightmare. 

He will willingly go and get in bed, but as soon as I turn out the lights, he starts screaming. He needs a different color sippy cup, he needs a toy, but not that one. He will scream “I want it” over and over. No idea what “it” is. If I ask, it’s “that one!” Then “I want that one, over there”. But there’s none that I see. A couple nights ago I asked him to show me. So he got out of bed and did a couple laps around the kitchen island saying “need that one” over and over, looking. Never found out what it was, but he keeps wanting it. 

And bedtime has turned into a 1-2 hour fight. Please tell me this is temporary. We didn’t change his schedule, and nothing else has changed.

I need reassurance,"I have a soon to be 21 month old son.
I’m a stay at home mom and I’m 24 weeks pregnant
My son doesn’t speak very many words very well yet. I’m not worried about it. He seems to have decent word recognition and comprehends basic requests.
BUT 
him not being able to communicate very wl, I think is what’s contributing to his meltdowns and his very rough demeanor. 
I find myself yelling and getting frustrated more often. I wasn’t this way before I was pregnant, but we also had thrown ourselves into the thick of the hitting, whining,and screaming. (And does anyone else’s toddler go on “sprees” of just into everything, hitting or pinching the dog, or trying to destroy the house?) I was always one to just redirect or just calmly explain and not I’m just “No! I SAID NO!” And I can literally tell myself five seconds after “that wasn’t calm, or productive parenting”. We use timeouts but again he’s still limited on how much it affects him at under two.
I know it’s “normal” and it’s part of toddlerhood. But it’s getting hard for me to feel like I can take him anywhere cause I feel embarrassed and like a bad parent. I’m feeling like a bad mom and like other people around me are judging me for his behavior. But how much can I do at this age, he only has so much understanding or care for what I’m saying.
I’m struggling to keep some sanity and some semblance of good parenting. I’m trying to be introspective about it and better myself but I’m also just feeling like my toddler is worse behavior wise and like it’s my fault.
Also, I’m getting very anxious about managing him and a newborn. Like I’m struggling with this now how am I going to do this with a newborn? I know people do it every day. I know you have to just find what works but holy cow am I worried.",parenting
2 Year Old Veggie Monster,"I think this is a common problem, just an uncommon version.  At 2 years old, we have no problem getting him to eat all kinds of veggies, fruit, or crackers, but proteins will cause some of the highest quality two-year tantrums he is capable of.

Kindergarten...help!,"We have been having trouble with my son in kindergarten. I knew that there would be a tough transition because he came from home to half-day kindergarten. However he has spent plenty of time in structured activities like church, and we have routines at home.

I didn't want to be the over worried first time parent, so I have left the teacher alone. Honestly, I have said hello to her and once I did ask about how he was doing and she gave me a really vague response ""We are gently working with him."" Okay, sounds good. Teacher is older oh, so I figured no news is good news.

Fast forward to last week. She takes me aside at pickup and tells me that my sweet 5 year old who wouldn't hurt a fly is being physical with other kids and that he is being defiant with her. I told her we were experiencing a little defiance at home too and that we were working on it. She tells me she is putting him on a behavior plan. I still don't know what the end goal of this is.

Today I was talking to her, and she said that I seemed frustrated with the situation. I told her yes I was because I hadn't received any communication from her about this behavior and I was frustrated. She then told me it was my responsibility to be asking about his behavior. The problem is, I feel I opened the door by asking about his behavior early on. She could have told me about his behavior at that time but chose not to.

What would you do in my situation?,"So today at work, I work at a daycare, my son was in his classroom and I walked in there to get him. He had scratches that were straight up and down on the back of his neck. No knowing that he is 4 months old and the state ratio for infants to teachers is one teacher to five infants I know it can be stressful back there because that's mainly my classroom. However the teacher that was in there my coworker, blamed it on his bib scratching him. Now his bid was fastened and if a bib scratched him it would be a bunch of little scratches but no it looks like somebody physically took their nails and scratched him on purpose. I took it to my manager and my manager took it to my boss and now I have a meeting with that co-worker tomorrow morning. But I honestly do not want to talk to her at all I honestly want her fired.",parenting
"School troubles. I don’t know if I’m justified in feeling this way, and I need a reality check.","Hi fellow parents! I need a reality check, I honestly don’t know if I’m just being sensitive because things have been stressful lately and it’s just coming out sideways. So I’m asking your help in bringing me back down to earth...                   
So my 5 year old just started kindergarten this year, he’s doing ok, he struggles with his numbers and letters a little and I’ve been working with him at home too. He’s improved quite a bit in a short time but the teacher did request an IEP, teacher sent home a letter about starting IEP, I approved and requested a call from teacher to discuss anything else I could be doing at home to help. That was 3-4 weeks ago and have not gotten a call, despite another email I sent asking again. I do know he started the IEP because he told me. Ok I get it, teachers are busy and he seemed to be really improving so I left it alone.                                                                     
So my sons kindergarten teacher also had his older cousin in her class a few years ago (older cousin is in 5th grade now) and his classes are in the same building still. But today, older cousin tells me teacher pulled him aside and asked him to work on numbers and letters with him at home when he sees him and that my little guy is struggling. And this is where I don’t know if I’m overreacting...                                                
I don’t know, but I don’t really like that she shared that with him, especially since I haven’t gotten a call from her. I’m kinda angry but I don’t know if I really should be, it feels violating almost. And we’re close with older cousin and all but I don’t know, I feel like it was out of line for her to say that to him and request that he work with him when she hasn’t even spoke to me. I haven’t done anything about this, other than mutter to myself about it, but I thought I’d ask you folks...am I being crazy? Is this really not a big deal and I’m just being sensitive? There’s been a lot of other stress going on atm so I honestly don’t 100% trust myself and I could easily be making a mountain out of a molehill. So parents, am I justified in feeling angry about this or do I need to shut my crazy head up? TIA!",parenting

Is 5 too young for a Nintendo switch?,"My 4 year old son desperately wants one. My husband and I aren’t super strict on tv time, we do limit that and iPad usage sometimes but aren’t overly worried about it. My son gets 30 min of iPad time a few times a week. He has an old Nintendo DS that my MIL got him from a garage sale, he plays that sometimes too (the kid is OBSESSED with Mario &amp;amp; Luigi). My husband was on board with getting him one for Christmas but I told him I think he’s too young. We are contemplating waiting until 5 but I also feel like what’s the rush? It’s expensive and he’s so small, he should be playing outside 😂

"Pleeeease no judgement on this one but I want to get my 4 year old a mobile phone, need advice on devices or advice on how to work around my concerns?","I’m a single parent, I work full time and have a pretty demanding job, but I’m trying my best to give my child the best possible life, so as you can imagine this sometimes means leaving my child with other family members and friends etc. 

There was a situation where my grandma fell really ill out of the blue, my little one knows how to ring the police but her phone was out of reach. The phone is now in reach and now that she is ill she rarely has him when she’s not feeling well etc etc. But my point is accidents happen, and it could have been a lot worse, I just wish my child had a way of getting help in any situation. 

I pick him up on a Friday and go back to work on Monday, and I have always been terrified incase something happens to me on the Friday, and it wouldn’t be till Monday that anyone would notice our absence from school and work. He can open the fridge and turn on Netflix, so he’s pretty self sufficient 😂 but still, hopefully you catch my drift. 

I just feel if he had a device that made it easy to contact me or my mum and sisters etc, then a lot of bad situations can be avoided. I did see a V Kids Watch that sounded good, you can send voice messages and SOS alerts, as well as being able to monitor it from my phone. My child also has separation issues since his dad stopped seeing him years ago, and he panics sometimes thinking I will forget to pick him up, so I like the idea of being able to send him a voice message so he knows I’m thinking of him. 

I also realise that maybe I’m being a little over protective, and maybe I need to stop bubble wrapping him, so in that case my other question would be how can you stop yourself getting so wrapped up in worrying?!  

I realise giving a 4 year old a phone sounds insane, and I’m hardly going to go out and buy him an iPhone 11, so please no judgement 😬

**Edit** I taught him to use Siri on mobile phones, but Siri can be a royal pain in the ass, and my grandparents are pretty much the only people to have landlines anymore",parenting
College Freshman Struggles,"My son is a college freshman(18) and is struggling. He developed poor study habits in High School, but was smart enough to get by.  He is like a lot of college freshmen, has some anxiety as well as not being overly confident socially.  In the first two weeks of college, he was convinced he was going to get a 4.0 because everything was easy and week by week I have seen that confidence degrade.  He is now consistently mentions that he cant concentrate and cant get anything finished.  He has not said said it specifically, but I think he has convinced himself that he has ADHD and wants to get on medicine.  I am fairly confident he is missing some classes and not handing in all his assignments. I am also fairly confident he is partying pretty regularly,  although I don't know if it is more than average or not.    


My dilemma is that he is coming home this weekend for the first time and I am not sure how to approach things with him. He can get pretty defensive and shuts down at times, so I am trying to think through how to have a discussion with him.    Maybe I should just leave it alone and let him figure out on his own.

How old is too old to dress up for Halloween and trick or treat? My 12 year old still wants to go.,"My oldest is 12 and wants to go trick or treating with friends this year. Last year he stayed home and handed out candy. This year he wants to go again. 

I feel like 12 is getting a bit up there in age and I don't really want to shell out money for a costume since I have two other kids to buy for. I never trick or treated at this age. Will most people still give candy? Does it come across as disrespectful, greedy, or trashy at that age?

Kids don't want to go on 8th grade trip,"So long story short, I have twin daughters in the 8th grade at a small private school (they are in a class with 10 kids total). Every other year, the combined 7th and 8th grade classes go to a local camp for 2 nights. There is teacher supervision and no parents going. My daughters are both on the ""outside"" of the class group of girls. They are both extremely shy and just overall anxious. Both have expressed numerous times over the past year that they don't want to go. I met with the principal today who was kind, but made it clear all students are expected to attend the trip. I know overall it's probably best to have them go... but part of me wants to just let them skip it.

Terrible 2s: Being a Kid vs Intentional,"The twos were hard for my first daughter (now 4) but for my second (just over 2), I’m beyond words as to her behavior. It seems different than just reacting to not getting her way or in the interest of instant gratification, which children often strive for. She seems to want to cause others pain or be difficult. Here are some examples:

- Walking in a park, she’ll just stop and wait for someone to come get her. We’ve left her standing there for a long time but she won’t budge. 

- For close to a year now she will bite her sister or others at the slightest frustration. 

- She’s constantly instigating with her older sister, trying to get a reaction out of her/us. 

Obviously the first place to look is you (me) as the parent. Am I giving her enough attention? Is she holding onto some anger from the rules we enforce? 

I’m trying so hard to be patient and to show her that she is loved, but to no avail. 

Any suggestions? 😬",parenting
"12yr old suspended right before family vacation, need advice","I don’t quite know where to start. I’ve never posted here but...

My husband and I have been planning a surprise Disneyworld trip for our two kids (12) and (8) for the last year. We are now 1 week away and found out this morning that (12) is going to be suspended and possibly for the rest of the semester. We are so blindsided by this, in addition to dealing with the suspension, I don’t know what to do about this vacation. We can’t cancel it now, and I feel like shipping him off to grandparents would be unnecessarily cruel. On the other hand I don’t want him to think his behavior has been positively rewarded.

Anyone who has been in a similar situation or has any advice, please help. I’m feeling pretty lost...

EDIT: I posted below but his friends had online world building like D&amp;D but they made a micronation. In there people would create threads and one asked what role they would have in the nation and gave options: sniper, general, army, navy and why they should get the role. My kid responded sniper and said things like “I’ll be the sniper, tell me who your enemies are and they’ll be gone. I’ll use a gun(can’t remember what kind he said)...” etc. this was on his school computer. It was reported as a threat so he has been suspended for it. I agree that it was a colossally stupid thing for him to do and I also understand that any gun threat has to be taken very seriously, but I don't know if its send him away bad.

Also, this is the only Disney trip we're planning on taking. We've never been and don't plan on doing this again.",parenting

7yo always upset/crying,"Hi all, looking for some advice for my 7yo..

I'll get straight to the point, my 7yo is constantly sad or upset. She's such a sensitive soul and takes everything either literal, or to heart. If I tell her off (even simply just telling her nonchalantly) she thinks I hate her and cries. She gets jealous of her 3yo sister so it can be difficult to be loving with her infront of my 7yo, because she accuses me of loving her more than my 7yo and will then cry. If I say anything remotely negative (correcting her when we learn her spellings for example) she will cry. I put them both to bed tonight and my 7yo was singing and my 3yo was asking her to stop so she could sleep (they like sharing a bunk bed/room even though they have seperate rooms), I asked her to please stop and she again cried. You can't play games with her because if she loses, she cries. I love to play Roblox with her but if I do something she didn't want me to do she will cry. 

She gets quite upset with our family situation too. She will stay at our house half of the week and her grandparents the other (her father/my ex still lives with them). She has a really strong bond with me and her grandparents. The thing is she cries whenever she is at one because she misses the other. Today she cried as her grandparents dropped her off because she wanted to stay with them but does the same for me when she goes to their house. I hear her cry in bed at night because she misses them and has mentioned that she cries because she doesn't want them to die (as far as i'm aware they are completely healthy 50 somethings!). 

She's cried a few times the past few days because she feels like she doesn't get enough time to see everyone she loves because of school (which can't be helped). 

I'm not sure how to handle it all in the best way for her. Atm when shes upset she asks to cuddle so tonight we lay in my dressing gown and cuddled chatting about school etc. Because we are so close we usually cuddle anyway but when she's sad I tend to take time out just for her. Apart from that i'm stumped on how to help her. I don't know if she's hormonal or what, but my heart aches for her. 

I've taken her to her GP in the past few months for symptoms I thought were pointing to procotious puberty, but was told she's a healthy normal 7yo. I don't know how else to help her so any advice is welcome",parenting
Daycare teacher,"My twins are 3 years old and just started daycare this past August. I feel the need to add some background to this- the twins were born at 25 weeks gestation and have had delays their entire life. We also think they are on the spectrum (we are on the waiting list to get them tested). They are in a great classroom and I like their teachers.

But here is my issue. One of the teachers in the room next to my kids classroom goes to church with my grandfather (small town issues). His wife, my step grandmother, has brain cancer and breast cancer. My grandparents were not a huge part of my life, my dad oded when I was young and wasn't part of my life before that. My entire life the only time they were involved in my life was whenever I reached out first. Also, last time I went to see my grandparents was in August and they didn't ask about my kids and talked about her great grandkids nonstop. Then I was told by someone that my step grandmother said not very kind things about my twins.

Okay, so back to the daycare teacher- today I was walking down the hall to pick the twins up and she stops me and ask if I was still working at _____ and I told her no but that I had been working at _____ , I was being friendly. Then she has the nerve to tell me that my grandfather's wife isn't doing well and questioned me the last time I went and saw them. She was a complete bitch to me. She also said more, I was in shock i don't think i even comprehended what she said. 

So obviously what she did was out of line. My family disfunction has nothing to do with her. Should I go see my grandparents- idk. But I know it's not her place to tell me I need to. 

Should I tell the daycare director or should I just drop it and avoid the teacher? What would you do? Also, I hate conflict and my kids go to this daycare for free because they get their therapies there, I don't want to ruin a good thing for them because of one issue that I can mostly avoid if needed.",parenting
"Full time working parents and ""needy"" children - set up to fail","Both of us work full time, M-F, similar hours. He's the breadwinner, but I have a good job in a field I'm going to school for, which is good for the resume. However, our son was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. We just found out the BCBA has suggested 20 hours per week of therapy for his diagnosis and particular problems. 

20 hours per week. I work 40 hours per week. Commute up to 1.5 hours total each day. My husband works 40-60 hours per week. He can't take a day off without requesting 3 years in advance. So I'm the one who takes care of things like this, including when the daycare calls to come get him because he's being a nightmare, doctor visits, etc. 

How do you work full time and still take care of your kids that need above and beyond the ""minimum"" without losing your job or mind? I say minimum like that because most people have to work full time in order to live so they see their kids when they can and make the most of the time they get with them as long as physically and mentally possible. In other words, my kid sees his daycare and soon to be therapist more than he sees me during a week. Life of a lower middle class family.",parenting

My 4 year old needs so much more attention and direction than I can give him right now, with a newborn. Or, do I just suck at this?

I'm considering putting my 4 year old in pre-k for 4 days a week....the problem is, I feel like I've failed at being a stay at home mom. My husband is the only one that works so that I can stay home with the kids. At this point though I feel like it would be so much more beneficial to my older kid to be in school most of the week, with activities and direction, instead of me constantly saying ""hold on"".

I gave birth to my beautiful baby on Sunday as a stillborn,"I never thought that I would ever suffer a miscarriage. I never thought that I would be the one grieving of my own child’s loss. I always praised God for allowing me to have two heathy pregnancies and thanked him for keeping that kind of suffering from my life. Now I’m in a nightmare. 

Now I can’t stop crying or looking at the photos I have of her. I can’t believe that at 37 weeks and 7 days I would deliver my beautiful baby girl dead to this world. I wish I could have given her life. I wish I could have a reason as to WHY. But I don’t.

Yes, we are seeking counseling, but I feel myself losing my mind with my grief. My chest is heavy and as a mother I hate looking in the mirror and not seeing my huge belly. 

I knew at about 20 weeks that God told me she would come early, I just didn’t know she would come early this way. 

I’m angry that I only brought home a piece of paper and a few items to remember her by. I’m angry that my perfect little girl had to be called to heaven so early. I’m angry and enraged that I don’t get to sing lullabies to her, to read her all the bedtime stories, to experience all of the firsts with her. That I don’t get to love her the way I love my son. That I don’t get to watch her grow and learn. 

I’m so lost. I feel for any mother and father out there that has lost a child at any age or gestation. No words I can say or anyone can say bring any comfort. 

My husband and I are planning a celebration of life for her. We are having her cremated because I can’t bare to bury my baby somewhere and leave her to rot. (That’s how I view it). Although I will admit that my husband has done the most part of If because I can’t get my shit together. But I’m working on making myself strong so I can give her the most beautiful celebration I can possibly muster.

Do you really put EVERYTHING away that a toddler shouldn’t play with?,"This morning my almost two year old was in my bathroom while I was doing my routine with my face, wash face, makeup. It doesn’t take too long and she has bracelets and other things of mine she plays with plus her potty and books and a teddy bear. Usually she likes to get up on the step to open my drawer and I am okay with it because I’m supervising. Most of it is fine except for a few things. I’m just too tired to concentrate on organizing everything so I just let it be and supervise off the corner of my eye. Sometimes she will take a lipstick and I show her how I do mine and joke by pretending to put some on her. She is most interested in opening and closing it. Also I have perfumes on a tray near the sink which I let her smell. I try to teach her not to put near her nose too much. And to be careful with them since they are encapsulated in glass, still catching any possible accidents and discipline again and so forth. She likes taking the tops off mostly. Also I have a little portable shelf sitting in the middle of the counter against the mirror that has my facial serums in droppers and lotions. She will sometimes take them out and I repeat to be gentle. As long as I have the caps tightly sealed I am okay with it for now. 

Well, she dropped a perfume bottle today and it was luckily okay so I kind of got irritated after having told her that they can brake (she knows the word) and to be gentle. She tried grabbing it again and I raised my voice, well more like almost a yell, “don’t touch it!” And she cried. I felt horrible and my husband said to me it was my responsibility to put anything dangerous away not hers. I was tired and woke up earlier than usual, of course I felt bad for yelling but then I told him if I put this away then I’d have to put everything away. She still gets to things all the time. We baby proofed the house but I have taught her not to grab picture frames and certain items which she doesn’t anymore. I told him that’s called practicing discipline as long as I don’t yell or sound too harsh. He said it would make my life easier just to put everything away that isn’t safe in general. I think it makes things more inconvenient for me. But maybe he is right. Please lay it on me however it comes I can deal with criticism, thank you.",parenting

Drop sleep sack for 14 month old,"I am the mother to a very sweet 14 month old girl. She is a GREAT sleeper and has been for a long long time. I was kind of a freak about keeping her crib safe when she was a baby. No bumpers or blankets or pillows. She never slept in bed with us even accidentally. I even installed a ceiling fan in her room before she was born because I read an article that the air circulation drastically reduces the risk of SIDS. When it was time to get rid of the swaddle (because she learned to flip over in it) we switched to a sleep sack and now we put her down in pajamas with a sleep sack. 

Now that she’s a little older I’m thinking about getting rid of the sleep sack. She’s about to outgrow the one she has now and instead of buying a bigger one I was just going to get rid of it entirely. She has fleece footy pajamas that she can use for winter and we also have cotton footie pajamas but I’ve noticed she doesn’t sleep as well without a sack and I worry she’s cold. Also her room can get cold as she has a humidifier and a ceiling fan. Once we turn the heat on her room will get comfortable but it’s one of those things where when the heat is actually running it’s warm but once it clicks off it gets chilly again. That being said she’s always kind of leaned towards cold-natured and she’s not a particularly hefty kid. 

So my question is what should I do? Just put her down in footies and call it a day? Offer a blanket? I know the AAP says it’s OK now that she’s over a year old but it still makes me nervous and I also worry she will kick the blanket off of her and then wake up cold and pissed. Also what do I do for naps? Just lay her down in her clothes? Take her pants off and offer a blanket?

I realize I’m probably over thinking the whole thing but I just want to do the best thing for my kid and keep her comfortable. TIA",parenting

As an adult, it's such a huge loss to me. I feel like I lost touch with my culture. I want to reintroduce these holidays into our life but it's so hard to find time to celebrate with day to day life. How do you guys manage to find the balance? Any tips?",parenting
Newborns parents need help,"Hi!

We discussed lately with my partner further steps about take care of our son (2m). My partner would like to start to give him formula little by little, and prefer still breastfeed him until he will be at least 6mo, as WHO recommends ( [https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/](https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/) ). I think it might be because he would like to take care of our boy fully as I do. Here is my question: how to deal with this problem? Anyone has similar experience and can help?

Another problem is parental leave. We are lucky to live in the country, where it is 14 months. I wanted to share it equally with me starting and after my partner. However now he feels it is not fair, since i will bound stronger with baby... He would like to join me on parental leave in 5th month so we can take care of baby together. I would love to postpone kindergarten as late as it is possible. Any solutions?

As I said it is our first child and we are totally blue. I think it is better to stay with baby  and also to breastfeed him as long as possible. Maybe I am wrong? Your experience and also articles are appreciated.",parenting
Negative Body Interactions - Thoughts?,"My son in Kindergarten told me something surprising recently and I'm still processing it. He is in a Kinder and Gr1 split class. One day he mentioned to me that in the bathroom, another boy in his class put his mouth on his penis and his tongue in his mouth. I was shocked to hear that but don't know the best way forward. Is my son imagining it? Did he misunderstand or misrepresent the situation? If it did happen, it's hard to believe that the behaviour of the other boy is malicious or predatory at Gr.1. It would likely be curiosity. I don't want to villainize the other boy but I also want to protect my son. The thing is that my son did not have negative feelings towards the boy (so it seems) and he still played with him. We thought things were fine, just a momentary blip. But this event does seem to have occupied space in my son's psyche and memory. What to do? 

How many people do I bring this incident up? I don't plan to name the boy until we can all figure out who needs to know. Do I include just the principal or vice principal? Do I include the teacher? Also, if the boy does have inappropriate behaviour, it will be important to help him early on.

To all parents, it's important to talk to your children about these things and to probe for negative experiences to make sure they are safe.",parenting
Is my 2 week old sleeping too much?,"Hello everyone, 

we have been struggling to get our new baby back to his original weight and getting enough breast milk to actually nurse him good but over the weekend everthing finally clicked. He slept, he said when he wanted to get fed and he gained weight. Over the last 2 days though his weight stayed the same and today he lost 10g again. Over the whole day he is sleeping way more then usual and not drinking much when offered. Is this normal? Should we be more concerned?

"Cat being put down, need help with explaining to my 3YO...","To preface, my cat’s name is Misty, and she lives with my mom because my wife has severe allergies. This has been the case for about 6 years. My daughter is 3, and I take her over to my mom’s quite frequently. She loves Misty so much and is kind of her de facto pet since we don’t have any at home.

Well Misty is now 17 (I’ve had her since I was 11) and hasn’t gone potty or eaten in the last 3 days. Our vet says that it’s time... She is being put down tomorrow at 11:30. I’m devastated because Misty is the only pet I’ve really ever developed a special connection with, but I’m more concerned with how to break it to my daughter. Or if I even should in the first place.

My daughter is 3 as I said, and is very advanced when it comes to understanding social skills and things like this. We’ve had the death talk about plants, and she seemed to understand. But this is different. Or maybe I just feel like it’s different because I’ve got such an attachment to Misty. I don’t know.

I’m just struggling and could really use some advice. Tonight would be the last night I could take my daughter to see Misty. What would you all do to prep your LO? Or would you at all?",parenting
Need Advice on 5 Month Old Swaddling and Rolling Over,"My daughter turned 5 months old last week. We just moved her from her bassinet to her crib because she outgrew it and exceeded the weight limit. We have been trying to stop using our halo swaddle because she rolls over all the time, but when we leave her arms out she rubs her face and it wakes her up. So we have had to continue swaddling so everyone can get some sleep (my husband and I both work). I have been sleeping on the floor of her bedroom, and this morning I wake up and am watching her sleep and all of a sudden she rolls over in her swaddle. So obviously we are done with swaddling her with her arms in. I have no idea what to do now. We have tried wearing mitts, but she still wakes herself up with rubbing. Also, we have tried special soaps and lotions in case she was rubbing due to sensitivity, but nothing has worked. Her pediatrician recommended just using warm water on her head and that is what we have been doing for the past few weeks.  Her daycare provider and her pediatrician have said that her rubbing is just a phase that will pass. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",parenting
Carpooling with car seats,"How does this work?

Kid will be starting at a new school next year. He'll be 5, and likely still in a 5-point harness (or at the very least a high back booster). The school encourages carpooling, we live 20 minutes from the school and work full time, so carpooling is definitely a great idea.

We have 1 kid, so have smaller cars (hatchbacks/sedans). If we carpool with another family and there are 3 boosters and/or carseats involved, they won't fit in our car. 

How do other families do carpooling when boosters and car seats are involved?",parenting

My (11mo) son has NO CHILL.,"Since he has learned to crawl he will get into EVERYTHING. There are baby gates everywhere. He pulls them down. We are about to start bolting them to walls. I am a SAHM, and at my wits end. No baby toy in this house can distract him. A potato is normally a go to (for whatever reason it's the only thing he'll play with for more then a minute) He's learned to push things to get on furniture and tables. And if it shakes and makes a noise. It gets shook until something falls. 

I get down to play with him. Play with toys, play peak a boo, sometimes I put a sock on my head and he takes it off, that game tends to last awhile. But then hes off again to make trouble. He can't walk yet but the boy can climb. 

I don't know how to burn all this energy. Everytime I'm around someone else's baby they will sit and cuddle. Not my son, if you sit down with him on the couch he off to the races to try and grab anything previously out of reach. The only time he stops is the one nap he takes during the day. And putting him down for that nap I pretty much have to bear hug him to get him to stop moving. Then after a 5 to 10 minute fight he'll pass out. 

What can I do? Am I just gonna have to buckle down and push through until he has a better grasp of no? Is there some activity I can do to wear my little man out? At this point I feel so frustrated with him. I love him so dearly and he doesn't deserve a mom who gets upset as fast as I do.",parenting
She would have been 7 today,"Every year on my daughters birthday and the anniversary of her death, I talk about how she died.  Its painful and it hurts, but if our story can prevent another death it brings me a little peace.

Isabella was born today, 7 years ago.  I was 24 and she was my first child.  My pregnancy was easy and so was labor and delivery.  She was born healthy and perfect in every way.  We had 7 wonderful weeks with her before she died.

She was a terrible sleeper, she would sleep for 40 minutes at a time and be awake for two hours after day and night.  We didn't know about swaddle Sacks back then, and I didn't know about safe sleeping.

On her last day of life in was desperate for sleep, so my husband stayed up with her so I could sleep.  She was propped up on the couch with pillows and her homemade tinkerbell blanket made by my grandmother.  I woke up at 230am and thought I should go check on them, but I was so tired I fell back asleep.  I'll never forgive myself for that.

At 430am I woke up to my husband screaming he couldn't wake her up.  We called 911, we did CPR for what felt like forever until EMS arrived.  Revival attempts were unsuccessful, and we left the hospital without our precious daughter, to go home to our apartment full of her things with nothing to do but grieve.

My husband fell asleep watching TV sitting up.  He woke up at 430 laying down with his legs on her chest.  The weight was too much for her little body and she suffocated because she couldn't breath.

We have had two other beautiful children since and another little girl due any day.  All my girls have been born in October, a sign I believe from above from our tiny angel to make this month a little easier for me.

So to all you new parents who think it would never happen to you, get the monitors that detect breathing.  If your tired, put the baby in the the crib or bassinet.  Be neurotic and crazy and listen to your instinct.  I pray you never go through what we have, and you never have to bury your child.

Happy birthday Isabella, I wonder who youd be turning 7 today if we had known better.",parenting
"Baby won't stop spitting up, I've tried everything.","I'm currently exclusively breastfeeding, bottles only when I'm not around.  My son (8 weeks) spits up almost every time he eats, especially at night. I swear I have tried everything; holding him upright while feeding, burping then holding him upright for 30 minutes, taking him off mid-feed to burp then put him back on (which is hard because he'll fall asleep and won't latch back on sometimes), and every other trick I've seen or heard of. He wakes up at night cold, obviously, so I change him at least three times a night. Everytime he wakes up, he also wants to eat, as I assume he's hungry since he spit a bunch up or he just won't go back to sleep at all, he'll just stay awake (which means he's crying unless I'm rocking or walking around with him) until it is time to eat again.

Has anyone had success helping this by switching to formula? The lack of sleep is really starting to get to me so even though I don't want to switch to formula (I do enjoy breastfeeding), I'm willing to try anything at this point.",parenting
7 year old bathroom habits,"So I have a 7 year old boy, and hes always been an early riser. Back in November, we had to move back in with my mother. My mom gets up at 4:30 every morning to get a bath. As I said, hes always an early riser but it used to be about 6AM where as now its normally about 5. 

Every single morning, like clockwork, hes up and trying to go in the bathroom constantly. 4 or 5 times in the morning, he ends up waking me up and Ill tell him to get back in bed, and he ALWAYS whines about it, gets back into bed, and literally within 5 minutes trying to use the bathroom as an excuse to stay out of bed. 

Ive run out of patience Reddit. I dont sleep well as it is and this is cutting my 6 hours of sleep down to 3.5 or 4 a night. Its been like this for months now. Im losing my sanity with this boy and its a constant argument with him over when hes allowed to get out of bed for the day. Ive tries everything I can think of, and no matter what we take away or how long hes stuck in his room, nothing fucking works.

4 Month Old Sleep: The Depths of Despair,"Short but sweet here! 
My four month old daughter does not have a consistent sleep schedule, and wakes during the night multiple times and cannot self soothe. I am so sleep deprived and frustrated with the crying and whining, I am seriously wishing that I could win the lottery and have 24 hour a day help. I’ve dreamt about it. Twice. 
This is my first and last child... I initially thought I wanted two, but I can’t do this again. No, I won’t change my mind.
She is starting daycare in two weeks, and the daycare promised to help establish a firm schedule (for $2,000 per month, they had better). I also retained a sleep consultant, we are beginning 10/20.
Until then, can anyone please provide a short list of proven sleep solutions?
The main issue is: wakes twice during the middle of the night, is starving. Eats a little, then will NOT go back to sleep. Sometimes she falls asleep in our arms, but once placed back into the crib (we bend all the way and hold her tight to our chest while placing her), she immediately flails and starts whining. Rinse and repeat for about 3 hours.
It is pitch black in her room, correct temperature, sound machine (you get the idea). I’ve tried a “wedge” to prop her up because she likes the car seat. She also likes walking, but I refuse to start putting her in the stroller at 3:00am and taking a stroll around the block in the NYC winter.
She is fed before bed if she wants it, and usually takes it.
She is a tall baby, about 27” and 17 pounds.
I’ve tried every single swaddle (magic Merlin, love to dream, halo), nothing helps.
Bedtime routine as follows: bath, stories, bed.
I feel like I’ve tried EVERYTHING. I know she won’t go to college like this... but maybe she will.

How much does school districts matter?,"We have a very privileged problem. We currently live in a rich school district. It’s over 90% white and less than 1% are on lunch assistance (7 kids in the whole district). We didn’t plan it this way. We just happen to find a great deal on a short sale here. Now my kids are close to school age. My husband and I are two different minorities and grew up poor. 

The actual elementary school we’re assigned to isn’t rated very well even though the district / suburb is one of the top in the state. We’re thinking of moving to a nearby larger district that has more socio-economic and racial diversity which also has a few better elementary schools (though also a lot of worse ones as well which drag the whole district down). It’s also closer to work and has full day kindergarten which works better with our schedules. Are we crazy helicopter parents? Is it all just a crap shoot anyway?

A couple things I will mention: we’ve spoken to people who were minorities who grew up in mostly rich, white schools who said it really messed with their self esteem because they got bullied. My husband and I also ended up in richer schools by high school. My husband was shocked by the connections people had. I was surprised by how nice, but very entitled the kids were. Neither of us got bullied, but did see it with other people. We want to keep our kids grounded and kind which is our main concern. They might get more connections at our current school, but I think they’ll be happier, more empathetic people if they had more realistic life expectations and understood that everyone is worthwhile and not everyone has it easy.",parenting
11yo twins with mental health issues,"And they said it would get better...

I have a son with ADHD who breaks down and shuts down during classes. He has an IEP, so he's in smaller groups in English, but now it's happening in social studies too... We're going to put him back on his mood stabilizer meds, and start therapy again... We've been struggling with this for years. ADHD meds make his emotional issues worse...

Then my daughter. Adorable with people that she doesn't know well, but has epic tantrums at home. Like, refusing to take a shower and hiding under the table until we ""make her"". Huge meltdowns over homework. Getting mad if she doesn't get her way. Every single time. Then she's awesome for an hour, and out of nowhere something bothers her and it starts again.

Rewards, consequences, nothing works with them. My daughter was in therapy a year ago and we stopped because all the therapist could recommend was rewards. Now we're trying another one...

They're adopted, who knows what their birthparents' mental health was like, but their biological brother (also adopted) is very strong willed as well.

We're emotionally drained. Sometimes we get a good day and then something triggers my daughter and it's ruined. My son is doing badly in school because he's always overwhelmed. I see all my friends with ""normal"" kids and I feel depressed.

Help us discipline our possibly adhd/spd/anxious son?,"How would you handle this?

Our son has gone off the rails.  He started kindergarten a month ago and got dismissed from the school (private) because of violent behavior towards teachers.  That violent behavior is now present at home.  We don’t know where to put him in school because we worry he will just be kicked out again.  Also, our local public schools are notoriously bad.

We also had a baby four days ago.

Our kid is not fully neurotypical but we are still working on figuring out exactly what.  Pediatrician thinks adhd and anxiety and we started adderall a month ago, which seems to help him pretty obviously.  But the anxiety piece is still clearly there.  He also has dyspraxia, a motor coordination disorder.  Caregivers have been flagging him as different since he was a toddler.

Right now his behavior is insane.  He refuses to do things, then runs his mouth, throws things or is violent if he doesn’t get what he wants.  He will rage in his room while in time out for literally an hour.  He worries about everything - will not walk down to the playground because he is worried about getting run over.  Worries something bad will happen to his stuffed animals.

My wife and my mom think we should go scorched earth with this type of plan:

1) “school at home” (while we look for another school for him): all toys and books disappear each night, he gets them back upon completion of the school day we design for him (say, 3-4 hours of school).

2) no tolerance to violence: violent or threatening behavior loses all books and toys, literally all, until the next day.

3) continue with 123 magic regardless of punishment status - instant time outs for violence / threats.

I am worried about this plan because it is so absolute - once he receives the punishment there’s no incentive to behave for the rest of the day.  It also requires us to put up with him for the rest of the day when punished: with the new baby here as well.

I am also worried because we don’t know how much of this behavior is related to neuro / psych issues and how much is him playing us like fools.

We are so stressed and tired.  Any insight or similar situations would be incredibly helpful.",parenting
Boys at school (4 years) not playing with son (3 years),"My son turned 3 in August.  In September, he started a new preschool with 3 year olds and 4 year olds

A study on how I ruined my 14 mo’s life,"My daughter is an amazing eater. She eats pretty much anything, anytime. She loves oranges and tomatoes and apples the most. I’ve never had to encourage her to eat anything or try anything new. She just loves to eat. 

She’s also a decent sleeper and never takes more than an hour to get down and that’s a rare, bad day. Don’t get me wrong, we still have our sleep challenges like waking up in the middle of the night and taking a couple of hours to go back down, but the initial laying down is usually pretty smooth. 

So tonight we took her to a buffet so she could have many different things. She loves this. The last thing I get her is a plate with some cantaloupe, lychee, a jello cube, and an orange slice. She loves oranges and doesn’t want help eating so I was trying to be hands off but she kept eating the peel and so I thought I would peel the slice for her. 

I. Ruined. Her. Whole. Life. 

She got very upset and cried and wouldn’t touch it. She didn’t want any of her other food. She didn’t want a new orange slice. She didn’t want to be held by me. She didn’t want a cookie for the ride home. She cried so much. 

When we got home she fought her bath, which she loves, she fought her jammies, which is normal. I offered her a banana. No. An apple. No. Leftover lasagna, a favorite. Nope. 

We play baby shark and try to play with her. It’s a complete no go and makes her cry harder. So we read her a story through her tears and laid her down. She wouldn’t stop crying. I suspect at this point that she is pretty hungry. I offer her apple sauce pouches (strawberry and the coveted cinnamon), I offered her graham crackers, fruit snacks, gold fish, I cut a tomato, I cut an apple, I sent daddy out for strawberries, I offered her a clementine (peeled, what can I say), yogurt, popcorn, everything in the house she could have. It was all a no.

I tried Tylenol, she has almost all of her baby teeth and is only missing 6, 4 of which are 2nd molars that are trying to poke through. She still cried. I took her temp, inspected for diaper rash and just generally started to panic because she has never cried like this before. Daddy is doing bicycles even though she farts on her own like a grown man. 

Finally, while I’m rocking her, I take a sip of water and she wants it. She drinks some water. Good start. We are 4 hours into bedtime and 6 hours past the orange incident at this point. So I have daddy bring me a cheese stick. And I eat it. And she asks for some. So I give her some and we get her another for herself. She asks for more. There are no more cheese sticks but I start offering more of her favorites. She accepts a banana. Then she wants another one. Ok. After the second banana she wants a third. We are out of bananas, besides I’m not willing to send my spiraling life down the course of giving an angry constipated toddler her first enema. I offer an apple. Nope. 

Mom has once again ruined her life. She cries. I cry. We try everything again. Nothing. She’s sniveling in my arms as I rock her and daddy brings offerings of peace to the goddess of no sleep. Two more hours pass and she finally passes out in my arms. I laid her down and she didn’t wake up, very unusual but I’m not complaining.

3yr Old being bullied,"Today I took my daughter to school. She always asks me if she can go to school and loves her school. When she is ill, we stay at home with her and those are the only times that she does not want to go to school. 

Today she said she wanted to go home and not go to school. She is perfectly fine and saw something was up. I asked her if anyone was hurting her, and she said yes and then said no. I knew something was wrong, so after I dropped her off at school, I send a msg to her teacher to find out if she is okey at school, if she might be bullied at school. 

I hoped it was all in my head, but her teacher confirmed it after talking to my daughter and having more success with her. The teacher, so grateful for her, took the problem child to the head teacher and reprimanded the child.

How to stop wet nights?,"My little one (4F) keeps on wetting her bed at night. TL;DR at the end.

Me and my wife are running out of ideas to make her stay dry for a whole night (during day time, while she is awake she has no problem for more than a year now). By the end of the summer she was still using nappies and we noticed that some mornings they were dry, and when not, it seemed she was just peeing in the morning when she just awake and was lazy to move.

So we thought it was time. We have tried rewarding her if she stays dry, but only worked like 2 days. We tried taking her to the toilet in the middle of the night but that has led to peeing like 3 times during the whole night, and therefore making things worst in my opinion.

His spitting up got so bad that we got the okay from the doctor to start giving him oatmeal in his formula. That helped for a while but now we are giving him water and purées which have him spitting up significant quantities 4-10x after most feedings. 

Has anyone else had this issue? Did anything help? When will I stop having to change outfits 3x a day?

Four year old requires us to stay in room at bedtime?,"Hey, So I sort of just want to know if this is normal. Our four year old, who we have split custody of, is unable to sleep without us in the room. She wakes up 2-3 times a night and will scream and cry herself hysterical if we dont sit in the room with her while she goes to sleep. Some nights she will fight sleep until we end up falling asleep in her bed. 

Is this normal? How can we fix this?",parenting
Strong-willed child with little empathy,"I don’t even know where to begin. My child is 11/F. Her dad and I are divorced and both remarried. Until she was 5, she was the only child. Now she has a nice blended family on both sides who adore her. We are blessed with how many people actually care for her. My husband and I, her dad and her stepmom all get along and have a group text about said child. 

She started at 2 with terrible temper tantrums where her dad would physically have to hold her in his lap with his arms around her to keep her from destroying her surroundings. It has gradually escalated. 

It’s like she has 2 personalities. She’s one way at her dads house, and one way at my house. She has been physical with her step-siblings, as in stomping their necks, hitting, kicking, etc. She can turn on the charm and be an angel when she gets her way. Then when things don’t go her way, it’s on like donkey kong. 

I wish I could explain this better. She’s the most hateful child I’ve ever seen. Nothing is good enough. She has grandparents who see her as a victim of divorce and worship the ground she walks on. They enable this behavior. They seem obsessed to a very unhealthy degree with her. She’s very manipulative. She made my husband out to be abusive and a monster. She was taken from me for about 5 months until her dad and stepmom realized it was an act. She woke up one morning and it was like “ok I’m done with this chapter I’m ready to go back over there and stay”. It was crazy what all we had to go through because of what she made up. 

Another example of the 2 personalities: she has a dance class that is paid up for a year. Over at her dads she says she loves it. At my house, she complains about it and acts like she hates it. 

We took her on a family trip and she nearly ruined it with pouting because of us wanting family pictures. She begged to go on this trip and this 5 minute ordeal set her off. 

Her stepmother doesn’t trust her when she’s not there. She won’t stand up to her stepmom, but will take it out on the younger step sibling. She’ll talk so ugly to her until she cries, then flip her hair, smile, and walk off. 

Tonight she was told to brush her teeth and she stomped off and pouted. I told her I was taking away her iPad and phone and she simply said, “ok”. I currently have a list of chores that she is to do in the morning with a cheerful attitude. 

She is my only biological child and I love her so much and my heart is breaking. I want her to see a psychologist to get to the root of this issue but her dad won’t have it. He took away all of my rights with the courts when she pulled that little stunt of accusing my husband of being a monster. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. That an 11 year old child can wreak this much havoc on families and accuse with no proof. Nothing happened and now they see it, but my rights were still taken in a fast decision moment by her dad. That’s a whole other topic I won’t get into. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? Like I said, her dad has prevented me from getting her to a psychologist. Her stepmother is even wanting her to see one. He won’t have it. I don’t know what to do. My heart is shattered. 

Sorry if this is all over the place. My mind is overwhelmed and I’m worried and scared for her.",parenting
Son Cries at Soccer,"Hello fellow parents. I'm in need of advice, ideas, something...

My son (7) cries at every soccer event. Games, practice, even a soccer birthday party. He's upset that he's not getting goals. It's not a pressure I feel like I put on him, I try to encourage him to be a good teammate. I tell him that guarding players, defending goals, passing the ball, and cheering your teammates of just as important. I really feel for him, but he just doesn't improve. He gives up once someone else tries to take the ball. I've tried bribing him in the past, but he gets in this mode where he just doesn't care. Same with punishment. It's hard because I know he could do better if he just tried, and it's a little embarrassing that his teammates are having their fun interrupted by his whining/cry/tantrum.

I'm just not sure what to do. I was never a kid who did team sports, and he doesn't want to do Kung Fu with me. What have you experienced with team sports and, if you had similar issues, how did you get through it?",parenting
10 month old behavior improvements!,"Hi all! 

I have an almost 10 month old baby boy. He’s a good boy most of the time but for the last week he has been hitting. He thinks it’s funny to smack our chest or faces and his dad thinks it’s just as hilarious as our son. I can be holding him in my lap facing and then BAM! Hard hit to the face followed by uncontrollable giggling from him. Nobody has taught him this either. 

He also has been screaming. Loudly..For no reason. Not crying. Just screaming and laughing. 

Lastly, he still wakes up 3 times to eat.  And chokes on little bitty food pieces I give him like eggs, rice, or puffs or yogurt bits. He has 2 bottom teeth and he has 3 top ones all coming in at the same time. I’m trying to get him to eat more through the day and sleep at night. 

Doctor said he is meeting all his milestones, he’s about to walk, and his heights and weight are good. 

Any advice for this tired mama? I wouldn’t say they are issues but would like to improve them.

Ear infections in 3 1/2 year old,"So our daughter keeps getting new bugs after starting part time childcare and as well as this she’s now developed reoccurring ear infections, today I hear her say “mummy my ears hurt again” :(:(:( she’s had amoxicillin and now the pink one (forgot the name) and we just finished that and now her ears hurt again just a week after finishing her last lot... her ears still haven’t drained properly and she asks us to repeat ourselves often. We hate the idea of surgery as we feel it’s all because she’s just started school, it is winter/autumn where we live now so what do people think keep trying the antibiotics till summer... then see how she goes over the summer, her Dr said it would help a lot if she doesn’t pick up any new viruses because then it might give her ears a chance to heal in between infections... About to see her Dr again tomorrow and he’s probably going to refer us to an ENT specialist. Some background too is that her skin reacts to random things like sunscreen or some clothing labels, washing powders etc she gets a red itchy rash then she gets hay fever like symptoms and I feel this could be a part of the problem but maybe not. I’ve had her blood tested and the only allergy is latex. (Haven’t done the patch tests yet, should we?). I’ve had to stop her swimming lessons even though the infections are in her inner ear (not like swimmers ear). I am having to give her children’s Pamol when she’s in pain.

Help with sleep training fidgety toddler,"I have posted before in this subreddit about sleep training the toddler. Got a few comments. But, we couldn't do the sleep training due to some illness.

We are finally at a place where rocking also does not work. I have been trying to just put him on his bed and let him sleep for the last 5 days. Even when I take him to his bed at the right time, he makes it very hard. He is extremely fidgety and won't stay in one place. Keeps kicking, or hitting the wall or the pillow. It takes as long as 1 hour with patience wearing out every minute. Even when he is awake, he is hyper active. He won't even sit on our laps for more than 10 seconds. Spouse is not ok with just leaving the kid in the room and closing the door. In any case, he keeps coming out even if we do that. Or worse might get hurt because he keeps running around in the room. So, I stay in the room and put him back on his bed as much as I can. What else can we do to make it easy on all of us? Feel like we are failing at this parenting thing.",parenting
Need help picking my battle.,"I could really use some advice. So, I started working full time again and my baby (about 1 year) has started staying with my mother during the day. I am so grateful because I am saving so much in daycare. I pay her a relatively small amount just because I know she could use it and I want to show her that I appreciate her giving up every day of the week to babysit. I had been sending breakfast and lunch with him because I want him to try new things and eat healthy. She was good at first about feeding it to him, but then she began saying she didn't give it to him because he just ate some of what she had. And now it's to the point where she sends back home his lunch every day and it just goes to waste. (Whatever I can't save.) One of the main reasons I really don't want him to just eat her food is because all my life ever since I was a child eating habits in our household were extremely poor. She is very overweight and I know likely feeds him sugary cereal each morning and pizza or chicken nuggets for lunch. I don't want to confront her about this because I know it would hurt her feelings. And I don't want to start a fight because (beyond just not wanting to fight with my mother), I don't want to lose this good option I have instead of daycare, and I keep questioning is it even worth it. Even if I did confront her, how could I even say it in a nice way? ""Sorry Mom, please don't hate me, but please stop feeding my baby junk food because I don't want him to turn out fat like I was because of you."" I'm so frustrated, but I just wonder if I should just accept that this is the price for this daycare setup, and suck it up or what.",parenting

My children's[7M/9M] step sister [7F] is starting to realize what a different life they are living compared to her. What can I do to minimize this?,"Here's some background... My children's dad and I are divorced and we are remarried. His wife has a daughter, who has been my children's step sister for the last 4-5 years (they call her their sister). She used to spend some time at her Dad's, but custody changed and she's with her mom and my ex 100% now. 

Due to the time they need to start work, my ex has started dropping off all 3 kids at my house every day and I drive them to school. We have a decent enough relationship and I'm fine with this arrangement. I'm thrilled I get to see my kids every day!

My husband and I started off with similar household incomes as my ex and his wife, but have finished graduate school and in the next couple years will be at very different socioeconomic levels. What this means is we are able to provide more opportunities/after school activities/etc for the boys. We are also living in a nice condo complex in a great neighborhood (will be moving into a house soon) while they are living in a not so great neighborhood in a mobile home park. I'm not implying there's anything wrong with this, but their daughter is starting to realize the difference and is becoming upset about it. She wonders why the boys are in sports and she is not, why they can do after school enrichment clubs and she is not. Her parents either cannot afford to and/or don't care to put in the effort to sign her up (not trying to get into that aspect here).

I think coming to my house every morning has made her realize this other life her brothers get that she doesn't. The disparity will only increase as time goes on. I've told my boys not to brag to her about what activities they do as to not hurt her feelings. I'm not sure what else to do. What can I do to deal with the situation? Is there anyone in a similar situation with children living 50/50 in very different households? Advice is appreciated!! 

TLDR: my kids are living in households at different socioeconomic levels and their step-sister at my ex's house is starting to realize this and become upset at the unfairness. How can I help my kids deal with this difference in households as they get older and help minimize the impact on their step-sister??",parenting

"Dinner, Bath &amp; Bed routine","Hi all!

Recently the wife and I have been pretty exhausted, because the dinner bath and bed routine with our 16 month old is getting to be less manageable as he gets older. 

Currently, we make dinner, sit with him at the table while we all eat dinner at 6, then my wife does bath time, while I clean up dinner and wash dishes etc.  then we both go to his room, read a book with him and pop him in bed. he’s usually asleep by 7:30 and sleeps all night, but there’s still his toys to clean up, washing to finish, and I may not have the kitchen clean by then. By the time we get to eventually sit down, it’s 9pm and it’s usually straight to bed 😂

We’re not messy people, and our house is tidy, doing chores whenever we have spare time, but after work is really the only “family time” we get together. 

What’s your routine? How do you make it quicker?

Parent Association Drama - Book Fair,"So I volunteered to chair the book fair this year at my DD's school. No one really has taken ownership of it the last 2 times and they were pretty mediocre.  I used to love those damn scholastic fairs so much and when I saw my daughter attend her first one and the look of awe on her face, I knew I had hit on a great way to contribute to her school.  

 Anyhow today was Day 1, and the PAC president (PP) was laying into me about certain things.  I had literally 2 weeks to get it organised and had to work closely with our Scholastic rep to fill in all the holes in my knowledge.  The school had kept no records of past fairs.  The PP controlled all the emails and volunteer records - I couldnt even email or call volunteers to coordinate their efforts.  Additionally the schools account was sitting on a huge unredeemed rewards balance that the librarian had no idea about.  It has been very frustrating to say the least, and today when she was laying into me about missing contests, rewards redemption etc, I kind of gave it back to her about not adequately sharing info until 2 weeks before event and then only limited stuff.  Things definitely ended with coldness and an impasse. 

I am not going to lie, it was discouraging to have my efforts put down. On the other hand, I want to do what's best for our kids education so I am not gonna let PP's power trip keep me down.   What do you think is best way to address this with PP?",parenting

My 4 year old son is developing an unhealthy friendship,"My 4 year old is a very sweet boy. He found himself a best friend in pre-school a year and half ago and the two have been inseparable since then. But, unfortunately, my child is making his own life uncomfortable at the hands of his best friend. The other kid while sweet on many occasions, is also exhibiting an unmistakable mean streak and more often than not, it's my child that's at the receiving end. It upsets him to no end that his ""best friend"" is being mean; he follows him around crying and demands an apology. I suspect that my child's desperation is giving this other kid some kind of a power trip because not only does he refuse to apologize, he justifies his bad behavior. 

The aggravating thing is that my child gets into this type of situation with only this ""best friend"". He is pretty assertive with all his other friends. I don't want my child to internalize that abuse comes along for the ride in special relationships. I have been teaching him that best friends are never mean. I'm not sure it has registered to him. It almost seems like he'd rather have the comfort of friendship than confront his friend about his horrible behavior.

Because these two kids picked out each other as best friends, as parents, me and wife have become good friends with the other kid's parents. They are really good people and they do their best to discipline the rouge kid, but his bad behavior persists. For instance, yesterday, my wife was baby-sitting these two kids and they got into an accident during play time; my child tried to reach for a toy his friend was holding, and his friend refused to hand it to him and swung the toy away and ended up hitting my kid on his face. My child got a scratch below his eye and it started to bleed slightly, but more importantly to him, his friend didn't apologize and it made him all the more miserable :( I heard the crying and ran inside to see my wife comforting my child and asking his best friend to apologize to put the matter to rest. My jaw dropped when this other kid said he didn't mean it and that my child grabbed the toy and hence he didn't have to  apologize. 

My first instinct was to call this other kid's parents and ask them to come get their kid right away, but once I calmed down I decided against it because I didn't want to lose their friendship. I also haven't yet thought about the best way to approach this topic with them.

How have you folks approached such situations in the past? What worked and what did not? Thanks for your time.",parenting
My Kid Won't Participate,"My son is almost 4. We signed him up to play soccer in the summer and he seemed to enjoy it.  (That is, he participated at practice and he tried at the ""training"" sessions.)

We asked if he wanted to play this fall, and he said yes so we signed him up again. It's like night and day - he cries, whines, and basically will just stand there. Literally no amount of bribary, begging, or asking what's wrong will budge him. He stubbornly only does it when he wants. Which is frustrating for us bc he says he wants to play then he does not once we actually get to the field. 

I understand he's almost 4 but every other child on the team participates except mine. (All of the kids are about the same age, none of them knew each other prior to this season.)  I don't know what to do. Is it ""lol he's 4"" or is it ""he's got an issue"" - I'm so at a loss.

My son (black) says that he doesn't like being around black people. What do we do?,"My husband and I are foster and adoptive parents. We have a 6 year old son and 4 year old daughter that were adopted from foster care. They are biological siblings and both black. Our foster son (2.5) that we will likely adopt is mixed race of Black and white heritage. 

We are part of transracial adoption groups and most transrace adoptees stress the important of racial mirrors, which essentially means to make sure our kids spend time around other black people. I grew up non religious but my husband grew up Mormon. He left the church after coming out and we don't raise our kids in religion but do take them to a black church for special events. For example, we will take them for the fall fesitval and take them to kids' days they host. We also take the boys to a black owned barbershop. They go to a diverse school and have black classmates. 

I was talking about the fall fest with my son over the weekend and he asked if he had to go. I asked him why he didn't want to go and he said because there are too many black people there. It caught me by surprised and asked why that would be a problem. He said, ""I just don't like being around black people that much."" I wasn't really sure where to go from there but told him I wouldn't make him go but that he shouldn't dislike being around black people. He said he just doesn't like it and it makes him feel scared and bad.

Advice for how to relax when kids are always at home?,"Father to a four and one year old.

Lately I have been thinking about how hard it is for me to relax, and I think I have processed out that a lot of what I used to do befe kids to relax was house projects and/or unstructured time around the house, which have all but disappeared since having kids.

Weekends are filled with family time, but even when my wife is managing the kids they take up the whole space. After bed time is a nice time, but then I have to be quiet and I only have the energy to stay up 90-120 minutes after they're asleep.

The other day work was quiet, so my boss encouraged me to work from home, but I spent whole the day bouncing between coffee shops and the library knowing that at home the kids are going to be all up in my business.

I would like to take a day or two off from work for a little staycation to recharge my batteries, but I am not sure what I would do, as the kids are at home nearly all the time.

I don’t know how or when to talk with my daughter about why we don’t live with her dad or do things together with him.,"My daughter is almost four years old and I have been divorced from her dad for almost a year now. We live in different parts of the same state, several hours away. Visitation with him is done via “exchange” at airports. She speaks with him at least once or twice a week via Skype, but I hold the phone for her otherwise she thinks it’s funny to hang up or mess around on the screen, so I am there for the entire conversation between her and her father. 

A few nights ago, her father tells her he misses her and can’t wait to see her again soon. She says she misses him too and asks if “Mommy can come too.” He hesitates and says no, then is at a loss for words. I tell her that’s a special time for just him and her to be together and do things together. She then cuddles into me, looks at the phone screen and sadly says “I just wish we were a family again.” Then she started to sniffle. Her father didn’t say anything and turned red in the face (probably out of embarrassment of not knowing how to respond), and all I could think of doing was hugging her with my free arm and kissing her head. 

My ex changed the subject, but I couldn’t get rid of the echo of what my daughter said and the realization of how perceptive she is. Typically when she asks why I can’t go with her to see her dad, I tell her that’s her special time with him. I tell her I love her very much and that her father loves her too, as well as how she has many people in her life that love and care for her deeply. 

How do I handle situations like this where she says something like that? I felt bad not saying anything in that moment, but I didn’t know what to say. I have thought about (many times) the future where if she asks why we aren’t together anymore to say “some people just don’t work out together”, until I believe she’s old enough to know the real truth behind our divorce, if she ever asks what happened. 


Is there anything I should say? She’s such a social and happy child, but moments like that break my heart for her. I want her to feel like she is a family with me, and to absolutely know that she is loved. Her saying that made me think she doesn’t see just a mom and a daughter as a family due to seeing other couples in public or with friends having kids as a nuclear family.",parenting
7th grader was punched in the face and lied about the cause of the injury.

Question About Daycare vs Stay Home Involving Toddler and Newborn.,"I have a 2 year old son, who will be exactly 2.5 years old when his little brother is born. I will be taking maternity leave for 12 months. 

I'm having a hard time deciding whether to keep my older son home with us or whethet to keep him going to daycare at maybe 2 days a week. Here is my pro and con lists so far:

PRO Daycare:

- We have no family or friends in our city, so after my husband goes back to work, it'll just be me and the two kids alone. I won't be able to give either kid the attention they are used to/deserves.

- My oldest son is ACTIVE. I've had days at home with him (I work part time in office and part time from home) where I've tried to keep him home while I finished up chores, he usually only makes it to noon before he's bouncing off the walls and we have to go to a park. I don't use screens to entertain him as I've learned the hard way that even just half an hour of Blippi or even Khan Academy Kids will give him the ""post video game adrenaline rush"", so I don't use screens for him at all now. 

- My son enjoys going to daycare. He has friends there. It's also become his routine and he's learning better there because it's a group environment. 

AGAINST Daycare:

- The biggest concern is obviously him catching bugs and bringing them home to the newborn. We're a very cuddly family overall so I do expect that we won't be able to avoid newborn getting sick somehow by either direct contact with his brother or contact with me/dad after we've had contact with older son. My older son literally did not get sick until he went into daycare at 8 months. By then he was old enough for it to not be so miserable on him or on us. 

- Despite him enjoying daycare, if anybody asked my son whether he wants to go to ""school"" or hang out with mum all day, he still chooses mum. Mini Pro Daycare: But I suspect that might change once he realises that mum can no longer do fun stuff with him all day (we literally play all day when I get a whole day with him now). His newborn brother is gonna have me strapped to a nursing chair every couple of hours, so our adventure times are pretty much over for a while until baby brother can crawl/walk. 

- We do have the option to have a ""mum's helper"" (a baby sitter that comes by for a couple of hours to help me out while we're at home) come a couple of days a week. This person can probably take my older one out to the park for an afternoon here and there. Mini Pro Daycare argument: Daycare costs are still subsidized here even when I'm on mat leave, so I'd be paying less costs in daycare to have my son there for whole days while in-home care is not subsidized, meaning the mum's helper who would only be here for half days a couple days a week would end up costing more than (2x the amount) whole day daycare for the same amount of days a week. 

Over all I feel selfish for leaning towards keeping son in daycare, as it looks like I'm just trying to make things easier for myself. My oldest not getting to play outside as much as he's used to though (even at 7 months pregnant now, I take him outside to the beach or the park at least once a day and sometimes twice a day) is a huge concern of mine. And him losing that social interaction at daycare is a concern as well. When we go to parks he's usually so happy if there are other toddlers there to play with. 

And a question I have for parents with multiple children who've had to make this choice before: what did you end up doing? If you kept the older in daycare, did your newborn get sick all the time? If you kept the older home, what did you do to entertain them while still nursing the newborn?

Thanks for any advice or information!",parenting

6 y/o son stealing gum and being dishonest at school,"Got a call from his 1st grade teacher today that my son has been signing out to use the bathroom and going off to different areas and he's been stealing gum from the special ed room and from his teachers desk.

My oldest is a good kid who knows right from wrong, but he sometimes can't stop himself. He's snuck gum from our cars before when he knows he's not supposed to. I'm not sure if we've gone too easy on him in the past, but we've had lots of talks about trust, stealing, being manipulative and being sneaky. 

I'm not sure how exactly to get him to listen and understand. Or more accurately, how to get him to control himself. He's always been impulsive and emotional, and doesn't seem to think about the consequences before doing things he's not supposed to. I just *really* want to nip this behavior in the bud before he get's older. 

Clearly the conversations we've had with him aren't doing a lick of good, so we're going to try grounding him for the week. I'm not sure what else can help him understand and control himself.",parenting
It sounds bad when you say it like that...,"My five year old daughter, walking up to me out of nowhere and looking me very seriously in the eye: ""Mommy, you can't swallow, okay?""

Me: *internal screaming* ""Okay...""

My daughter, still being Very Serious: "" You have teeth, you have to use them. You can't swallow. It's the law.""

Me, wondering who my daughter has been talking to: ""...right.""

My daughter, slightly threateningly: ""Don't swallow, mommy.""

Then she wanders off to play.

Turns out she had been listening to the song ""The Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly"" and came to the conclusion the whole tragedy could have been prevented if the old lady had chewed her food instead of swallowing everything whole.

"How would you feel about ""aqueous martinis"" at a kids party?","For those who haven't seen the brilliant Netflix series based on Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, there are a couple characters who drink ""aqueous martinis"", which are just water in a martini glass with an olive. It's a joke about pretentious wealthy hipsters.

It occurred to me that aqueous martinis might be kinda fun at a fancy dress up birthday party for a kid, maybe 6-8 years old? My kids are much younger than that, but the thought crossed my mind that it could be a fun theme for a party: everyone comes dressed to the nines, and you serve kid-friendly versions of fancy foods, and aqueous martinis could be a natural beverage pairing.

But it occurs to me that some people might view that as promoting drinking? If your kid got invited to a party like that, would you find it inappropriate?",parenting
Four year old written up for insubordination. Did the preschool handle this appropriately?,"My four year old son was written up for insubordination at his preschool. The complaint from the teacher is that he often refuses directions in favor of doing his own activities. The directions he refuses are things like coming to sit at story time, at the craft table, and so on. He’d rather continue playing with his blocks or at worst, pouts with his arms crossed in the corner or drops to the floor and just lays there. He is not the best with expressing himself verbally.  He’s not hyperactive or violent, he just wants to do his own thing. 

I get this can be frustrating and it’s not uncommon behavior for him. We’re struggling with his stubbornness at home right now, too, on top of him waking up several time a night since school started last month, so he’s also exhausted and extra cantankerous. He doesn’t like doing crafts or sitting during group storytime. He’s a picky eater and often refuses the snack. I get there are rules and routine, but I feel I pay the preschool to help me teach him the rules and routine, no matter how frustrating he can get, without the threat of a write up (they’re suspended after three write ups, kicked out after four) for a four year old laying on the floor and refusing to do the craft.

Last year when he was in the 3s class he had the same teacher. During the Christmas performance he refused to put on the hat and tried to hide behind his teacher because he was shy and nervous. The teacher got very frustrated with him and yelled loudly and angrily during the performance “(his name), go sit with mom!” I don’t take the attitude that my kid is a perfect angel. I have always been very receptive and open to any concerns over his behavior, but that incident was the first time my mom spidey sense tingled that something isn’t right about the whole situation.

Today as I was walking into pick up, one of the assistant teachers, who has been very nice to me in the past, was very short with me, treating me noticeably different than she has in the past and as she did the other parents she was interacting with today. i knew something was up at that point. It left a very bad taste in my mouth because if she felt it was appropriate to be that cold and short with me, how does she treat my son?

As soon as the lead teacher saw me she immediately launched into a tirade (in front of all the other parents) about how he has been written up for laying on the floor today and refusing to participate. She was very hyper, I almost felt like she was barking at me. I told her I would talk with him about his behavior. 

I got into the car, but I began to mull over what just happened. I walked back in and requested a meeting with the teacher.

How would you handle this meeting? Does it sound like the teachers were out of line? I want my son to feel loved and wanted, even when he’s being difficult. He is only four. I want to feel confident that my son is loved and wanted at his school. Advice appreciated.",parenting
Struggles with ODD at school.,"I’ve written about my son and his behavioral issues in the past, but I believe that was before he was diagnosed with ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder). A little background: my husband is in the Army, and we just moved cross-country with a new baby to a state that we all absolutely detest. When we got here in February, we tried to put Son (6) in kindergarten. He was in class for two weeks before they were asking us to come get him. They even asked us to keep him home during an active shooter drill because they didn’t want to deal with this defiance during the drill. At that point I decided to homeschool the rest of the year and have him restart kindy in the Fall. We got him in therapy and he seems to have made a lot of progress, but we’re having issues with school again. He is getting a lot of one on one help from a special ed teacher at the school, but it struggling with social skills. There’s one particular boy who is also repeating kindy for behavioral issues stemming from being on the spectrum. During the first week, Son and Friend were inseparable. Now there’s intense rivalry over friends and the attention of the special ed teacher. Friend will tell Son “you’re my best friend. Ha! Tricked you! You’re not my friend” and then stop any other student from talking to Son. Son feels embarrassed and left out and has been reacting with physical violence...he’s punched, kicked, and scratched Friend on many occasions. At six years old, and at about two months into the school year, my kindergartner has been suspended TWICE as a result of physical violence. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I want to go crazy on the teachers for allowing this subtle bullying from Friend to continue unpunished. I want to pack my kids up and move back across the country to be closer to family in order to have a more stable support group (husband is a drill sergeant and may as well be deployed for all we see of him). We’ve even considered moving onto the Army post and having Son start school there where he’s surrounded by people who might have a little more sympathy for an overly emotional, impulsive military child who has recently had his world shaken up. I want to shake him and yell at him but can’t and I just sit here and cry instead. His current punishment is to sit alone and do nothing on the kitchen floor. I told him to think hard about what he did today and he just doesn’t get it. I just want good days. I want a Son I can be proud of all the time. I want to be able to hear my phone ring during school hours and not feel my stomach drop. I want to not feel like his behavior is my fault. I want a happy kid.

How to explain a miscarriage to my 7 year old daughter?,"I just received an email from my daughter’s school that her teacher lost her pregnancy at 18 weeks. They’ve asked that we tell our children privately what happened, and to emphasize not asking questions to the teacher when she returns. 

My daughter is very sensitive and hasn’t dealt with loss before, though she does understand the concept of dying.. I’m not sure how best to explain what happened without just saying the baby died? We are not religious so I can’t explain it in those terms either.

Son's Birthday Party (Low RSVP Count),"Hi everyone!

We recently moved to a new town and my son wanted to invite his (kindergarten) classmates to his birthday party (which occurs next Saturday). Our new place isn't big enough for more than a couple kids and with the uncertainty surrounding mid October weather, we opted to find an indoor facility.

I surveyed some parents and despite this Saturday being a long weekend, the response was very positive in terms of availability and willingness to join the celebration. So we booked a venue (which unfortunately isn't cheap, but that part is beside the point in this case, because we agreed to do it).

""All of his friends"" have told him that they will be coming. He's named about 10 of them. However, the reality is only 3 parents have rsvp'd yes, some have rsvp'd no, and the majority have neither responded to my email (or last night's follow up email) or viewed the electronic invitation. I'm concerned he will have fewer than rsvp'd yes actually show up, because that's what tends to happen in my experience, as last minute things come up for people.

Any advice on how to head this off and temper my son's expectations? The money spent and parents (hopefully well intentioned) inability to make it after originally giving the thumbs up is not my son's responsibility and I want to make sure he doesn't feel like his friends abandoned him. He's at the age that promises mean the world (do you blame him?) And he is very sensitive to what he interprets as a broken promise.

Thanks in advance.",parenting
Toddler Boys hugging my daughter,"Probably shoulda wrote, Kid boys hugging my daughter.

Happened today, and find myself evaluating if I'm being ridiculous or not. Figured why not seek out other parental advice?

I went to pick up my 4-year-old daughter from school and as she was putting on her backpack, 3 boys jumped up to go in and hug her saying ""Hug me, hug me!"". She just froze and stood there and didn't say or do anything. I gently blocked two of the boys from hugging her and said, ""She's putting on her backpack, no hugging please."". While I was paying attention to the two, another one got in there before I could prevent him. I had a quick snap of thought to pull him away from her, but stopped myself and allowed it to happen. It felt very uncomfortable for me, but I have no idea how my daughter felt about it.

One of the kids snapped to me and said: ""You're not my daddy or my mommy, shut up"". Told the kid to get out of here, but admittedly had the thought to toss him across the room. Lil' shit.

Overall, I guess I'm wondering if I'm overthinking this thing or not. I don't want my daughter hugging boys in the class and letting kids invade her personal space because she doesn't know how or understand that it's okay to reject. I wonder if she even cares, or thinks anything of it at all. My wife agrees that she's uncomfortable by it, and we've tried telling her that it's okay to say no to hugs. What is the general consensus to this thing? I get that the boys are too young to place any sexual connotation to the action. Maybe it's my being an adult placing the act of an unsolicited hug in a negative light? I probably wouldn't care if a little girl hugged her, so it's definitely about it being a little boy. Now I wonder if the teacher is allowing this during the day? Should I talk to her? All I know is that it made me feel uncomfortable at the moment, and I don't want random boys putting their hands on my kid.",parenting
Child Care Advice,"Sorry in advance for the long post, but hoping to get some advice.

My wife and I have an awesome daughter and for the past 6 months my mother-in-law has been driving to our house to take care of the baby while we're at work. She's not old enough to retire and she quit her job to take on this role. We pay her slightly more than what we would pay for daycare. Unfortunately, there have been multiple times this year where she has texted us while we're getting ready for work to say she can't make it that day (shingles, migraines, urinary tract infection, etc.). This has caused a ton of anxiety for both me and my wife as we're being forced to call out from work with short notice in addition to paying my mother-in-law for that day. 

We're now trying to decide if we'd be better off having our daughter in daycare. I feel guilty because our daughter loves her grandmother and lights up when she comes in the door. My mother-in-law is also great with our daughter and takes care of a lot of the household chores while the baby naps. I know that my daughter won't get the amount of attention there as she does at home which kind of bums me out, but I also think she might benefit developmentally by being around other kids.

For those of you that have in-home child care, how do you handle your nanny's ""sick days""? Are we being selfish?",parenting

is this an overreaction? night nurse mistake,"so, we carefully researched and heard good reviews about a doula service in our city that offers night nurse help. we reluctantly tried it out as we don’t have family anywhere nearby and run a small business with no maternity leave possible (husband and wife team).

we hired this service to just try and catch up on sleep a couple nights a week. the nurse stays at your place and basically sits next to the bassinet to feed and console and calm the baby over night. our little baby is 7 weeks old.

this morning, we woke up minutes after the nurse left to see our baby in the crib with two blankets on (not the swaddles we specifically always use and in a certain way so the fabric is never above shoulders and is always snug. well, this AM we were shocked to not only see blankets in the crib, but our baby was completely covered (her face was) by the blankets. my wife happened to wake up out of nowhere because her intuition told her to check on the baby. we are thanking God because she walked in to see the blankets over the baby’s face. the baby is fine and hadn’t been struggling to breathe yet, but we all know the horror stories.

so, we are deeply concerned, of course. at first we thought we were overreacting but now processing this we realize, wow, that is pretty much the worst thing a night nurse could do, and it should be obvious that newborns and blankets in the crib don’t mix.

1.	we are firing the service and letting them know we won’t have them by again
2.	is that an overreaction? or an under reaction? meaning, should we also report this person to the businesses’ owner? we don’t want to hurt her livelihood and she has been great so far and we like her but we can’t imagine this kind of negligence happening again.

Pet Cat Possibly Endangering Infant,"

First time poster here.

I’ve had my sweet boy for 12 years. Having no children up until recently, I’ve always thought of him as precious to me as a human child would be. I’d sing to him, dance with him, and in general, loved him to pieces.  I’ve been so lucky to have him. 

Fast forward to today. I have a 3 month old baby girl. As I’m sure all parents experience, she has completely changed my world in the best way possible, and I love her more than anyone or anything, more than my cat . I could go on and on about how much we love her, but she’s not the subject of this post. 

My sweet boy has recently started pooping all over the house...always soft surfaces like beds, furniture and rugs. He has done this before when he’s been stressed, such as when we got a second cat and when we moved across the country. Ive always just cleaned it up. I never have punished him in any way, not even got angry at him. I’ve taken him to the vet and there’s nothing physiological causing this behavior. I think he just feels neglected with the new baby getting a lot of attention.

I’ve tried a lot of stuff like CBD oil, comfort zone plug ins, extra love and attention, citrus sprays to deter him (cats don’t like citrus), etc. Nothing is helping 

My baby girl isn’t mobile yet of course, but she will be soon, and I’m terrified she will get into cat feces. We clean it up as soon as we see it of course, but what if she gets there before we do?

I don’t know what to do! I don’t want to give up on him but I also need to keep my daughter safe.",parenting
Potty training books other than Oh Crap?,"I want to potty train my 2 year old daughter.

Where do you draw the line with your ex? And how do you enforce it?,"I need outside opinions because my family is all on my side and can't get perspective. 

My ex has the kids every third week. One is school aged. We have a high conflict relationship. Our daughter missed half of all the days of school when she was with her dad last year. The custody changed because of that. This new school year he's had them for two weeks of school. The first week she was 40 minutes late for one day. The second week she missed a full week of school because she was sick. 

I don't entirely believe him about her being sick for a couple reasons. One - she doesn't like school and would rather stay home, and it means she fakes being ill when she can; two - he has a history of keeping her home from school for no reason; three - she was well enough to sell girl Scout cookies while she was too sick to go to school, apparently. 

Honestly I'm livid. It's critical that she goes to school. She has learning difficulties and is getting support but she missed the first week of learning support because she wasn't at school. Shes been doing really well at her school this year and excited to go and this morning she was fake coughing and pretending to be sick because she doesn't want to go to school.

Atheist parents: do you plan to introduce your kids to religion? If so how?,"I was raised a Baptist but as I got older it all just started to just seem like mythology and hypocrisy to me.

Right now the 3 year old is going to a Christian (ish) preschool where they touch on the idea of God and Church but it's not overt or direct. It's a start but eventually I know the bigger question are going to come up. I still have a bit of time to decide an approach.

How to toughen up my kid,"my kid (kindergarten) is sweet. however, he is not very resilient to rough housing or new situations. he has developed a nervousness about school because there is a kid that tries to take his clothes away during gym class or some boys who are rougher than him on the playground. 

teachers are attentive and mostly intervene if there is crying and they have talked to the other kids and also suggested ways our son could avoid the situation. but the routine fear of interacting with these kids keeps him from enjoying school. the kids have a reputation of being naughty but in the range of ""naughty"" i have seen, it is pretty mild. they aren't angels but they are mostly just used to a rougher type of play.

While I want to intervene and speak with the teachers, I feel that he's going to have to learn how to deal with things like this in life and i would like him to learn how to figure it out while he is still in a relatively safe environment like school (dealing with relatively harmless kids). Other kids seem fine saying no and pushing back, and are not as fearful when they are harrassed.

Wanted to share an experience I had with my toddler (long),"My (31M) toddler (almost 3M) has been having trouble with hitting when he feels frustrated.  We've talked and talked about how hitting is not okay, and that he should stomp his feet or yell in his room if he's feeling angry or frustrated.  He is getting better, but regulating emotions is a struggle for even the best 2 year old's.  

A few nights ago, we were winding down for bedtime while watching a show on TV.  We told him before we turned the TV on that we would be watching just one show, then off to start the bedtime routine.  He agrees, saying ""Okay, Daddy.""  We do this often if he's been a good boy in the later part of the day.  

Fast forward to the end of the show, I say ""Alright bud, time to go brush your teeth.""  Toddler announces very rudely and angrily that he wants to watch another show.  I decline and restated what we agreed to before the show began.  Toddler proceeds to yell and closed fist hit me in the leg.  Not hard like an adult, but toddler hard, and he definitely reacted out of anger.

I was fuming.  Getting hit is never pleasant, but it's especially bad when this is something we've been working on for some time now.  I roughly picked him up and we sped through the teeth brushing and book reading process.  He usually gets to be interactive with the bedtime goings on, not this time.  Dad was not allowing any pleasantries here:  ""No, we don't get to find letters in the book, when we hit"" and ""No, you don't get to help brush your teeth, when we hit"".  Normally, there's some cuddles, songs, and conversations about our respective days before I leave his room. This time, as soon as the book was finished, I just said good night, tossed him his blanket, and turned the light off.  

This is a pretty big breach of our bedtime ritual, and bedtime is something I hold to be very sacred.  I always am comforted by the dialog my little person and I have at bedtime, but this time I was still angry, and toddler could tell I was angry.  I always say ""I love you, see you tomorrow, buddy."", as I leave his room at night, but not tonight.

As I was leaving his room in a huff, and as the door was closing, I hear my little guy barely mumble something under his breath.  I poke my head in the door and sharply ask what he was mumbling about.  He was curled up in a ball, probably cold because he had no blanket.  He replies, ""I love you"", in a meek voice.  

My precious little boy shared the acknowledgement of love that I typically do as a parent, because I wasn't feeling very parental.  At that moment, my son was a bigger person than I, and it caught me completely off guard.  I just lost it. 

I went back in his room, sat on his bed, held him, and ugly cried with him for what seemed like forever.  I told him over and over how he's still a good boy, that I'm so proud of him, that I love him too, and that it makes both of us sad when we hit.  When we both regained our composure, he fell right asleep.  I laid him down with his cuddle bear, then I went to my wife who had just laid our newborn down for the night.  I proceeded to sob all over her as I shared what had just happened.

Puppies and toddlers,"Hi everyone. My ffg fiance and I are thinking about getting a puppy very soon for several reasons:

▪︎security- we live on a property that is right off of a public trail that was vacant for a while and we get A LOT of trespassers. Some have been harmless and others were pretty scary. We also have thick walls and glass that is almost sound proof so we can't hear when someone comes up our driveway. 

▪︎ we lost our previouus dog not too long ago and we're really missing that connection

▪︎ our daughter absolutely loves dogs- totally obsessed with dogs. She has had interactions with other dogs recently but only for short periods of time. 

My only hesitation is that I have a 2 year old. She's a good child, not anymore rowdy than your average 2 year old. We've been working on how to pet doggies, to be gentle, where their no- no spots are (ears, tails, butts, and privates) and she's doing well. 

So here are my questions: 

Have you gotten a puppy with a toddler? 
How did they do together?

We are looking at German shepherds because that is what my fiance is familiar with. I've done a lot of research on it and they are one of the top most dog friendly breeds so thatis comforting.

Some disorientation, headaches, vomiting, a trip to urgent care followed by the ER, and a clear CT later we were left to go home and told, among other things, to keep him home from school and follow up with his Pediatrician in a day or two.    


This is where it gets infuriating.  My wife lost her job about a year ago and with it our health insurance.  In order to have access to health care for our son we started to enroll him in a clinic in our town which specializes in offering assistance to those without insurance.  It's not a free clinic associated with a medical center or anything like that.  It's a regular doctor's office who is well known for being the best at finding a way to get people access to healthcare.  We started the enrollment process with them because that was their advice, filled out some paperwork etc, to see what could be done.   Partway through they figured out we were eligible for a free insurance program through the state that his old doctor accepts.  We called the old doctors office and verified with them that they accept it an he could stay as a patient with the new insurance and never finished the enrollment at the new place.  I just called up the office to schedule the followup and was informed me that they listed him as having transferred to the new doctor and they aren't accepting new patients so we cannot be seen there, period.  I called the place we started to fill out the paperwork, but they don't have his records and won't see him as a new patient until he has a well visit first, which of course we cannot do because he isn't well.    


So, we have no doctor to follow up with and all I really want to do right now is strangle somebody.  I'm going to keep calling pediatric offices until someone takes pity on me or, barring that go back to urgent care on Tuesday.  If anyone has a better suggestion I could really use it right now.",parenting

My girlfriend doesn’t want to keep our baby but I do,"I love my girlfriend.. we have a baby due on Halloween and up until the last month or so she has been saying she wanted to keep him, which I have been completely on board with. Now she is telling me to choose her or the child and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been begging her to give the child a chance but she wants no part of it. We even got a larger apartment and pretty much everything we need to care for the baby earlier in her pregnancy. A lot of people would say she’s just being hormonal... but I think she’s serious, I don’t want to lose her or the baby, but if she leaves because of the baby I don’t know if I’ll be able to take care of it on my own.. I need advice.",parenting
So tired..,"Almost a 15mo on the 13th. I'm trying my best.. being a mom is hard. Baby fights me almost every night to get to bed but her daddy can get her down in 10-15 minutes. I am at the brink of ripping our my hair and punching a wall in frustration. No wonder why my pastors wife does that.. lol..pure frustration or chemical imbalance who knows. 
I feel like a horrible mom. My husband hates her screaming bloody murder when I put her down so he does it. I feel like my kid hates me. Husband is lacking sleep. He's ticked off. 
I need more mom friends that are around my age  (29).. I started late on having kids. I want more cause that's what we planned when we had our first date. I want a big family. Just dealing with the frustrations is hard. I dont know how to cope with it.",parenting
Anxiety about preschool,"TLDR: my 3 year old is anxious about school, do I stop sending him since I'm home anyway?
  

Well ""3 year old classroom"" rather than preschool.
I recently put my 3 year old into half day preschool (9-1130, Monday Wednesday and Friday) He was SO excited at first. He's usually home with me or his dad during the days we don't work (I'm very part time and a student so I'm home more than anyone). The idea was just to get him used to other kids and have some fun with other people during the day. It's been a few weeks and all of the sudden he cries about going all through the weekend up until he's getting ready to walk into the school building. He told me he doesn't like how loud the kids are and that he just wants to be with me.


I don't know what to do. He isn't one to have meltdowns like this. I'm not sure if it's worth going through all this if he doesn't necessarily need to go yet. I know he'll need to get used to it one day but would it be terrible to take him out this year if he's having this hard of a time adjusting? I have bad anxiety and had a ROUGH time with school. It never got easier for me and I don't want to do that to him but...I just don't really know what to do. Advice is welcome! All of it lol thank you!",parenting
It's been a long day 😵,"Raising my boys (20 months and 6 months) has already been one hell of an adventure, and this week has been very VERY tough. 

Baby 1, baby 2, and I were out in the backyard, just hanging out and enjoying the heat. I'm on my younger son's play mat, trying to teach him... I dunno crawling or something... and oldest is off playing with the dog. 

All of a sudden, I my oldest belly laugh. I look up and he and the dog are playing with a stick together, dog is going for the stick and oldest is giggling. It was a super sweet moment. They get along so well. 

My oldest goes to put the stick in his mouth to get the dog to take it. I'm totally fine with my boys getting dirty, but putting a dirty stick in their mouth is where I draw the line. So I go over to take the stick. Then I scream.

You may be asking why I screamed. I suggest you not ask that and stop reading now. 

You freaks still here? Fine.

The stick was actually poop. Poop that looked like a stick. I scream and go to take the poop (which has split in half at this point) away. Oldest thinks mommy is SO FUNNY. He starts running, a poop in each hand. So I'm running after him, screaming at him to drop the poops. He's laughing and bolting, dog is barking and chasing me. It's a disaster. 

I finally catch him, run inside and throw him in the tub. This is where he will stay until he's 18.

Breastfeeding,"Hi all,

First time mum here. My son is 15 weeks old and his feeding has changed in the past week.

He’s been exclusively breastfed since birth and we’ve had no issues with latching or feeding - he’s always been a good feeder with a healthy appetite.

In the last week or so, he’s constantly pulling himself off the breast. It’s not as though he’s full (it’s only 5 minutes into a feed sometimes). I try to change positions around, which works for a couple more minutes. I try stopping to burp him and start again, which again, works for a couple of minutes. I try changing breasts. It’s all so hit and miss. 

Is this normal behaviour for breastfeeding as time goes on? I suspect he’s going through a developmental leap at the moment, so I’m sure his inquisitive nature is somewhat responsible, but I don’t think it’s entirely to blame. 

Any suggestions/similar experiences/advice?",parenting
The mother of my stepdaughter (10) removed her door from her bedroom because she slammed it. Are we right to be concerned or are we just really overthinking it?,"I’m on mobile so I apologise for formatting and/or spelling.

So, I’m going to preface by stating that although stepdaughter (SD) is entering puberty she is by no means aggressive or violent. Of course, she’s sassy and testy but I mean what teen isn’t? Her mother has never communicated any concern about her behaviour. 

So it came as a a bit of a shock for me and her father when SD called and told him she had the door removed because she slammed it and yeah. My husband tried asking more but the mother quickly told her she was out of time and couldn’t speak anymore and cut the call. Now, I’ve been a teen And also the daughter of divorced parents and I get that she calls to tests her moms rules and role by calling my husband. But when he called to ask if all is ok she didn’t answer and just texted that all was fine.

But it’s been some time now that the kids have all their phone calls with my husband always on speaker phone. And we’ve been getting some off comments about the partner of their mother and how he treats them and what not. 

Now I know kids, specially entering puberty can be dramatic and stretch out the truth but am I crazy to think that taking off the door is a bit too much?! Like is this normal? I come from a Latino family and this wasn’t the case at all. I just don’t know and neither does my husband. So my question; is taking off a door because slamming normal? At 10?! When she’s starting to grow and develop? (already got her period) are we just crazy? And if we’re not- what’s the protocol- what should we do?

TIA and sorry if I just sound crazy",parenting

Stressing myself silly - skin rash,"Let me start off by saying clearly: I am taking her to the doctor first thing tomorrow morning (its 8pm at night here right now), regardless of any responses I get here so Im not asking for medical advice. But I am 25 weeks pregnant and my stress levels are through the roof and I just need to talk to other parents. 

Last monday my 2.5 year old had some mild cold symptoms, runny nose, mild fever and she had conjunctivitis, cough here and there but not persistent. She was better by Thursday. Saturday night I noticed she had a few red bumps on her shoulders. I thought it was just heat rash because its been really hot here the last few days. The next day I could find anything on her so I dismissed it. Tonight bathing her I noticed the rash on her shoulders is back and has gotten worse. Large red splotches made up of smaller bumps. It doesnt seem to bother her at all. But she has been acting funny the last few days, extra whiny, needy, lots of attitude. But I just thought thats normal “terrible twos” mood swings. 

Of course dr google has made me stress about measles. And the hormones are driving normal stress into “palpitations and dizziness” levels of stress. She is fully vaccinated too. 

Someone tell me I can calm down for now and that the dr will get to the bottom of it tomorrow. Or the opposite and tell me I’m right to stress. Im driving myself crazy here.

Edit: this morning there was no sign of the rash and she seemed 100% like her usual self. Thanks for all the responses! Seems like I worried for nothing :)",parenting
"Going through an ugly divorce, father moved overseas and 3 year old is acting out. Advice please!","My 3 year old is clearly going through a hard time.

Another teacher must come to the class to take her outside. Her class is practicing for their end-year concert and she does not want to practice. I am worried sick about her. She only acts out at school, at home she is very relaxed. 

When I drop her off at school she does not cry, and seems to enjoy it. She also regressed in her potty training, and does it in her panties.

The unending cycle of sleep,I am a newish dad to my stepdaughter of just a few months shy of 5 years old. My daughter always has a lot of energy and bedtime feels unending some days. She doesn’t do it often but it feels like it’s getting more frequent .  She has started to wake up in the middle of the night about 3 or 4 hours into the night screaming at the top of her lungs that she is hungry. She gets a bedtime snack right before she goes to bed so she is never really hungry. If we feed her she will go to sleep for maybe 30 minutes or less before she does the same thing. If we deny her food and we just offer a drink she will only continue to cry she is hungry. When you walk away she then says she is thirsty since that is what you offered. After that she has been biting her cheek (I think because of how tired she is) and crying about the immense pain. She will do this process for hours. Unfortunately we have a 4 month old she like to wake up with this act. We have tried ignoring what she wants and just cradling her and rocking her but then she just cry’s she is lonely once she calms down and we put her to bed. It seems like she is waking up agitated because she can’t sleep and looking for attention but we can’t seem to figure out how to console her. I am hoping someone else has had a similar experience and might have some thoughts. Right now we are thinking of trying to get her into bed mode earlier and relax longer before going to sleep.,parenting

When did co-parenting stop focusing on the kids?,"I am the father too two children.  One of them is from a one stand and the other is from my current relationship.  The child from my current relationship is not my biological child but the child's father has never been involved from the beginning.  I would like to ask two questions from my one night stand.  Both will be brief and end with questions this community.

1. Ho do i approach this with the mother and put an end to it? 

For the purpose of this post lets refer to my one night stand child as B.  B's mother is using our child to hurt me.  An example of this would be as follows.  When i pick her up for my court order time, within the first 5 minutes i have B, B will say one of a few phrases ""Dad, why do you not want to live with me and mommy, mommy says its because you wanted to live on your own.  Mommy says you are a liar and she wants me to not be like daddy"" or my personal favorite ""Daddy, i dont live with you i just visit you because mommy says i have to""  Here is the honest reason we didnt work out, I texted a co worker some things i should of, I confessed and said I cant continue to be in the relationship.  Ya i did something i should not of but not enough to warrant those phrases from my child. 

Please to all the mothers in the world.  NEVER let you children say these words to the other parent.  And fathers, NEVER let your children believe their mothers are right.

2. When do my rights as a parent become honored by the court and other parent? 

Ok this is a little confusing but to put it frankly, I dont get a say in B's schooling because her mother does not discuss it with me.   Decides to tell me a few days before the start.  I am then pitted between what my child wants and what is right for B.  I dont get say in what functions she is in because her mother will sign her up and say to me ""she does not have to go to these activities when its you time its ok"".  But then when i get B all she talks about is wanting to go to these events.  Am i suppose to tell my child no because she has to be with me? 

Parents weather married, separated or whatever else should never use a scenario to get what they want for their child.  If you think this is okay just read what happens to me weekly and give me one reason its okay that does not come from a place of self interest and we will talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know not as brief as i would like but there is so much i am leaving out because what i really need is a healthy discussion.  If you have questions please ask for more information and i will provide.

TL;DR - Why is it that co parenting has become this leveraging act.  Where a parent uses their child to inflict hurt or pain by using their children to get what they want.  Is this normal or am I just an idiot.",parenting
Grown &amp; Gone- It’s like I mean nothing.,"My only child (son) is 23 years old. I had him when I was 18. His father was killed in a car accident when he was 11 months old. It was kind of like us us vs. the world. We were always super close and I worked incredibly hard to get us into a nice home in a great area. I married his stepfather when my son was 12. He was a blessing straight from God. He loves my son with all that he is. My son knows this. After graduation, my son shipped off to boot camp and became an infantryman in the Marines. It felt as if he was ripped away away and though I knew I would miss him, NO contact for the 1st 3 months spun me into a completely unexpected panic disorder. It was a long 4 years. He finished his 4 years and has been back home for a little over a year. He works full time and is in college full time. He has been out of the Marines for one year. His best friend also recently finished his 4 years in the Marines. Their plan was to move in together and they did. I am a 2nd Mom to the best friend. My son has NEVER been one to express emotions. I even took him to therapy at 16 to try and help. It didn’t. I grew up dirt poor and worked incredibly hard to better our lives. And I did and he had everything he needed/wanted. We were always close and his friends love me. He however is always nasty towards me, doesn’t say thank you and never steps up to do anything for myself or my husband. He was always financially responsible and mindful of credit. Then he met a very plain girl and she is 100% not his type m. She has ZERO personality. It’s impossible to connect with her and she is now living with him!!! After 10 weeks. She is manipulating and he now has zero money and maxed out credit cards. I never get to see him. His own best friend and roommate says he’s lost his friend. I can’t for the life of me figure out what he is getting out if this. But, we still pay his cell phone, EXPENSIVE car insurance and healthcare. It’s over 1K a month. Meanwhile, he is out blowing ALL of his money and continues with the mean, ungrateful attitude. The only “card” I have to play is not paying for those items anymore. My mother in law says to try and talk again to him in a way that would speak to him rather than push away. I miss my kid and it hurts so much that he just doesn’t care. Not to mention the German Shepherd we HAD to have that he cared for for 2 weeks and then abandoned her on us. He does NOTHING EVEF with her. Never shows up if I even need a slight favor. Please tell me what do you. I want to play chess, not checkers. But I’m at my breaking point!",parenting
How to handle jealousy,"So I was an intensely jealous kid. I always chalked that up to being a second (and unplanned) child. 

But today, I watched my cherished, planned, one-and-only 10-month old get CRAZY jealous when I briefly picked up the neighbor baby. She actually attempted to slap the baby out of my lap. (Which was kind of cute because it reminded me of a time when I dragged a neighbor kid by her pigtails off my mom’s lap at a picnic.)

In all seriousness, thought, too much jealousy is not a good thing. It really held me back in my childhood and teens; I don’t want my kid to struggle like I did.

Sudden sleep issues (4y/o male),"Any tips or tricks for a 4 year old who suddenly is uncomfortable sleeping on his own? Used to be our good sleeper. Normally we read him a book and sing him a song then close his door and he is out. Suddenly he needs us to sit at his door to be able to fall asleep. We have tried leaving his door open and checking on him frequently but he cries when we walk out and is upset about everything if we try to leave (blanket not right, nose runny, shot sleeve pjs don’t cover enough of his arms). Comes out multiple times a night just crying at our door. He isn’t the greatest communicator so it is hard to gauge what is going on. Some nights he sleeps through the night other nights we either sleep on his floor or he sleeps on our floor. The only change in routine is he just started Jk. No other traumas or etc.

Anyone else's preschooler experiencing this issue?,"Nobody wants to play with my 3 year old. It seems like a large percentage (like 90%+) of the kids who are around her age aren't interested in playing with other kids at all, and the bigger kids who are into playing with other kids don't want to play with ""a baby"". We run into this all the time at local playgrounds. I'm sure it will pass soon, but for right now it's pretty heartbreaking. We don't know anyone with a child her age who plays yet either. It's weird because I don't remember this happening with her older sister. It seemed like from the time she was tiny, all the kids would just play together. Maybe I'm not remembering it right?

My child developed a bad habit,"My wife and I are struggling right now with a “thing” my almost 3 year old boy started doing 3 weeks ago. He gets up literally 20-30 times per night.

A few weeks ago he finally learned to climb out of his crib. So we removed the front gate and turned it into a bed. The crib has both foot and head sides but no front so he can come and go as he pleases. We bought a small front gate that has openings on both side for him to get in and out of.

Anyways, since then it’s been absolutely awful. We put him to bed like we always have but as soon as we finish tucking him in, we go to the door or gently leave and crack the door, he jumps out and runs to the door, sometimes screaming. We have no choice but to go back and tuck him in all over again. This happens over and over, the first night we counted 26 times, some nights even worse.

This is very difficult for us, we are on no sleep, he’s waking up his brother in the next room whose 9 months old and it happens literally every night. I’ve held him, laid on the floor, rocked him, and still when I move for the door he freaks out. My wife and I do not want him sleeping in our bed at all or anywhere else, as we fear that will become a habit like things usually do with him.

Any ideas or has anyone struggled with this, we are in dire need of help.

Thanks a ton and we both really appreciate any help so we can finally sleep.",parenting

My Wife (F33) wants another baby and I (M32) don't (because I think we financially can't afford another one),"We've been married since 2011, have two (F2 &amp; M4) beautiful children, she's been pushy telling me that she wants another child, which I'm not totally opposed to, but I don't think we can financially sustain.

I've told her that we have debts in the bank, at my work and with my mother (about USD 7K in total) and that her job (at a private school) only gets a scholarship for 2 children (where I live, public education is a no go). For the third child we would have to pay full tuition, which would leave us in more debt.

She does all the finances on the house, I give her all the money I earn and keeps her earnings to later spend it on the house, services, kids, my share, etc. I have no problem with that at all, thats how we work and I trust her with that 100%.

We currently have two jobs each and can barely (in my impression, because sometimes at the end of the month we have no money and have to get money from wherever we can to pay services, etc.) support our lifestyle.

*My jobs are 9 to 5, and 8 to midnight, so I can be with my kids from 6 to 8 and all weekend, her jobs are 7 to 4 and saturdays, so I don't think we spend as much time as we should with the kids*

So... I told her that if she wanted another kid, all debts would have to be gone, and we should have at least 1k in the bank in savings so I could be at peace and agree with her.

Today she brought the ""do you want a baby brother/sister?"" to the kids, which I didn't really appreciate, but  brushed it off as something  childish. I reminded her of the conditions I had to have another kid and she asked me ""Why do I have to do everything? Why do I have to pay the debts and get the savings?"" to which I answered ""Because YOU are the one who wants another kid!""... well apparently that was not the correct answer, she flipped out, and told me that she might aswell find it elsewhere!

I kind of feel awful right now, I'm at my home but feel a heartache... I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR:** Have anybody been in this situation? where you're not totally opposed to having another kid, but you KNOW you're not going to be able to support your current lifestyle and don't want it just for that reason? is it a valid reason not to want another kid?

My daughter started her “womanhood” today. She’s only 10.,"My daughter started her period...well, yesterday, actually. And she was very successful in hiding it at her grandma’s, where she was for the night. 

Now that we’re dealing with it at home, I’ve repeated a million times “this will happen once a month, sometimes less, sometimes more”, “this is completely normal, every girl goes through this”, and a full-armed karate chop (obviously no power behind it) from hip to hip trying to explain where cramps will be to symbolize a precursor to the blood. 

I’ve taught her to use the pads, made her use one herself, and put one in her backpack for school. 

According to my family, I am the absolute worst pep talk giver in the universe, and I need to do better. But here’s the kicker - SHE’S ONLY TEN. Literally just turned 10 this past summer. 

I’m looking for advice, YouTube recommendations, anything that will help me. She’s in 4th grade, and the students here don’t get the health class talk until 5th grade where we live, and they apparently don’t have a school nurse. I’m looking for literally anything to make her feel more comfortable in this situation. I don’t know what to tell her to make her feel more comfortable about the situation, or why she was hiding it from everyone. 

Any assistance greatly appreciated

Tired. Depressed. Or both?,"Now this will seem like a rant and that’s partially true but it’s to set the scene for my questions. 

I am a 33[m] married to my 34[f] wife for 4 years now and been together for 15 years total. So this way you know this isn’t a new relationship.  Our son is going to be 3 in two months time. Now you have our bio info. 

To jump back in time to pregnancy.  From the moment your doctor confirms you are pregnant a whole slew of things happen. But most importantly there is a network of doctors, nurses, midwives, technicians, friends, family, etc that are there to support you and make sure you and the unborn baby feel okay and are doing okay.  Once that baby is born.....that team you relied on for 9 months to help through every concern you had, every ounce of stress that was mitigated to put you at ease, your bank of knowledge that you could pull from day and night.......POOF......gone as fast as it came.  

Now you’re at home, with your partner, with your crying child and can’t figure out if he is hungry, tired, lonely, dirty diaper and your stress builds and builds until you start snapping at your partner and they are snapping back at you all the while creating this feedback loop of misery and fatigue.  Where is your help now????

You think “oh I’ll tell my mom friends who have been through this....they’ll understand” or “I’ll find an online support group of moms or parents in general...they’ll understand”. While some groups, like this one, do understand, a lot of the time all you hear is “welcome to parenthood.”  These sane people that were asking you “how are you doing today?” And “ how is the unborn child today” or “let’s get an ultrasound to make sure the unborn child is fine” are now telling you to “suck it up buttercup”.  Like somehow your feelings don’t matter anymore just because the baby is now outside of you instead of inside of you. 

Now you and your partner hear these things over and over and over for days and days turn into weeks and weeks to months and finally almost 3 years have gone by and it seems nothing has changed.  You wake up at 7am because your son woke up before you and shook your pillow to wake you up. The day has started you think to yourself. But you are still tired. You got 8 hours of sleep though. You wake the wife up. She’s tired and doesn’t want to wake up so you are forced to figure out how to change the child, feed the child, let the dogs out, get showered, get breakfast for yourself and try to get some work done (work at home job) all the whole you have to remember to wake the wife up again. 

I make it into my office. I’m awake now and ready to work. Work day goes by and the 3 yo is coming and going in and out of my office up and down my lap sitting on my desk until finally my work day is done. But now......it’s 5:30. The wife asks what’s for dinner. I don’t know everything is frozen still. I get told that I should have pulled something out of the freezer this morning.  Apparently that’s also my job while the wife was playing with our son all day long. 

Nighttime routine for child comes around.  I take home to bed because if I relied on my wife the child would never have a schedule and he would go to bed at midnight instead of 8pm-9pm. I get him changed and into PJs and my wife comes in and hands him the toothbrush and leaves when he is done. It’s my job to sit with him until he falls asleep. 

Now I know if you are still reading this you’re thinking my wife wants very little to do with our son or being a good wife. While that may be true or it may not be that’s up for a couples counselor to decide. But I will say that my son is my shadow. Literally. I can’t walk from the living room to the kitchen without him asking me where I’m going or even following me. It’s the daddy show for sure. So even though my wife doesn’t put him to bed or get him up in the morning. It’s not because she doesn’t want to (maybe) it’s because our son won’t let her and wants me instead.  Psychoanalyze that however you want but that’s the long and short of it. 

My question is since I’m doing this same routine day in and day out I have the feeling of being tired ALL of the time. From when I wake up until I go to bed. Why am I so tired?  Is this depression?

How to get rid of a toy?,"I was cleaning out my daughter's toy box to get rid of old toys that she's outgrown and she latched on to this old infant toy that has a light on it and plays music. She insists on sleeping with it but then she turns it on all night and won't sleep.  She loves it and refuses to get rid of it.

Rocking 4 month old to sleep,"I think we're really lucky with our 4mo little boy. He sleeps through the night 6pm to 6am, is pretty much always happy and smiley and only fusses when going down for sleep.

We rock him for 10 -15 minutes and he's out. If we put him down (on his tummy) he'll get pretty worked up. We tried a process today where we let him cry for about 4 minutes... It took me 30 minutes to get him calm and asleep 

My partner is seriously stressing about rocking him and listens to all the mum podcasts saying kids should be able to go down on their own.

I'm not too concerned and consider us super lucky. Thoughts? Is rocking him to sleep gonna bite us in the ass, or should we keep rocking this gravy train for as long as possible?",parenting
Toddler girl not super attracted to dad,"My husband (34M) is having hard time because our 15-month-old daughter never really found him comforting. She loves playing with him but as soon as she is sleepy, tired, hungry or in pain she pushes away from him, screams at the top of her lungs if he hugs her. At nights if he goes to her when she wakes up she just screams (this bothers him the most because he is ""helpless"" and I am ""tortured"").

It doesn't help that I have been breastfeeding all her life, I breastfeed her to sleep and at nights. I also usually am the one to give her food. Around dinner time she hugs my legs while I cook and won't go to him no matter how he bribes her. 

How can I help him overcome these feelings or how can he become more comforting to our daughter?

yelled at my one year old,"Yup, I yelled at my one year old twice in two days for no good reason at all. I immediately feel so guilty because he is only crying to communicate and I came undone for a little while. both times we were on our way to pick mom up for work and I could do nothing to console him, he just kept screaming for 20 minutes. I want to say that both times I came undone I wasn't looking at him, my voice just became elevated followed with the question "" why are you crying there is no reason to cry"".  I'm fully aware that yelling is always useless and mine and my SO's parenting style is calm explanation if he is doing something he is not suppose to be doing. lately I've been stressed due to recent job security coming to question, 4-6 hours of interrupted sleep, and other normal stress's related to raising a 1 year old.

Can I start a discussion about Screens/video games?,"I have an 11 and a 13 year old and this has become a continuous topic for us.

The hours they spend on a screen are way beyond what I'd like.

Parenting a Difficult 18 Year Old Son,"A bit long, so I do apologize.  This is my first post.

I have one child, an 18 year old son.  I love him very much, but honestly don't like him very much right now.   I was divorced 5 years ago and there was infidelity on my ex's part, so my son didn't have a great deal to do with him for his high school years.    I did not try to keep them apart, but I honestly don't think I tried enough to bring them together.  I am far from the perfect parent.  

So, when he graduated high school (we lived in the Austin area), he was going to attend KU and I was going to move back to Kansas City, where my family lived.   I moved up to KC and he wanted to stay in Austin for a final summer with his friends, but would come to KC and move into the dorms in August.  He reluctantly agreed to stay with my ex, which I thought would be a good opportunity for them to spend some time together.  

So, a week after I moved, he called me and told me he decided not to go to KU and he was staying in Austin to go to community college.   I am sure his dad convinced him that this would be best.    I was pretty upset that day, but decided to suck it up and just tell him to do what he thought was right.    He has a girlfriend that also lives in Austin.   

So, he has been living with my ex and going to community college.  We text and I ask him about his classes and girlfriends, etc.  I read over all my texts several times to just make sure they aren't passive aggressive, but I feel like I have to walk on eggshells.  We used to be very close, but we aren't now.     He texted me that he wouldn't be up for Christmas, but that could come up after the new year.   I texted back "" I am disappointed, but will have to get solid dates from you as I can't always take off work after the new year.""  He told me I was being ridiculous and that I overreact to everything.  He told me to stop texting him.   I am just heart-broken.    I understand he is getting older and needs to have his own life, but I let him know that I expected to at least be a part of the conversation about the holiday trip.   I have to buy his ticket and I need to make sure I can be off work.     

He is my only child and I love him, but the last few months have been pretty miserable.  He is selfish.  He is disrespectful.   I sort of dread when I see him text me.   He is coming up on Thanksgiving, but I am not excited.  And that really makes me sad.   I just don't know exactly what to do.   I don't want to be some narcissistic parent, but I feel like he makes decisions without consulting me and then gets super angry when I say that might not work for me.  

I just don't know.  I am depressed about it.   I know this just sounds silly, but I don't know exactly how to manage a difficult 18 year old boy.  My ex just says he is 18 and that I should get over it.   I want to have a good relationship going forward, but I don't want to be a doormat.   How do you balance those things?  Any advice?  I am open for anything.",parenting
Safety tip for bath time :),"Another redditor here posted about her little one drowning not that long ago and it inspired me to change the way I do bath time. Even just turning your back for one moment could end in tragedy so what I started doing was having my daughter sing any time I need to quickly run out of the bathroom and grab something. I just tell her to sing the ABC's or whatever and that way I can always hear her especially since she loves to sing as loud as she can and makes it kind of a game. Figured I'd share this since I hadn't heard of any other ways to keep tabs on kids when it's ""absolutely necessary"" to look away for a moment (which I try to avoid doing but if I have to, at least I do it this way).

How to stop granddaughter calling me mommy?,"My 3 year old granddaughter calls me a mix of mommy and grammy, but mostly mommy. My daughter and her husband work long hours so typically I'm there when she wakes up and I put her to sleep, and my daughter only gets to spend time with her on the weekends. I understand why my granddaughter is confused, and I figured she'd grow out of it eventually. Recently my daughter got very upset over hearing her call me mommy, so waiting for her to grow out of it isn't an option anymore and I don't know what to do.


When she was younger I always corrected her, but often she'd get very upset over it so I stopped. Her older sister (5) always corrects her, and she gets upset then too. She's very sensitive, so even if I gently say ""I'm grammy, not mommy"", it can make her tear up. Does anyone have ideas on how else to correct her?",parenting
Dealing with a 3 year old who is/thinks she is the boss,"My daughter is 3 and a half and generally brilliant. She is polite and kind and funny. But she is sooooo stubborn and it seems to make it really tough for us not to let her get her way all the time.

For example, as I write this it's quarter past ten at night and she is still awake - she is usually asleep by quarter to eight. The reason she is still awake is because she decided she wanted to go to sleep in our bed tonight (which she has done maybe 5 or 6 times in the past year when she has been ill for instance) and we said no and enforced this. This resulted in tantrums, hitting, arguments about the lights being on (she says she is scared of the dark), several 'essential' trips to the toilet and a general refusal to even attempt to go to sleep in her room. I think we coped with it fairly well at first but after an hour and a half I resorted to shouting and threats to turn all the lights off and make her sleep in the dark (which I regret now and feel pretty shitty about :( - needless to say it only made things worse).  


This is one example, but another example was the other day when we had cooked banana cake in the day together. We had said she could have some after she had finished her dinner. She flat out refused to even try the dinner - to which we tried to make it not a big deal with 'ok, that's fine - you can go and play then but no dinner - no cake'. At this she had a meltdown and refused to try her dinner but also refused to get down from the table demanding cake - for maybe just over an hour. She never did get any cake and eventually just wandered off to watch telly or something - but that hour and a bit was stressful.  
Basically anytime we tell her she can't do something she really wants to do, she pretty much just ignores us and trys to do it anyway and if we really enforce it she has an absolute meltdown and there seems to be no reasoning with her. Her stubbornness is so strong that it can feel like the impasse is never going to end.   


I'm not sure the best way to approach this - or if there even is a best way? Maybe it's just her age and all kids are a bit like this (she is our first so we don't have much experience in this regard). But it can be pretty demoralising and depressing as I just want to have fun with her and don't want to spend hours at a time in a battle.",parenting
Son’s teacher keeps commenting on his hair,"   My son (9) is in the 4th grade at a medium sized school in the south. His hair is in a shaggy surfer boy style, about collar length. I don’t know how else to describe it. He has beautiful golden brown hair with a few lighter highlights that I have put in myself. He loves his hair and has never had anything but positive comments from adults and friends alike. 
Until this year. 
   We went to orientation the week before school started. His teacher made two comments within an hour, along the lines of “Oh, I hope you get a haircut before school starts! I can hardly see your eyes!” It is nowhere near covering his eyes, he has a side part sort of and wears it that way. 

I bit my tongue at those comments. He came to me yesterday and said that she has asked him several more times when he will be getting a haircut. 
   He is confused why his teacher cares so much about his hair, as am I, and doesn’t really know how to respond to her. 

   I have told him to tell her that if she has any more questions about his hair she can come to me. 
   Is there any advice that anyone has? Or maybe some reasoning behind her questions that I’m missing?",parenting

Potty training not going well,"My first born got it down in a week at 2, my second isn't getting it at all. She's 2.5 and we have been training for 2 months. She has accidents several times per day.

Aggressive toddler (2) is making me hate being a mom (22),"My 2yo toddler is very aggressive. He constantly beats us by smacking us in the face or anywhere possible. Recently he learnt how to punch. A few days ago he punched me in the eye so hard I started tearing up and it was swollen for a while. That eye hurt for 2 days. 

I’m shocked at how strong he is but I guess it’s because he’s very active and full of energy 24/7. We don’t even like taking him out because he wouldn’t sit on a trolley and would run around or scream while other families have well-behaved kids. Very frustrating. I don’t know where he gets the aggression from but I’m thinking the way his father plays rough with him may be a factor. They pretend fight each other and I always told him to stop playing too rough with our kid. Maybe he sees it on TV too? Maybe he’s bored at home? I don’t know. 

We scold him every time he hurts anyone but this has no effect and he doesn’t care. When he throws tantrums we don’t give in at all and let him finish. I’ve tried speaking calm and nicely, it doesn’t work. I’ve tried being “angry” he’s unbothered.

I’m just fed up at this point since we’re already in a really bad situation and he adds up to my stress by being naughty. I know he’s still small and doesn’t understand cause and effect but I’m desperate. It doesn’t help that his dad’s mother would tell me to do something about it. I’m trying??? 

I already resent being a young mom sometimes and I’ve been depressed about how my life changed since he was born. I have breakdowns every now and then but I’m trying so hard because he deserves to be loved and it wasn’t his choice to be brought into the world. 

I don’t even know how I feel because it’s just a mix of emotions. He’s a good boy, he understands a lot, knows how to ask for what he wants, and he’s also independent except the aggression is too much and he doesn’t listen when it comes to the bad things he does. He doesn’t hit other kids though but I’m worried he won’t get rid of his habit of hitting others and it would become worse in the future. 

I’m researching for books that could be helpful. I’m thinking maybe he should attend activities or have more interaction with other kids? Please give me some hope this behavior can be corrected.",parenting
Parenting “that” kid. How do you deal with the judgment?,"Kid started Kindergarten and is having a hard time. No discipline problems like fighting but a lot of behavioral things like crying and getting mad at minor things like a crayon breaking. Then he will be so riled up he has to step outside the classroom...like multiple times a day. It is far above the typical adjustment period. 

Actually this is not the hard or surprising part. He did 2 years of preschool, where he had a hard time. We have done all the due diligence with doctors, teachers, therapists and have a system set up behind the scenes. We have a string of official dxs that I am emotionally and psychologically comfortable with. 

But the hardest part is the new level of scrutiny in K. Lots of curious eyes from new kids who are making their own conclusions and staying away from the crying kid. Lots of curious eyes from new parents as we have a quick chat with the Special Ed teacher after school. Parents do not see an “obviously” disabled child who might go to a special classroom but a “normal” child whose handwriting and art are leagues behind, who cries and shouts from frustration, and has no friends. I feel like I shouldnt care because I love my child and we are supporting him 100% in ways that these strangers cannot even imagine. But it is stressful. This is a small community and people can be cruel.

My (26f) daughter (8m) is being very clingy and it's driving me crazy,"She used to just smile and be happy a lot of the time. Now, whenever I don't give her attention, she starts screaming as if the world's about to end. And I can't deal with the almost constant screaming anymore. I'm a single mom so there's no one who I can turn to, no one who can take her over for a little while so that I can get a break. 

And giving her attention is a lot less fun than it used to be as well. She pulls my hair, tries to eat my earring, scratches my face, and grabs everything around me. 

I'm honestly a bit over the baby stage. I have another kid who is a bit older and honestly, it's a lot easier. He may not listen to me a whole lot, but he understands what I say and can do a lot of things by himself. And he's a sweet kid overall. 

Both of them are sweet kids, really, and I love them to bits. I just find it really hard to stay calm when my daughter is screaming all the time, and I don't know what to do anymore.

Son's father is refusing to pay for tuition if my son goes to community college. Am I crazy for thinking this is insane?,"My ex husband and I divorced 7 years ago. We have 3 kids together.

Caught my 12 year old having cybersex,"Throwaway Account.

I don’t even know where to begin. My 12 year old son came out as bisexual the other day. We were supportive of his decision and gave him no grief at all. We let him know that nothing about anything has changed and he can be attracted to whomever he pleases.

My son has a bad habit of sneaking on his phone and devices after he’s supposed to be in bed. I get alerts when his phone is on, and last night it pinged at 1am, way past his bedtime. 

I snuck downstairs to see what he was doing, but he had apparently heard me and had placed the phone on his desk and played dumb when I asked him why he was on it. Upon touching the phone, I could tell by its warmth that it was recently on, at which point he fessed up to being on it. I scolded him a bit, and told him his phone was mine for the time being.

In what might go down as my biggest mistake thus far in life, I opened his phone to find some GRAPHIC pictures from a google search for ‘micropenises’... dumbfounded I told him that his phone was gone for good, and that he knew why. He apologized and laid back down.

Now, my kid ARGUES. I found it really strange he didn’t have anything to say to attempt to vindicate himself, and that prompted me to dig deeper on the phone. Within a few seconds of searching I found a discord chat he was in which included an hours long sexting session that went way beyond the norm. The other party was very domineering but also calling my son ‘daddy’ and other unmentionable shit that still has my stomach turned.

I looked even further and realized that he is in a bunch of servers that are for roleplay and cybersex. Needless to say, I’m still in shock. Prior to this, the worst he had done on his phone was look up ‘boobs’ on YouTube, now he’s engaging in conversations with what could very well be adults.

I grew up on AIM, Yahoo Messenger, Limewire, etc. I know full well how depraved the internet can be, especially towards younger children and creepy ass adults. Hell, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that I used to absolutely defile my parents computer growing up. My parents were just never savvy enough to catch me.


I’m at a complete loss at what to do here. I know that he’s going through a lot of changes and trying to find his identity, but I can’t just look the other way when potential grown men are sexting my son. 

I’m less concerned about legal recourse against the other parties as I am finding the least damaging way to deal with this with my son. He’s obviously punished and has no phone or computer for a LONG time, but I’m not even sure to have a conversation with him about this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The problem is that my 6 year old flat our refuses to perform in front of others. We allowed her to skip a piano recital last year based on advice, some from this sub, and that only made this problem worse. Right now she is doing soccer, which is something she picked and said she wanted to do, but any time all of the attention is on her she stops playing. She can't be goalie because she doesn't like the attention. Fine, but she won't even kick the ball now. She happily runs around and the moment the ball is kicked to her, she'll kick it away. My 12 year old practices with her in the backyard and she is pretty good. She'll kick and take shots. She won't on the actual game field though. 

The same goes for instruments. She will practice the piano without any complaints but won't partipate in recitials. We have had this issue in dance, teeball, soccer, and everything in between. She won't even do show and tell at school.

Feeling a bit discouraged,"We are a family of 3, my husband, our 2 yr old, and myself. Last week we moved into a new apartment. It is a 2 bedroom and the first time my son will be sleeping in his own bed. He slept in a crib for about 15 months, but there were a ton of different factors that had him co-sleeping with us after that and up until now. Anyways, my husband and I both agreed that the best way to do it for our son, was to fall asleep with him and then leave the room. Tonight was night 1. I put him to sleep and left. 3 hrs later, he wakes up, so I again put him to sleep and leave. Another 3 hrs later. He’s not going to sleep so easily this time. I guess he figured out the game, who knows. At this point it’s like 5:00am. I go to our room and ask my husband to tag me out. He tells me to just leave him in our bed because he did really good. I just leave and try again and he finally falls asleep. I just feel discouraged because we both came up with this plan on how we’d do this. I had to do it alone while my husband slept comfortably. 

Ugh. I’m just glad the kid is out.... for now.",parenting
Found a secret phone in my daughters room,"Backstory :  her phone was shattered and I could not afford to get her a new one for a few weeks.  She kept asking about the WIFI password so I figured she was trying to use her old tablet.  Last week I shelled out 200 on a new phone and she quickly got it taken away for missing assignments.  Last night she spent the night at grandmas house and I found an IPHONE! in her bed!    What will be a suitable punishment?  The phone I found has a password so I can't search it to even try to figure out who gave it to her.  

Would it be bad if I don't tell her I found it and make her sweat looking for it?  Or should I just her and force her to unlock it?

New Mum Doubts,"My baby boy is only 15 days old and I’m already doubting if I’m cut out for motherhood. He wasn’t planned and throughout pregnancy I had doubts but I told myself it was meant to be and I would love him when he arrived.

I do love him and this isn’t PPD. I’m exclusively breastfeeding and he generally sleeps for 1-2 hours between feeds. People warn you about tiredness when baby arrives but this is next level! I’ve always been notoriously grouchy when tired and I feel like it’s going to be a huge chunk of my life spent tired/grouchy. 

My partner works long hours but he still supports me immensely, I cannot imagine how I would cope without him. But I feel like a failure when I fall asleep in the middle of a night feed or when my partner takes over to settle him down when I know he must be exhausted too.

I know this routine won’t last forever and he will eventually start sleeping longer, but then I start to worry about how I’ll cope with a toddler, or a teenager! I just feel so I’ll equipped to be a mum.

I want another baby but should I?,"I love my son and he's so adorable even in his mean toddler age. But lately I've been thinking that at some point I want another baby and hopefully a girl but that's complicated.
When I had my first son there where complications and I'm very lucky to be alive right now. The doctors told me how close and bad it got and recommend I never have another kid.
But they dont know why it got complicated or anything... Should I risk it later in life? Idk this seems stupid and I probably won't but I can dream I guess.

Edit: 
Some ask what happened well all was going great till 4 days before predicted due date. His heart stopped for a moment so they induced me but even then it took 2 days before anything changed. Even then I never fully dilated so we had to do a csection. During the csection I hemorrhaged and lost nearly 3 times as much blood is normal. I was litteraly bleeding out and they had to fulling knock me out so they could fix me. When I woke up I was told I had needed 2 blood transfusions and even then they thought i would need a 3rd due to how dead I still looked. 
They dont know why I suddenly just gushed blood that seemed impossible for someone my size to loose and live. And informed me that trying again I might not be so lucky.

But y'all are right, the risk seems to high and I think I'll just have my tubes tied. Not risk my life and my son being alone in the world. Thank you.",parenting
3yr old cries for mama,"My wife and I have a daughter who is nearly 4. At bedtime we read stories and sing her to sleep every night. It's exhausting and usually whomever is putting her to sleep falls asleep in her bed.

Three nights of the week Mama is at work and Papa puts her to bed. Typically she falls asleep within half an hour of whenever I start reading.

If Mama is home, and Papa is doing bedtime, eventually daughter will start crying for Mama, and will cry and scream until Mama comes in to sleep with her.

Reaching a major transition,"My son turned 18 today.

It's hard to believe that the time passed so quickly. Seems as if it just *flew* by. I can't really describe the feeling, but I have a huge smile on my face - because I got him through. Well, he did most of it himself, of course. I know that I was lucky; I've never heard of **any** teen who was easier to raise than he has been. And that's despite the fact that I've been a single parent for the last three years or so. He's a good kid, and we get along great.

I've said it elsewhere, but I'll say it again: the best thing that you can ever do for your children and yourself is *read to them every night*. I hear parents complain that their teens have drifted away from them; that hasn't really happened with me and my son, except to the normal healthy extent that he's developed his own interests. But reading (and talking) every night **works**. And it's a lot of fun.

I'm looking forward to other major milestones in his life, even the ones that will be harder. I think he'll handle them well. He's ready for the world. And I couldn't be more proud of him.",parenting
Need advice about moving.,"Looking for advice from parents who have moved to different states away from their kids. Or advice in general.

My ex and I both moved to a different state due to her being in the military. We are currently going through a divorce but are still on good terms. We split custody 50/50 for our two kids (6 year old and 4 year old). Being that we moved across country we have no family were I currently reside. 

The last two years since the split has been extremely hard for me. When I was younger I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and this caught up to me to the point where last week I tried to commit suicide, and was hospitalized for a period of time. 

Because of that the ex thinks it's best that I don't have my kids for long periods of time and I find that to be understandable. I can't be there for my kids if my mental health isn't there. 

I have nothing in in this current state besides my kids. I have a good job but no friends or anything else really going for me. 
No support besides me, myself, and I. 

The ex believes that I should move back 'home' where I have family and friends, just an all-around better support, which would be true; but I would be leaving my kids behind. 

She wasn't saying that I wouldn't ever get to see them again just that I need to focus on myself. 

I'm so conflicted on what to do. I don't want to leave my kids as I feel like I would be abandoning them; but I'm so unhappy that all I do is work and come home. I'm scared that if something doesn't change soon that I won't be able to make it.

How to get 3 year old to stop crying all the time?,"Sorry this is kinda long. 

**TLDR:** My three year old cries literally all the time. If she’s not crying she’s whining. It’s gotten to the point where nothing I do helps the crying stop. Sometimes it’s random and for no reason. Other times there are very minor reasons. 

Ex: She drops her pudding cup and starts crying and screaming. I don’t scold her or anything and immediately get her a new one but she still cries! Even ten minutes after I get her a new one, she cries. I try reassuring her and hold her but that does not work at all. 

Ex: When she wants something, sometimes she will communicate what she wants but most of the time she will just throw herself on the floor and cry. 

Ex: She drops her toy and starts crying. I immediately pick it up and hand it back to her yet she still cries. 

These are only some examples but besides this, she cries non stop. About nothing at all. Or atleast I think it’s nothing. She’s not in pain or hungry or anything like that. 

This is my first kid so I don’t know if this is normal three year old behavior. Please help me!",parenting

"Am I overreacting to something my 3 year old said, by assuming sexual abuse?","Basically my 3 year old son repeated 3 times in quick succession the phrase ""Maisie (my dog) loves me, but don't tell Mummy"" in a whispered voice while giving my dog a hug.

I know it is probably nothing, he is at that age where he is starting to get his communication together and will potentially just say odd things, while meaning to say another. It is just not sitting right with me though and I'm struggling to sleep because of it.

I'll provide some further information below as to why I may not be able to respond to some answers of replies.

Me and his Mother are separated, I'll save the details as it is a long story and I don't need validation of who was at fault, but we basically do not speak (by her choice) and only commune in regards to the child. I have no idea of her living, working or relationship status and likewise her of mine.

She will often inform me of concerns or worries she has when he is with me and advise of any medical changes, but if I try to make any suggestions to her she takes it as a criticism of her parenting and we have a massive argument.

I feel I need to say something about this so she can watch out for any odd behaviour, especially around other people. I know it will lead to an argument, but that does not worry me, I do not however want to cause any unnecessary worry to his Mother.

Some other little things that stick out in my mind now are that he started playing really aggressive with his toys a few months ago and he did used to have a serious problem around the age of two with getting changed (as in he would cry and throw a tantrum), but he did grow out of that.

Cigarette-smoking grandpa,"My dad is a lifelong smoker and has a long history being really flippant about cigarette smoke in relation to my son (7). A few years ago I found out he was smoking with my son in the car, and I flipped out. His response was that he “always holds it out the window” to keep the smoke out. Yeeeah. He vowed to never do it again and I trust that he hasn’t. My son would rat on him if he did. 

But... his house. He smokes everywhere and it reeks. He’ll smoke in the kitchen with the range fan on and seriously thinks that completely eliminates the smoke. Again, yeeeah. 

I’ve complained about how my son used to come home smelling like cigarettes. I’d have to give him a bath and wash everything in his suitcase. He insisted that he never smoked in the house while he was there, and the smell must have been from being on the couch, etc. I do believe that he wouldn’t smoke right in front of him, but I think he’s doing the range fan thing while he’s there, especially during the winter when it wouldn’t be enjoyable to go outside to smoke. 

Obviously secondhand smoke is a huge issue and I’ve read a lot, from reputable sources, about thirdhand smoke and how even *that* can be very harmful. I’ve discussed this with my dad because I also have a baby, and he has no qualms with smoking and then immediately touching/kissing the baby, or trying to hold her against his shirt. I sent him an article about THS and he didn’t dispute it. I don’t ever want to take the baby there and I’m afraid to tell him. 

My dad and stepmom absolutely adore my son. They *live* for him. And my son loves being over there. I’m grateful for that and I‘m sure it would hurt my dad if I told him I don’t want him staying there, but I feel like it’s what I need to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A bit personal, but, just putting this out there.  I am 22 years old, and I am currently studying a BsC degree in Audio Engineering &amp; Production. My girlfriend of a long time found out she was pregnant four months ago. At first, the fear and the panic and terror triggered my anxious traits real bad, and I went through a period of time where I felt very confused, about everything. But I quickly came around, and starting focussing my thoughts onto my old childhood and (without waxing into it too much) the fact that my dad, although there in person only sometimes, was never there in heart and always held his own interests more closely. I realised this fact had meant that I automatically feel swayed towards doing the opposite, satisfying for my own what I never received from my own dad and always yearned for watching other kids. 

 This is the thought that made me say to myself, dude, you have to commit your efforts 110% towards this baby no matter what your circumstances are. And I instantly clicked, my brain chemistry almost felt malleable, like it was morphing and changing, and it sounds cheesy in a way but it definitely felt like one of those important transition moments. I knew I was going to be a proper Father, not just a dad who is barely present and doesn't put in the time to establish a connection with their child. I keep picturing, even still, all those precious moments I cannot wait to share with my kid, and through the ups and downs I am so excited to try and influence this person and mould them into a decent, caring human who has compassion for others and holds good values. 

I do still have major anxieties, like will my income suffice when raising a child (*FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN MY FINANCIAL SITUATION* £8995 student loan per year PLUS between £6-900 per month, plus I have saved £1500 for when my child is born). Also, even though I am a hard worker, I don't have any problem committing as much time as I can to anything, I also worry whether completing my degree is going to be feasible whilst supporting a child, which mine will be 3 years old by the time I complete my degree. I also worry about gaining employment in my chosen industry whilst being a parent, as I come from a working class background and everyone else I know seems to take a pessimistic perspective every time I seek advice, I always hear ""Oh that's it for you now"" or ""you'll have to work to the bone you'll have no life"" etc. etc. Please bare in mind, I am not a partygoer, I'm past all that, I do not go on lavish nights out drinking, I'd much rather commit that money towards living. Can I still succeed in what I am passionate about and raise a child?

Bottom line, I'm a 22 year old student, and my life has only just BEGUN, it is definitely not over, I am going to be a father to a beautiful child, and I swear I'll make sure this child has a fruitful life, and feels fulfilled and trusting in BOTH of his/her parents.  Thanks to anyone who bothered to read this, and also really sorry for being so personal, I just felt I had to get this out there to some folks.  To my son/daughter, I cannot wait to meet you and I promise you, I'll always be there x",parenting

I just found out my daughter draws A LOT of porn and I don't know what to do. [NSFW],"I'm a father to a 20 year old artist. She loves drawing characters and comics and is honestly really amazing at it. She already has a following online for her stuff but she doesn't like showing off her stuff at home. Whenever I ask to go through her drawing book she hesitates and I didn't understand why until today.

She was out of the house on a shopping trip, and I was looking for a charge cord in her room when I saw one of her current sketchbooks on her desk. Normally I don't snoop but my curiousity was killing me. I opened the book and to my surprise I found some pretty hardcore porn sprinkled in. It was basically lots of bondage and gay men. In fact these scenes were a good majority of the book, and was in a totally different style from what she normally draws (more realistic than her cartoony style.)

Honestly, I was so taken aback by this and still can't imagine my daughter drawing stuff so... sexual. She seems so innocent on the outside. she dresses conservatively and doesn't even date. I thought I didn't have to worry about her.

Should I do something about this? I feel like I should confront her, and ask her why she thinks it's okay to draw stuff like that. I'm afraid she's going to start acting that stuff out and go down a road of no return.",parenting
11.5 y/o daughter wetting the bed,"Hello. My 11.5 year old daughter has semi-recently begun wetting her bed.   I’d say that this started about a year ago and occurs roughly 3 times a month. She is a very deep sleeper, sleeping through multiple alarms in the morning, and even needing to be roused roughly  from sleep sometimes. Her bedroom is on the third floor of our house and the closest bathroom is on the second floor. She has been living in this room for about 3 years. Prior to this she has never had a problem wetting the bed or having any accidents at all. Potty training was quick and easy. She never wets the bed at sleepovers or if she has someone sleep over.

I actually thought this had stopped but she recently confessed that it has been occurring 2-3 times a month and she’s been hiding it.

Potty-trained 3yr old who refuses to use the potty for NO REASON AND I AM LOSING MY MIND,"Hi smart people of reddit, I'm new to this sub but I'm hoping someone has some great advice for me.

My son will be three in a few weeks. He has been potty-trained for about 4 months. At first the potty-training went well, and he was telling us when he needed to go pee pretty reliably. But he gradually stopped doing that, and it has turned into a battle of wills. As I write this, he just peed in his pants after refusing to go for 6 hours -- and my husband, who normally NEVER loses his cool, was FURIOUS at him. We are both at our wits' end.

I feel like we've tried everything for a few days each -- positive reinforcement for going (stickers, etc), we've tried reminding him frequently (he always insists he doesn't have to go), we've tried having a routine (for example, we always pee when we get up! We always pee before we leave the house!) etc. We've tried putting him in big-kid underwear and letting him be in charge of it. Nothing seems to make any difference.  We've tried patiently reminding him that it's the next thing, and we won't proceed with fun activity X until he goes pee. He never admits he has to go, and he never goes of his own accord. At times he has sat quietly in his room for half an hour or more while we all wait for him to go so we can leave the house.

He goes pretty reliably at daycare, but they have to really talk him into it there too -- they've complained to us about it before. He doesn't have accidents there and wears underwear during the day (Just switched from pull-ups to underwear on their recommendation) At home he usually wears underwear during the day as well, and cloth (washable) pull-ups at night. We made a big deal of the special Paw Patrol underwear and how he needed to keep them dry, and at first it seemed to make a real impact on him but now he doesn't care.

He's not afraid of the potty. He uses sometimes a little potty in the bathroom and sometimes a potty seat on the big toilet. He also sometimes pees standing up. None of these are enticements, it's the same response to everything.

Also, when we were out about about he used to use public bathrooms relatively peacefully but now it's the same thing wherever we go -- he never admits he needs to go.

I'm worried that at this point it's a power struggle and he's doing it just to be difficult -- he's being really obstinate about lots of things lately (tantrums about everything). Plus all of us have been sick for WEEKS which doesn't help; our sleep is all messed up, he's being picky about food etc. etc. None of it good. But this is extra-frustrating because he used to do it and he stopped for no reason. Also the refusing the pee is all the time , and has been gradually getting worse for a couple months -- even when he's in an otherwise good mood, and before he was sick, it was the same problem.

How do you cope with controlling grandparents?,"my mom and step dad are some of the best people i know. but they never listen to me. i’m almost 20. i have a 10 month old. my boyfriend, my baby, and i live with my mom , step dad, and 2 sisters. we’re doing this because i can’t afford daycare and somewhere to live. so we’re saving up to move out.

I appreciate it so much because i know my mom doesn’t have to do anything for me. however she never listens to anything i say and treats me like i’m twelve. she told me i can’t do BLW because it’s the lazy way to feed a baby. and she argues with me with the car seat because she puts my baby in the center and uses the anchors from the sides (which is called borrowing and not allowed) and says she’s raised 3 kids so she knows what she’s doing. when i try to present facts she doesn’t listen to me whatsoever. 

i don’t know what to do anymore. i love my mom to death but i hate how she still thinks of me as a child.",parenting
"Son crushed, left out of neighborhood party:(","My husband and I are in a neighborhood where there are several families with kids the same age as our son. These families are very similar to each other, have the same interests, etc. while we are different and have different interests. While we've tried to reach out and be friendly for the sake of our son, we are included once in a while but not regularly. This is not a big issue for us as we have other friends.

The problem is that our son is friends with these kids and when the families get together every weekend he feels awful that he's not included. Today, one of the boys actually called my son and invited him over, my son heard all of his friends playing over there and he got excited. However, when I reminded the boy to ask his parents, he did and then told my son they said he couldn't invite people over who weren't invited. My son was crushed. We explained how we are not good friends with these other neighborhood families so we won't be invited as much and that it has nothing to do with him. I think he felt better but it still broke my heart for him. I wish they could have included him but they didn't.:(

My [29M] and ex [30F] have messed up my oldest daughters natural sleep,"Background: I am a step father to two girls and their mother and I are no longer together. I am the only father figure they have ever had, I have been in the oldest (8yo) life for 6+ years. 

My oldest has ADHD and other behavioral problems due to her biological father only contacting when it’s convenient for him. Because of her being so hyperactive my ex decided to start giving her melatonin about two years ago. Started with 5mg and it worked very well for a short time. Once her body got use to it my ex decided to go to 10mg and it started working for a short time again. Every time my daughter would get use to the new dosage my ex would bump it up. 

I finally had to step in and say something when 40mg of melatonin wasn’t doing anything to my 7yo daughter. It caused an argument with it ending in her saying that since she’s her mother, she will decide what is good and bad for her. I couldn’t do anything more since I am just the step father. 

Fast forward a few months and my ex takes my oldest to a doctors appointment to see if there is some sort of sleep aid since melatonin no longer has an effect. The doctors prescribed a low dose clonidine and has been taking it for the past year. 

Fast forward to last night...I have my girls for the weekend (typical every other weekend visit) and my ex tells me she forgot to pick up my daughters prescription. After some words I tell her that I’m sure it won’t be a big deal and that I’ll figure it out. So come bed time, get my girls ready and put on a movie. My youngest is sleeping within minutes while my oldest is still wide awake. We watch the movie and she asks me to put another one on. I told her I would but she needs to close her eyes and lay down.

I fall asleep and am woken up at about midnight to her watching videos on her iPad. I tell her she needs to put it away and go to bed. She tells me she’s been trying but just can’t. I read her a book and rub her back to try and help relax her. We counted sheep, I put on sleepy time noises, nothing was working. Her body finally shut down and she fell asleep at 5am and only slept 4-5 hours. She tried taking a nap but was just restless. You can see the physical and mental fatigue it is having on her. 

She has gotten so use to sleep aids that her body doesn’t know how to naturally put it self to sleep any more. I fear this will have a developmental negative on her life as she is hitting an age where her brain needs all the sleep it can get. I am hoping this can be reversed.",parenting
Would you call the police on other children?,"Throwaway

A few minutes ago, my 11-year-old came back from seeing if a friend could play to tell me that the boy's brothers (8ish and 12ish) threatened to get a gun and shoot her if she didn't leave. I'm torn on calling the police because:

1) these kids are already constantly in contact with the police. The boy my daughter went to see is the only one of like, 7 kids that hasn't been in trouble with the law. The parents have had their kids removed a couple different times but they keep getting them back and let them run around town, stealing bikes and toys (and even the parent's own cars), and nothing has really been done about it.

2) This isn't the first time they've threatened other kids, and it won't be the last.

3) They live 2 blocks away and we see them all the time. I don't want to have to deal with any retribution because they'll be mad that I called the police.

Buuuuuuuut, they DID threaten my daughter. I don't know if they even own a gun or if they were just being little jerks, but I'm very upset about it and my daughter is pretty scared. I don't know what to do.",parenting

Please tell me your thoughts on this,"My husband and I went out to see a movie and left my 3 year old with my mom. Towards the end of the movie my husband got an alert on his phone from the doorbell nest cam. He always checks on it so he saw my mom leaving to her car across the street to put something in her trunk. My 3 year old shortly came after her and crossed the street, alone. They both walked back after a couple cars went by. Understandably, my husband was very angry about this and we both decided not to go out for dinner and went straight home to talk to my mom. He confronted her and her response was “how did you see it”. English is her second language so I can see how it might be difficult for her to understand. She initially thought he said he was alerted by someone, and was very shocked. I’m still not sure she fully understands but he told her we have cameras so I think she gets it. We were both expecting an apology but didn’t get one, but I’m wondering if she was too shocked by the idea of being alerted by someone that she did something wrong, and maybe if I had tried to appease her she would have apologized.  

I didn’t say anything because I’ve had too many conflicts with her in the past and for once wanted it to be clear that I am not the only one who is having an issue with her. She has never before put my daughter in any danger like that, so I understand the sudden confrontation that my husband had and would understand if he doesn’t want her to watch my daughter again. I am just wondering if this would be a deal breaker for everyone, or if this should be seen as a mistake that one can move on from.",parenting

When parenting books don't give the promised result,"So this is part rant, and part tip for other parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many of us parents usually read a parenting book of some kind. Of read blog, websites and forums like this one. There's load of tips on how to raise your kid, weather through tantrums, how to talk to your kid, how to listen, how to get them to cooperate and so on. 

Now be honest, often you read something about a certain approach that should have a certain result, and you try it and...kid still does whatever it always does. Well, you know it takes some time to sink in right? So you keep trying for a few days, a few weeks, but no change. And you kind of start to wonder if that advice actually works. 

Let me give an example of my own life. I have this book 'how to talk to kids so they'll listen'. It contains a lot of little comics of examples how to handle situations with kids. One of these is a kid who wants cheese on his bread, but you're outta cheese. The 'good' comic has the mom empathise 'Yes, you really wanted cheese huh? I too wish I had a great wheel of cheese for you!' And at that point the kid smiles and decides on something else for his sandwich because he felt heard and validated. 

Reality! 

Kid: I want cheese but there's no cheese! 

Me: I understand, and I really wish I had some cheese for you. 

Kid: Get cheese now! 

Me: \*smile\* If I could I would conjure a big wheel of cheese for you! I know you want it.

Kid: I don't care the shop is closed GET CHEESE NOW! \*tantrum ensues\* 

Me: \*silently curses that happy mom and kid from the comic\* 

. 

Example 2! 

The comic version; The kid doesn't want to put on his shoes. The mom offers the choice to put on the red or the blue ones. Or a choice to put them on at the table or on the couch. Kid makes a choice and puts on shoes, because choices empower the kid! 

Reality: I offer the kid choices on which shoes to put on, and where to do it. Kid throws tantrum and throws shoes into the living room, and scream 'I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THEM ON!' 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been many moments that I felt lied to by those books. I know I shouldn't expect instant results, and not even quick results, but it's disheartening when after months of trying there seems to be little result. It's often made worse because such books have little real stories from people who followed the training/book/whatever, and had some great quick aha! moment with their kid where things started going better. 

&amp;#x200B;

So fellow parents; this stuff takes months and years to sink in. It just sucks. Generally. the results are worth it though. But in the trenches, it's hard and you often feel like giving up on certain methods. But the methods which focus on empathy (and of course, clear rules, which should be the focus on any parental style) do give results. Just takes about 1-2 years. And yeah, the fact that the empathy is kinda a one way street for most of the time when kids are quite young doesn't help. Just hang in there.",parenting
How do I get my son's stolen bike back?,"We called the police and they went to the apartment that my daughter saw a kid riding my son's bike, no one answered.

So police aside, cause there is only so much they can do, how can I catch this kid and my son's bike and how do I handle it?

My daughter said she saw a kid riding what she described as his bike this morning. I ran around the complex looking and then I see a kid exit his apartment walking away acting suspicious, my daughters description matches this kid, the police went over but nothing. The kid was 7 or 8, i'm hoping his parents are decent and yell at him and just return it. But what if they don't? Should I go to said apartment and just lay it all out being respectful. I figure he is just gonna try and keep it and ride is incognito, and not try to pawn it. But that is a possibility if the parents are POS.

11 year old daughter lying,"Throwaway because this is an embarrassing situation.

Over these past few weeks, my 11 year old daughter has started lying a lot. She has been dealing with some bullying since the beginning of the school year, so I think that's what caused this lying. But lying is always unacceptable in my eyes. The things she has been lying about are chores and homework. For example, I might know she hasn't done her chores even when she said she has. She will continue to lie about it, even when I tell her that I know the truth. She attributes this lying to the stress from her bullying, but then, her bullying stories have escalated in a way the school says they haven't, so I don't even know if I can trust her on the bullying stories. We have never lied around her and have always emphasized the importance of honesty. Before this, she was really honest and almost NEVER lied. But now she is constantly lying.

Parenting after a parent's death,"In a short time - weeks or days - I'll be a widow. My husband is dying of late-stage cancer.

Although it's all terrible, one of the most difficult parts is the prospect of raising our 2.5 year-old alone. I'm terrified. My own father died suddenly when I was 10 and it catapulted me into years of depression and unhappiness. I don't want my little boy to go through something similar, and feel guilty for bringing him into a world where his early experiences will be hard.

Is anyone else in a similar situation? Any reassuring stories from someone who lost a father (or parent) at a very young age, but had an enjoyable childhood? Do you have practical tips, or know of websites or places that offer really good advice? I've browsed and googled all the general Talking-to-kids-about-cancer sites, and I know that therapy, for me and/or at some point him would be a good idea. I've also read that a kid's outcomes in these circumstances depend very much on their mother's mental health. But I'm worried the evenings will be so quiet with just the two of us and that he will miss his dad. And I just feel so fearful and guilty, as well as heartbroken.

Thanks, in advance!

Am I the reason my son isn't talking,"Hey all

So my son is turning 1 in 2 weeks and he isn't talking or babbling like he used to. I know he can talk because at 7 months he was saying Dada and ma but in the past few months he just stopped. 

My fiancee blames it on him watching YouTube but I try to limit his tv viewing to only in the morning when I'm getting ready and in the evening when we get home and I need to get stuff out the car. And he only watches cocomelon because I don't really know nursery rhymes to sing to him. 

I know that television at his age isn't recommended but it's hard to calmly get dressed or do anything when he is screaming. And he will scream for an hour straight if u let him because I did tried the ""no tv"" method before and I found the screaming unbearable. 

Sometimes when the videos play he is sitting quietly in his playpen playing with his toys and other times he s dancing to the songs. 

Him viewing videos isn't a new trend. He has been doing this since he was 6 months but now that he is turning 1 and he hasn't hit his speech milestone in starting to wonder if this is just his developmental speed or is it something I am doing. He is hitting his gross and fine motor developmental milestones but this is delayed. Should I be worried?",parenting
Issues with co parenting,"Hello just looking for some Input and neutrality. So I have a daughter that just turned 1 year old. Me and her mother have had a lot of issues through this first year allot of up and downs. But we trying to work through it and be great co parents (without court). So I have a feeling that she thinks because she’s the mother she hold more weight and say when it comes to our daughter and it’s what she says go. I have been bent and contorted trying to work things out but I end up getting the short end of the stick most of the time. Anyway as of right now my daughter comes over on Tuesday’s and Thursday but can’t spend the night at my house. I have everything my daughter needs, but her mother refuses to let her spend the night. Since she was born she has stayed the night only once. As the father I feel less and feel more of a baby sitter. We got in a argument because we currently as stated above have an agreement about Tuesday and Thursday(which that agreement wasn’t made with me she spoke to my mother because I was actively trying to get my daughter over to my house in the regular so she can spend time with her other side of the family, so the agreement wasn’t even with me it’s between her and my mother). I asked for her on Saturday to bring her to church with me. And she agreed through argument of course, so she’s been coming with me to church on Saturday but she wants her back all the time at 5pm like I have no say. So recently I told her 
“Ok since she’s a year now and you wanted to wait a year. Let’s up the days and nights. Not by much. Since she already comes on Tuesday and go back to you in the evening. How about on Thursday she just stays with me. So I’ll have her Thursday Friday and Saturday morning for church and you get her back.”

She clearly had a issue with this and she said 
“No what I can give you is Friday night, you can continue taking her to church but have to bring her back on Saturday after Church but imma take Thursday from you and your family” 

Clearly I got super upset and stated that she can’t do that. Why would you wanna take away days instead of trying to add days that she can spend time with her father and grandparents. Am I asking for too much? I think I been tolerating this kind of treatment for way too long. And she is making it personal. Am I wrong for being upset and trying to get a few more days and nights with my daughter???",parenting
Who is right about feeding our daughter?,"So I am looking for insight from other parents who may have been in similar situations with an infant or newborn. 

Our daughter graced this world with her presence about 8 weeks ago. Outside of not wanting to get rid of some lung fluid initially, she was super healthy and everything was great. Came home at 6 lbs 8 oz

My fiancée wanted to breastfeed. Which was great at first until the baby started to just NOT like the boob. Left boob is a hard no, right boob was okay sometimes, other times was an on off on off for hours. Doctor said it’s okay to pump and switch to a bottle, so we did. She still takes the boob occasionally but she prefers the bottle

Now here’s the current situation. Doctor gave us a chart showing how much she should be eating at what age. At 6 weeks, she should be around 2oz and be full. But that is not the case. Fiancées first daughter was formula only, would eat 2.5oz and pass out. This baby, not so much. Eat, spit it out, eat, doze off for a few minutes then wake up and want to still eat. At her 6 week checkup, I brought up to the doctor that 2oz isn’t enough for her. She can eat sometimes 3 and still be hungry. He says that 3 is the max, she should be eating it all and then falling asleep. He gave us another sheet to show us how to tell when the baby is hungry. 

Fine. I took the chart. She’s showing every. Single. Sign. Listed. All of them. She can eat 3 oz and show me every sign of still being hungry. But fiancée says we should try to listen to the doctor. So we tried it. And she would wake up, get her 2.5oz and then fuss and cry and squirm and cry for like an hour or so until she fell back asleep. For maybe 30 minutes and then would be on and off the boob until she was actually full. 

I was on complete dad duty one day as my fiancée was out with her mother. Baby was hungry. I put 3oz in the bottle. She downs it. She is still showing me signs that she is hungry. So I decided to make another 2oz bottle and see how that works instead of this whole fight and fuss and cry battle we have been doing. 

She ate another 1.5oz and was knocked out. Happy as a clam. Showed the signs that she was done eating, so I didn’t force her and I let her fall asleep. Fiancée came home and said “did you have a lot of trouble getting her to sleep?”  Said “nope, I just fed her more”

Now cue the debate as to whether I’m harming her by over feeding her and yada yada yada. Convinced fiancée to give it a shot later in the day and now she’s slowly coming around but still unsure of whether we should be “feeding her so much”

I just want to know, am I wrong?  Am I wrong for not listening to the doctors chart?  I have a baby who is clearly showing me she is hungry, why should I not be feeding her?",parenting
Best cars for family of 5?,"Due in January with #3 and I drive a Honda Element (fits 4...baby would have to be in the front seat). I think it’s legal if I disable air bags but probably a different vehicle is safer.

Under pressure for a 2nd baby,"So I’m in a little pickle with my marriage and could do with some advice from fellow parents here. 

The short story: My wife and I have a wonderful 3 year old boy who is the without a doubt, the best thing I have ever created. My wife desperately wants a second child, I desperately don’t. 

The long story: My wife is almost 38 and time is ticking for her. I said from the start that I only wanted one child. She was always non committal on numbers. 

I desperately don’t want a second child. I earn 3/4 of the family income and am already stretched. We both have our own businesses, significant responsibility and I don’t want the financial commitment, time commitment, stress and responsibility for bringing another human into the world. 

Sadly, my wife’s mother died shortly after our Son’s first birthday. The grief took a huge toll on my wife for a significant period of time and I struggled to understand or manage to be able to care for her and understand her emotional needs (a compounding factor here is that I have relatively mild Asperger’s syndrome). This meant that she now feels she has missed out on being emotionally there to enjoy our son’s early months and 1st couple of years and feels that she has missed out and wants to do it all again. She describes her want for a second child as a desperate need that comes from deep inside her that she can’t control. 

Unfortunately, due to us not connecting, we separated for a couple of months about 8 months after her mum died. It was an emotional time for both of us. I drank too much and smoked too much and was a bit of a mess for that period of time. My wife clearly didn’t want to call it quits and we agreed to get back together. At the time my wife made it clear that if we did then a second child would be part of the package. Foolishly, I agreed and I understand that I’m a bit of a jerk for doing so when deep down it wasn’t something I wanted. 

Shortly after, my wife had a miscarriage. I felt like I had dodged a bullet. She felt she had lost everything. 

Then after that, due to my health issues, I had to go onto HRT and in doing so lost my fertility to the extent that we would have to spend tens of thousands for IVF+ICSI to have another child. All in the meantime, I am thinking that I desperately don’t want. 

So we’re at a bit of a stalemate. We are having counselling but haven’t fixed anything yet. It seems as if there are really 3 possible outcomes: 

1. We divorce and I lose being there for my son every night and morning. 
2. We stay together and have another baby for which I take on the extra stress, pressure, financial commitment and end up resentful. 
3. We stay together and don’t have the child for which she is resentful.

"Child wants to major in something widely considered ""useless"" and I don't know what our next steps should be.","We have 3 kids. The oldest is a sophomore at a elite public university majoring in a STEM field. The next two are twin seniors in high school. Boy Twin has a short list of schools he would be happy at and plans on majoring in business/econ while competing on an intercollegiate sports team. He also considered elementaty education and I think he might end up going back to that but the first year is mostly getting required courses out of the way and plenty of college students change majors, so I am not too concerned about him. 

Girl Twin wants to go to a non-traditional college. Think along the lines of a music, art, or theater school. The one she hopes to attend is considered one of the best in the nation but she would still end up with a degree most people regard as useless and unemployable. 

We are paying for our kids college tuition and plan to move to Australia (we live in the US but my wife is from Australia) once the kids graduate so the idea of spending money on a degree that will make my child hard to employee is scary, especially since the older one wants to pursue a bio PhD and if Boy Twin sticks with business he'll want to get his MBA. The oldest is also looking at off campus housing for junior year and we wil be contributing to that.

I’m a younger mom and I feel like I can’t relate to anyone...,"I’m not a super young mom, just younger than average. I’m 26 and my daughter is 19 months old. But I’m the first person in my friends group to have a kid. 

It’s hard to relate to both other moms and also my friends. I love my Mom Facebook group, but the majority of them are older, and most are planning/trying for a second or third kid, and I have no interest in that yet. And they all seem so content just staying in most nights with their kids. A few nights a week, I’ll come home from work, spend some time with my daughter, and then head out again to get some drinks with my friends or something.

On the other hand, my friends my age don’t realize that I can’t up and go out every single night of the week. They’re always asking if I want to go to the bar late at night, and get super drunk, and just crash on their sofa for the night. My one friend was annoyed with me because I couldn’t make a last minute trip with her to visit another friend, because I had no one to watch my daughter. It’s like they forget I have a kid, and that while I like going out with them, I can’t just get wasted like they can. If they’re hungover, they can just sleep it off and chill all day, while I have a toddler to take care of at home, and doing that while hungover totally sucks. Also, I need to spend some time with my husband too.

Advice for nurturing my Daughter's musical talent?,"Hi there, this is my first post. Normally I feel I have everything 'figured out', but i'm a bit stumped on this one. 

My daughter (8) has recently started taking Piano lessons. She is Autistic, normally quite shy, introverted and feels anxious easily. The teacher has spoken to my Wife about how she's doing and he basically said ""she's gifted"". She's learning a lot faster than most kids do per lesson, and he's having a bit of trouble keeping up with how fast she's learning the materials. We have a keyboard at home which she's been practicing on, but neither me or my wife are particularly knowledgeable or talented when it comes to music. 

The fact she's autistic is something we need to consider. She loves music, but she gets stressed and anxious easily. I'm asking on advice from other parents, perhaps those who also have anxious or autistic kids, how the best way to approach nurturing her talent without stressing her out?

I have to tell my son his cat died when he wakes up,"We've had this cat for almost as long as my son's been alive. His name was Mac - he was a fluffy white thing who was weird and loving and gentle. He went missing on Tuesday, and we found him Wednesday night very clearly not well. Took him to the vet Thursday, and all his bloodwork came back clean. They gave him fluids, antibiotics, and a steroid for the wheezing he was starting to have.

He never really got better. My wife had hope yesterday - she was giving him food and water with a syringe, but when I got home from work yesterday evening I knew it was basically over.

He passed this morning at around 4am.

Now I'm dreading my son waking up and asking how Mac is. He's 8. We're not a religious family - in fact, we're pretty much pure atheist. So there will be no talk of afterlives or rainbow bridges.

But this is going to break his heart.",parenting
I feel bad for taking my coughing kid to the park,"My daughter is a daycare kid and gets a little cold, runny nose, cough etc. quite frequently. The coughs seem to last forever though after the rest of the symptoms clear up, and while she might seem sick to others she is absolutely fine, super bright, active, eating, acting completely normal.

She had one of these mild little colds start up a few weeks ago, and for two weeks I kept her home from her usual activities outside of daycare (library craft and dancing), because I obviously didn't want her getting too close to any of the other kids.

Yesterday we ventured to the park, and of course the first thing she did was cough near a little girl, probably a year or so younger than her. The mother freaked right out, almost knocked over my daughter to grab hers, yelled ""my daughter has a compromised immunity!"" and gave me a huge glare. And then stormed off.

And I'm honestly not mad! I get the mother's concern, I really do. And I kind of feel really guilty about her getting too close to another kid, but in all honesty I forgot about the cough. Whoops.

I know other people take their kids out when they are sick (or seem sick). I just feel bad and haven't stopped thinking about the mum's reaction and had to write this down lol. Feeling a bit like a jerk mum 🤷‍♀️",parenting
Staying at family hotel with sick child,"Need some advice here: we are at a family hotel for the first time with all inclusive.

Preschool nap time/anxiety issues?,"My 4 year old goes to a private daycare/preschool. They have one to two hours of nap time a day. My son does not need a nap. If he takes one, he will not fall asleep at night until 9:30-10. If he doesn't take one he falls asleep pretty well around 8:30 which is an acceptable time, but he gets in trouble at daycare because he can't lay quietly for two hours. He is a super social kid and he has a lot of anxiety about keeping to himself for too long. I realize that this is something that's not perfect and we work on it, but he can't be expected to be ""fixed"" over night. 

Today when I picked him up he was upset. He didn't behave adequately at nap time so he wasn't allowed to have cake or participate in a classmate's birthday. I understand that bad behavior should have consequences, but the feeling of being left out of someone's birthday party really compounded things for him. When we got home he barfed on the floor. I can't be sure it was because of him being so upset but he didn't seem otherwise ill. I felt pretty bad for the guy. 

The most annoying part to me is that his teachers always say his day was fine and never bring up behavior issues to us. We hear about his punishments from him and he has a hard time articulating what behavior brought them on. When asked teachers seem to brush it off as not a big deal. He's not a perfect kid but he always means well and most of his getting in trouble stems from his strong desire to interact and be with people. 

I just feel like I have exhausted my advice to my son for getting over this nap time behavior and I don't know what to ask of daycare to make it so he's not constantly getting into trouble over nap time. I don't want to set him up to feel like he's ""the bad kid.""",parenting
"Son (almost 4) will dance around holding his penis yet tell me he doesn't to pee 🤔🤨 Refuses to use toilet until the very last minute. If any y'all have dealt with this, please tell me your secrets.","My son, let's call him Dr No Tinkle, only started toilet training 4-5 months ago so it's still fairly new. I believe the reasons Dr No Tinkle doesn't want to go is because he doesn't like to wash his hands, would prefer not to stop doing whatever is engaging him and also wants to be in control of when he goes.

It's not really a big problem for me because he rarely wets himself however Dr No Tinkle will become very fidgety and agitated to the point where he won't be able to sit still. It's not nice for Dr No Tinkle and can be irritating if he is having dinner or just behaving badly because he's feeling uncomfortable.

So I've tried:

1. We do ""special"" wees where mummy does all the work so Dr No Tinkle doesn't need to wash his hands. I know, I know it's not a great solution but I figured if it made him more willing to pee then I would slowly encourage hand washing again with fun soaps etc. This strategy helps sometimes

2. I've tried to not say anything so that he feels more in control. Or if I do say something it will be more of an observation like ""you're grabbing yourself and can't sit still, maybe you need to pee. You'll feel better if you do"".

3. I've tried explaining why he has that feeling to pee-""your wee is in a big sack called a bladder and when it's full your body tells you it's time to empty it by weeing""

The only way I can get him to pee sometimes is to tell him he is going to get a timeout if he doesn't. I know not great but if we are leaving the house then he needs to bloody wee! 

If anyone has any thoughts, advice then Dr No Tinkle and myself would be very grateful :)",parenting
"3 year old meeylts estranged addict ""Father""","I dont know how to edit title.  

I (31F) really help you guys can help because I see him soon.

My son's bio dad (30M) has been in and out of jail of the past 5 years. He has had many opportunities to visit, but he has only met ""our"" son three times in the past 3 years. 

He and I only dated for only 5 months and he was really bad for me. Got me into a lot of drugs. My head was totally out of it.  NO EXCUSE to not use bc, but i would take plan b if he told me there was a chance of...you know. We broke up about a week before I found out I was pregnant. Typical story, he was there for 3 months. Promsed he be the dad he never had. Then completely vanished, moving in with the girl (barely 18) 250 miles away, to the town where he sold drugs (""never shit where you eat""). 

God this is hard to write. Last winter he and his gf started harassing me. After no contact for 6 months, He texted one night till 1AM horrible things. They both were. I was in tears devestated. Personal attacks on my parenting &amp; appearance. It was 100% clear he was on drugs again.  I told him to stop contacting me, that any further communication is harassment. He stopped, gf wouldnt. Calls from blocked #s all night, all day. Police told me they couldn't do anything to prove it was her making the calls. And to change my #. Eventually after calling the police 6 times, i changed it. She has 3 different Instagram accounts I know of. Had to block, but she kept harassing me. Made everything private, but im sure she is stalking the social media of my family. At this point I spoke to Bio we agreed to be civil and only talk about ""our"" son.

She started texting ftom his phone. I didnt report this because he is on probation (parole? I forget which one) and i was NOT going ro be the reason he went to jail (15+ year sentence).

 I didnt want to inteoduce him to my son if he 1) doesnt want to, and 2) is on drugs. 

Since he only came to my house when his mom dragged, i said if he wanted to see my son the would have to set it up, not his mom. This resulted in no one contacting me until he goes to jail agan this spring.

His mom contacted me 6 months ago and we started getting together. I absolutely LOVE his family. They have been so warm and accepting. Similar to my family, they are close. Bio's mom and step dad are amaxing people. It was awkward at first, he lies so much God only knows what he told her. She was wary of me, as well she should! Its one of the reasons I think she makes a awesome grandma. She loves unconditionally and never gives up on the people.

Anyway, son loves them, they love him. His extended family are coming to town, and I am honored and thrilled they want to include my son. Issue- my son will see bio for the first time in a year. He doesnt remeber meeting him, this will basically be the first time.

Bio is going to rehab, then plans to move BACK with his gf, to the SAME place he has been arrested 5 times for serrious drug offenses. 

I wish he wasnt there, but my son shouldn't miss out, its his family too.

Bio's gf is still crazy, now that he is out she is contacting me again by making more social accounts, and found my email. I block and document each time.

Side note- he refuses to admit Theyre together. He calls her a crazy bitch. Im sure he says the same thing about me.

I dont want her around my son ever. Im afriad if we do family stuff with them she'll be there. Per court agreement, im going above and beyond for my son's sake, but him meeting her is a huge line I refuse to cross. Im worried that more leniency on my part is paving the way to family events with the gf.

Should i get a restraining against her? Do i even go there if I know bio will be there? What can i do to lessen the amount of fucking up this will do to my son?

How the fuck do i explain who this is to a three year old?",parenting
How do I get help for PPD if I don’t have insurance?,"I’ve already done therapy before my Medicaid expired. Talking and support groups is not what I need. I’ve tried exercising. It’s not good enough. 

I know where the issue is from, and it’s from the turmoil that the kids father put me through. I just can’t seem to find anything that’ll heal this pain and grief. I’ve already told him how I feel, but it doesn’t help. I’ve tried finding distractions like my therapist recommended at the time, but nothing helps. It is not due to lack of sleep. My soon to be 3 month old sleeps awesome at night. 

I need meds. Theyre my last resort. But I don’t qualify for Medicaid after my pregnancy Medicaid expired. I do a bit of freelancing, but it’s not guaranteed stability at all. It’s only enough to get me by with necessities. I can’t afford paying monthly amounts for insurance, plus copays, meds, etc,

Teenage daughter 101 aka what am I doing wrong?,"Ok. So I am new to reddit. I've never posted before but I've read plenty of other posts. I have a 13 year old daughter. She is very self-aware and has a good head on her shoulders. I am very surprised at this. I always thought I had screwed up her life after her father and I divorced. However, she has proven to be a well adjusted young woman. 
Since she was 8 we have had a code-word system to discuss some high level issues. Ie. Sex, boys, girls, emotions, period, etc. In the past 2 years we have had ""in the vault"" convos. Talks that remain just between us, unless it's very serious. Then I can discuss them with her father. He is very understanding, but will always see her as his baby girl. 
Recently some of our talks have been leading to her sexual orientation.  She looks at herself as being bi. Which is not an issue for me. I am bi as well. She has not talked to her father yet but said she will when the time is right. Then she kinda dropped a bomb on me today...""mom, I have been masturbating."" 
I kinda laughed and said that its perfectly normal to masturbate.  She started sharing details about what she has used. Nothing was appropriate.  So I told her we are going to make a stop at Walgreens on our way home. 
I walked to the aisle with tampons and condoms.  Yes. I bought my daughter her first vibrator.  I actually felt very proud of myself and I even got extra batteries. Lol. I gave her the box and told her about proper etiquette (put a sock on the door and to clean up after). We talked a little more about how men and women orgasm differently. Plus I jokingly showed her the ""Friends"" clip of the seven erogenous zones. She laughed. We hugged and went our separate ways. 
Later, I went to check on her.  I found her asleep in her room. I noticed the box was opened and left on her desk. I said goodnight and I love you. Then I simply smiled and closed her door behind me.

Best baby advice in the universe: earplugs,"Might sound like a joke, but it's not.   


I was reading through some posts and was reminded of how hard it was for me when my kids were babies. Colic. Over-tired crying. Tantrums. I can't remember if I read this somewhere or if I just made it up, but it was as if my kids' crying was pitched at a frequency that went through me like electricity through water.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty early on, I started wearing earplugs, and it was a complete game changer. I could hold a baby who was crying at full volume *for as long as they needed!* With earplugs I was able to keep them right there with me, face-to-face, without getting that frazzled, fried feeling that, at least for me, always made me feel like I was at the end of my rope.   


I guess the most important thing about wearing earplugs was they allowed me to empathize more, even when I was dead tired. I think they just allowed me to be a better parent.

Is it that hard not to get lice???,"Ok fellow reddit parents, my husband often says to ask reddit when we're in disagreement and this time I'm actually doing it. 

His 11 year old daughter,  my stepdaughter, has come to our house with lice in her hair way too many times. 

After one of the times a few months ago, I told my husband he had to check her head before coming in the house each time she comes here from her mom's or school. Already tired of having to wash sheets and everything a billion times and vacuuming like a madwoman constantly trying to prevent it from spreading, I told my husband it had to stop!

Of course, he didn't follow through, and now everyone and everything in our home is infested, again.

At this point, she is a fully functioning, healthy, smart, 11 year old, and I am of the mindset that she should be more than capable of not contracting lice. 

I've told her that she needs to be super careful about sharing hats, scarves, hair stuff etc with her friends yet I've witnessed her sharing headbands with friends and even trying on hats and stuff in stores (I flipped out on her in Goodwill). 

Each time I remind her why and what not to do but alas, here we are yet again......

I think at her age she is old enough to be responsible enough to not get lice! But she says I'm making her feel bad when I tell her she could prevent this, and my husband doesn't hold her responsible at all. 

I'm not shaming or placing blame even,  just asking that she be responsible and not let this keep happening. 

The question for you guys is, is 11 years old old enough to be able to remember to keep stuff away from your hair that could infect you with lice?",parenting

My 6 year old is a hypochondriac,"Every night it’s something new. Her leg hurts. Her head hurts. She has a hangnail. Whatever it is, it’s major and dramatic. I won’t lie, I’ve given her Tylenol or Benadryl as a placebo occasionally. She literally won’t sleep over it. Whatever it may be. 

There’s no convincing her it is simple or no big deal. 

I went to school with a girl (I’m 32 now) that grew up with a mom who was a hypochondriac and she is now.   I see that she got that from her mom, but I am nothing like that. I don’t know where my daughter gets it from.   

I am hyper conscience of my children’s well-being, so if there was ever anything serious, I would totally take action, but my daughter freaks out and has meltdowns over every single thing. She loves being sick. She loves taking medicine. She obsesses over everything with her body, including her loose teeth.

Why oh why won't you take a bottle?,My DS is 5 months old. I returned to work at six weeks and he was taking a bottle well while I was away... Then suddenly he just stopped. He refused every bottle.

"I need help with getting our 21m boy, still breast feeding to sleep. my partner always ends up in his bed during the night, which I'm worried about.","We have always used a sling or pram to get him to sleep, and now we always use this method to get him down for lunch time nap. The main sleep is always mum in bed with him breast feeding, and then cuddling. She will get fed up after and hour or so and call me in. I have a much stricter approach, I will read a story and then turn down the lights. Tell him its sleep time, and lay him down. He constantly fights this, squirming, jumping up and down, giggling, crying, asking for water, for hugs (I always oblige for 2, then stop). The room isn't large, and he as a single bed, I sit next to it, and he rolls around and one leg comes off, then two legs off, body off etc. If he can he will touch me with his limbs. I try to sit on a chair in the room rather than the floor next to the bed, but he will squirm off and run for the door.  


I sing, and then humm songs to him.  


Eventually mum comes back and gets boob out again, and 30mins later he is usually asleep.  


I hate this. It doesn't seem right. I look online and can't find info, it seems most parents at this point are closing the door on their put to bed child while they drift off on their own, this seems miles away for me.  


I believe my partner should end the boob, and although she tells me she is trying, its been at least 6 months of trying. I'm not in gonna tell her what to do, and I do want to support her as much as possible. I think she has a great approach to parenting, which is being warm, playful and very accommodating. Which to me are happy opposites to what I was expecting when I became a dad. I grew up in a world where being firm and expecting respect was the norm. I do prefer the mutual respect and treat little man like a fellow person mindset.

I knew 3 would be hard but it’s hard af and I’m screwing this up.,"I have a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old. My 3yo is polite, compassionate, so smart, and fairly level-headed at school (he goes to preschool twice a week).

My wife and I aren't tiger parents but our daughter behaves like we are. How can we get her to not put so much pressure on herself academically?,"My kids are in high school and attend a highly competitive public school where everyone is focused on getting the best grades possible. It is a blessing and a curse. I love it because I think having a peer group that cares about academics can be a good thing when kids are starting to care more about what their friends think than what their parents think. We tend to be the house that all of the kids friends gather at and both have high achieving friends. My son's friends are mostly athletes but even they put school first. My son seems to have a much better balance than my daughter, though. He is a hard working straight A student who loves school, but he is also involved in sports, student government, and school clubs. He still has free time and likes to just hang out with friends at the park on the weekends or have a group over to chill. 

My sophomore daughter seems to be hyper focused on academics. The school limits kids to one AP sophomore year and my daughter has yet to stop complaining about it. She thinks she could have handled two and is worried about being behind kids at other schools. She is getting ready to take her first PSAT and has been doing SAT prep because she hopes to use this test to prepare for the PSAT next year since juniors with high enough scores can qualify for a national merit scholarship. She she is essentially preparing for a practice test to a practice test. She is someone who likes preparing and being in control. After taking a summer enrichment course, I noticed she seemed a bit down. She said she loved the course but was now annoyed because it may have changed her ideas on what she wants to major in. This was prior to sophomore year of high school. 

I know it may not seem like a huge deal but I am worried about her putting too much pressure on herself and burning out. My wife and I say that she might be the least emotional teen on the planet but she pushes so much down and that concerns me. She isn't the type to really say how she's feeling. She is super serious and moves along until she eventually kind of shuts down. You hear stories about overworked teens that develop severe anxiety and I want to make sure we avoid that. We have suggested mental health days from school but she refuses. She hates missing school for any reason. I even schedule her dentist appointments (she wears braces) for after school because she hates it that much. She does relax sometimes and has other things she enjoys. She plays an instrument for her school orchestra and does robotics and quiz bowl. She has friends over sometimes and spends time online, but almost all of her online time is spent researching something and over last weekend it was a struggle to pull her off the computer for dinner because she fell into a hole while doing honors chem homework. We are thrilled when she walks around with friends playing Pokemon-Go. 

My wife and I both feel like we need to do something but aren't sure what to do. We both value education but have never put that pressure on our kids. We do not punish or reward for grades. Pulling her out of that school isn't really an option and I don't think it would solve our issues. She genuinely loves school and looks forward to it. Our concerns are more about the next two years when school become more stressful. While the school is competitive, they are aware of that and make an effort to decrease stress levels like limiting APs. I do think the school plays a role in this but her personality (stubborn, driven, tendency to become hyper focused) and certain aspects of her life are probably more to blame. I apologize for the length of this post. There is a lot of information on how to motivate kids to do care more about school but I can't find much about doing the opposite.

Edit: Wanted to add that my wife and I have talked to our daughter about our concerns. She brushes it off and says she is fine. She knows that both of us attended public state universities for college and that didn't stop us from going to the graduate/med schools of our choice. I want to be clear that we are not trying to make her into something she is not. Being a nerdy introvert is more than fine (my wife and I both are) but being a stressed out grade student driven by letters on a report card can be an issue. We want to prevent it from becoming one.",parenting
Private school admissions question,"Apologies if a similar question has been asked before. Please direct me to the appropriate thread if yes. If there's a better forum for my question, please direct me to it. Thank you. 

Does anyone know whether a child applying to a private high school the second time (after being wait-listed the first time) has a higher chance of admission this second go 'round? I'm wondering whether, by applying again, the school will view the student as really serious about getting in.",parenting
My kid is the biter,"My dd19m has been biting at daycare. She mostly bites one particular boy and the daycare director says they generally arent playing when she bites. I have noticed at home she will go to bit me if I make her angry, or if I am not paying attention to her. I posed the idea to the daycare director that they might try keeping her busier and since she is starting to string together sentences we will work on a ""play with me"" sentence. I really think this is her way of getting attention from her friends. But she was bitten at this same daycare by a boy when she was an infant, I never made a big deal out of it because toddlers just do this. Of course I didnt like it.  So I feel bad  that my child is biting and it sucks to think that other parent probably envisions my sweet kiddo as a ""biter"". so far we discourage biting, I ignore her if she bites. The daycare teacher is going to work on keeping her busier and helping me teach her to ask to play. Any ideas or even support? I'm sad for my baby who is having trouble communicating.",parenting

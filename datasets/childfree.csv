future mommies get to skip the line !!!,"my new potential workplace - a chain store with decorations, clothes, different home equipment, toys, office supplies,... and etc in my local mall i have gone to last friday to ask for a job, i'm a highschool dropout so i can't be very picky but i'm happy to have done this for my mental and finally got out. me and my mom picked a vase and i got some spooky decorations for my room. we were waiting in line at checkout and there was a large sticker on the cash register - ""FUTURE MOMMIES GET TO SKIP THE LINE !,, with a pregnant chick on it with like 3 people behind her. i couldn't believe it at first. i have been a part of this commity for a while and feel so great about embracing how i feel. however my first thoughts when i saw the sticker were 

- wow, like noone else could be in a rush.

- why do they get to skip the f-ing line ? like she could randomly go into labour any f second so she has to rush constantly ??? 

- what a way to scratch a mombie's ego in yet another way. 

- maybe i would like her to be gone asap cuz pregnant women with their bigass bloated stomachs gross me out  

just felt like a small story like this belongs here. i still hope i'll get this job tho.",childfree
Getting a vasectomy in the UK (M21),"Hi all,

Sorry for the upfront post but I've lurked on here for quite a while with a few posts (Really love the community and mindset).

I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this as I can't really find much out there.

I am of a strong CF opinion (I have been since I was 15, no issues with kids, accept they exist, have no desire to have them, would not be able to cope if I did, the idea of being a parent makes me very ill) and I was wondering how easy it is to get a vasectomy in the UK (On the NHS or private if necessary)

Has anyone undertaken this or does anyone know of someone who has and if so what are the steps like? Is it an uphill battle or are people relatively understanding on the situation?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, even if it's just jokes about ice and frozen peas :)",childfree
Apparently you only have the right to have your phone on non-silent when you have kids...,"So this happened a few minutes ago:
While having a lecture on artificial intelligence at university, the profs phone started ringing. She stops her presentation to look at it and calmly says: ""Yeah, I am allowed to answer my phone, but you are not."" Playing it off as a joke, the audience laughs hysterically. 
So she continues: ""I have a five year old daughter and sometimes she has a hard time in kindergarten. You may look at your phones aswell, IF you are also a parent."" Sad thing is, she was more serious about it than necessary. 

Dude, what? She acts as if people without children have nothing important going on in their lives. Of course. Without children, who could I possibly be worried about? I must be a hermit without friends or family without kids.

Sorry if my english is not perfect, I'm german but had to share this with someone...",childfree
I see ads for young parents All. The. Time.,"I clicked on the ""why do I see this ad?"" option on Facebook after the n-th time I've seen an ad for families/parents/mothers. It said I see it because I'm a woman between the ages of 20 to 35. I removed ""family"" from my interests (I've never put it there on the first place). A few days later the same ad came up again like nothing happened.

On YouTube I watch no stuff related to family or having kids, and yet many times it puts in ads about this and offers me videos like ""My birth story"" even though I'm tokophobic so I always remove those from my recommended.
I wasn't pissed for the first few times because I know I'm a minority and I have to help Facebook and Google to understand that I'm not interested in kids but after months of clicking and removing they still don't seem to understand.

I want cat related ads. Or dog related. Or anything else than babys, really.

"""If you get pregnant this year, it will improve my son's luck"" – mother in law","My husband and I have been married for less than a year. I’m 32 years old and he’s 36 years old. Both of us are Chinese, being childfree by choice is a touchy subject and It’s expected that once you get married, then you will have a baby. We haven’t been honestly telling the truth to our family that we’re not planning to have a baby. 

My mother has been asking occasionally if we’re planning to have a child, I didn’t really give her an answer, and she has stopped asking me since. As for my mother in law, she’s way more aggressive in pressuring us to have a child. She told me stuff like: we shouldn’t wait and how she would help to take care of the baby. From Chinese New Year to his cousin’s wedding, almost everyone (from his aunts to his married cousins) are asking us about having a child. We would just smile and responded back with a joke. 

A few days ago, my mother in law told me that my sister in law is pregnant with a baby girl. She was disappointed that it's not a boy. So, hoping that she still has a chance to have a grandson, she took that opportunity to (again) pressurized me. She asked me “have you guys been trying?”. I was so stunned that I didn't know how to respond back. then she carried on “you guys shouldn’t wait, the older you get, the harder it will be for you to get pregnant. I can take care of your baby. And the Chinese fortune teller has told me if you get pregnant his year, it will improve my son’s luck”. 

She only brought this up when my husband is not around. ",childfree
"The switch from ""I don't want kids"" to CF","My lack of desire for children is not new. I have said for years that I don't want to have kids ever. However, my permanent decision not to have children and be CF is pretty new. 

I feel like this decision has been pretty monumental and defining. I kind of feel like a new, different person. I feel free and at peace.

I feel guilty for hoping to be infertile..,"Im 20 years old and have never wanted children. I have been on the combination pill since i was 16, and it has been working smoothly until about 3 months ago. I started having extremely painful sex, i start bleeding a few days before i normally get my period (when im still on the active pills), i have mild cramps, im always exhausted, and i have dark brown blood at the beginning of my early periods rather than the light pink that it used to be. 
Anyways, ive been terrified that the reason ive been getting my period early is because i am taking kratom and am afraid that its making my pills less effective. I am absolutely terrified of pregnancy and childbirth and would 100% get an abortion, but funding it would be very difficult. I have been to the doctor twice and he said i should try a new method of birth control, but i really would rather not until other causes are ruled out. I feel awful for saying this and id never publicly annouce it to family, but i secretly hope that im becoming infertile. Has ""god"" finally listened to me? Ive wanted to be sterilized since i was maybe 6 and have known i never wanted kids since my mother traumatized me with birth videos at age 3. I have 3 younger siblings and was not great with them. I could be a violent child, and when they would cry i would get angry and throw things at them, squeeze them, or hit them. I know i would never do that to a baby anymore, but a part of me thinks that was a lesson to show me i would not be a good mother. I dont have patience for babies and dont even like them at all. My aunt continues to pop out baby after baby and is always asking me when im going to have my own. Her marriage is an absolute mess and her kids are brats. They are extreme Christian's and think because i am an athiest that im a bad influence on their precious offspring. 
I have no idea what is going on with me right now, im supposed to hear from an OBGYN within the next few days. I can only hope that this isnt related to my birth control pills and that i will not get pregnant and have to somehow fund an abortion. Is this finally the free sterilization ive been asking for? Maybe...i can only dream..",childfree
Please stop exploiting your sick child on Facebook for monetary gain.,"I have a Facebook friend who has an extremely sick child who has a rare medical condition.

So excited!,"I am thrilled!

End of next week I am jetting off to Japan for the better part of a month! I am staying in hostels - dorms, specifically - which would not be possible with kids; who needs a decent room when you're by yourself? All I need is a place to stash my stuff and a bed, since I won't be spending a lot of time in the hostel. 

And I've booked every theme park and tour under the sun, as well as numerous cafes and pub crawls, and everything is paid for up front! All I need is spending money, which is coming along very nicely.

As for my flights - well, I booked economy and just carry-on, because it's just me and I don't need a lot of luggage. But I just got upgraded to business class thanks to a special offer from the airline!

I honestly don't think this trip could get any better! I guarantee if I had kids I would not be going because it would be too expensive - but now I get to experience all the best parts of Tokyo, including Disneyland and Disneysea! 

I wish I could fit all you lovely people in my carry-on bag!",childfree
I just need to vent a little and this is the only place I can.,"Some context: I am 26F. I like kids, I just don't want my own. I've been single for 1.5 years after my last boyfriend dumped me for not necessarily wanting kids even though I told him that up front.

I hate the fact that, to a man who wants kids, I'll never be enough for him on my own. I'm just the means to have his children, and their built-in caretaker. 

I have known my best (M) friend for years, and I would be happy to spend the rest of my life with him. But of course he wants a child. A natural child. He comes from a very healthy family. I... don't. He doesn't know how mental illness/disability affects a family. His parents are empty-nesters. Mine never will be, my brother has severe emotional issues that are thus far untreatable, and he's 24. 

I simply won't be enough for this guy. He insists that it doesn't matter at this point, but I think things would probably end up like they did for Jan Levinson. Has anyone else successfully dated someone who wanted kids, but later in life? Did they change their mind? I don't think I'll change my mind so I don't expect him to change his.

Picky eating and being childfree,"I’m 22 and have always been picky with food. I’m hesitant to try new things. Very sensitive to food smells. I have particular foods, condiments, etc that I won’t even touch. I probably don’t have the healthiest diet either but eat what I’m comfortable with. One of the things I’m looking forward to most about leaving home (eventually) is having my own fridge without weird stuff that my family like.

I’ve been thinking more and more about the childfree life, and besides the awfulness that is pregnancy, feeding a child as it grows up is already grossing me out. It would obviously be irresponsible and probably negligent to deprive a child of food on the basis of my own food habits but the thought of having to make food and touch certain things that I hate repulses me.. I’ve grown up inadvertently growing these aversions and passing that on to a child seems like a poor decision. To me this one of a couple of strong reasons I’m disinterested in children. I shouldn’t stop them being able to eat certain things but knowing my relationship with food, I feel I’d struggle incredibly to give them things I am repulsed by?

Has anyone else that’s quite picky felt this? I’d love to hear if that was/is a consideration for anyone else!

Hope everyone is having a good day :)

Edit: I rephrased a few things to clarify it was more so food issues I’ve had since childhood, vs just an unhealthy diet.",childfree
Children just dont fit into my plans anymore.,"When I was a teenager and pre teen, I was heavily depressed and suicidal. To combat that, I had a life goal plan:

Age 18: Graduate high school.

Age 22: Graduate college. 

Age 25: Get married. 

Age 30: Have kids for the next couple of years, 2 maybe 3.

Age 65: Retire and be in the lux of leisure for the rest of my life.

Now, when I realized that I wasnt going to college right after HS, I felt so stressed and anxious that I wasn't going to meet my goals. But it was the best thing to happen to me. I took my time. I went to community college and I'm gonna transfer to a university next year, get my BA in 2 years and then head off to grad school for another 2 years. My plans have now completely changed. I'm a completely different person, after I realized that my original plan was what other people wanted from me. Kids are now off the board. I've met the love of my life and we've been together for almost 2 years. We plan on getting married but we both want to be stable for each other. I will have to pay for my own education. And above all, I no longer want children. I have laid out the plans almost concretely for the next 10 years and there is no way that kids can fit into the life I now want. Is it selfish? Maybe. But I'm okay with that now. I spent 20 years of my life catering to other people and I'm not about to do that again.",childfree
Moms bragging about showering once a week,"Okay...... someone else’s personal hygeine habits are really of no concern to me. That being said, I think its kinda annoying when ‘busy mommas’ make frequent posts on social media about finally getting to take a shower (First one in five days!! Yayy self-care!)
Ummmmm.........wtf?
I realize that many parents say they can’d shower cause their babies and toddlers wont even allow them to take a dump in peace, let alone a shower(!)
I guess it just annoys me because i actually think it’s important for kids to learn that their moms are human beings with needs too. I know a baby or young toddler can’t be reasoned with but I also think that they have to learn that mommy can go do something for a half hour and the world won’t end. Sorry but I’m not going to applaud you for being a martyr to your spawn to this extreme. People have been having kids since the beginning of time, it’s not a new concept.

CF AND Christian?? (rant),"I got divorced in 2013, and every other year I try online dating hoping that THIS time I'll find someone.

Just someone who is not married, not gay, who loves Jesus, is NOT a Trump supporter, and doesn't smoke or do drugs. I get that I live near LA, but c'mon....

Did I miss some part of the Bible that mandates children if you are going to follow Christ?? At this point, I've even opened up to dating people who already have kids - provided they don't want more.

Does supporting another woman's right to breastfeed make you less childfree?,"While scrolling through Facebook yesterday, I came across a post in a childfree group where someone was spewing venom about how breastfeeding in public is ""disgusting"" and how women should show some ""modesty"". The comments on the post were a mixed bag, with some supporting the OP but the majority just told them to shut up and grow up. In the end, OP's last comment before the post was (presumably) deleted by the admins was something to the effect of ""Everyone saying the breast is for the child is in the wrong group.""

Does supporting another woman's right to breastfeed really make one less childfree? Here's the way I see it: I support LGBT rights, including same sex couples getting married and adopting children and trans people expressing themselves in their preferred gender, but I'm just your average straight cis woman. Similarly, I support a woman's right to feed her baby whenever it needs feeding, but I will never be a ""moo cow"" (as one of the commenters on that post so eloquently put it). I get it, breastfeeding is something that may make people uncomfortable, but there's always the option of averting your eyes. Even if that isn't an option, I personally don't mind seeing a sprog with its mouth full of tit so that it isn't left free to scream its lungs out. 

It's also really ironic that one of the people commenting in support of that post said ""I don't mind seeing women going topless, but not breastfeeding."" Yes, go ahead and propagate the view of breasts as sex objects, but God forbid they be used for their primary biological function, right?

This Sub has revealed something to me..... My best friend got bingo'ed into having children....,"And now, three years later, I'm paying for it.

So, a little background.

My best friend was fresh into her 19th year on this Earth, and she was having many personal problems. Some problems she told me about, and others she didn't. Due to this, she had a huge lapse of judgement and decided to not care about her own body, and went on to drink, leave the house for various hours of the day/night, and have dates with anyone she was attracted to.

Every single time she would tell me that she was going somewhere (over the phone since we were in different cities), I always told her to ""dress up"" before she did anything. She'd sigh, say that she would, and tell me that she would be fine. Then, after two flings, one day, she neglected to ""dress"" herself, or her current lover at the time.

This led to her being pregnant with what would become her first child.

Being her best friend who cared for her wellbeing and future as a young adult, I was worried about her. I mean, she just got pregnant with some deadbeat asshole who wouldn't take care of her or the baby, and the majority of her family wouldn't be suitable to even look at the child.

I told her to abort before it grew into a legitimate fetus, but she was unsure about the decision as a whole. I said to abort and take this event as a lesson in **WEARING A DAMN CONDOM** and to never let it happen again, but when she discussed it with her mother, out came this little phrase:

""So I'm just gonna not have grandchildren then?""

The fuck? Your daughter just got pregnant, and she's not ready to have children. My friend has several other siblings who are full grown adults, and they already have children of their own. But since they're all out of the state, and their relationships all strained, she only had her youngest (my best friend) living with her.

This apparently guilt tripped her - on top of that she felt that she had an obligation to this mass of cells that haven't yet become a fetus, which confused me to all hell.

Now, this was before I've consciously declared myself as CF, so I was looking at this situation in a logical sense. She was having many personal problems, her living conditions weren't nearly the best, the only adults in her family she could've trusted was her mother and a handful of others, and she wasn't emotionally or financially able to take care of it. Where was there a good idea in any of this?

Answer: there was none.

I tried to make her see reason, but she made up her mind. So I relented and gave her my support as a friend. I even prayed for her to be able to get by with what she was putting herself through.

Nine months later she had her first son. She managed to get together with a man that she knew when she was a teenager (their relationships was complicated yet romantic, but no illegal events happened.... So she says :/), and they got together and moved out into the mountains.

If she was happy, then I was happy for her. I subconsciously rejoiced that I didn't have to deal with any babies (expect for whenever she visited us with her child in tow).


Fast forward to two years.

My friend went along and got pregnant again. This would be her second son. Again, I knew she was struggling with finances despite her boyfriend having a job and her getting money from college, so I asked her what her reasoning was for having another child. Another tsunami of sleepless nights couldn't be worth it. But this time, the baby had long been a growing fetus, so I knew I couldn't get to her even if I tried. I gave her my support. And my prayers.

Meanwhile,
Life was giving my family a very hard time. Living conditions became very expensive.... we were evicted from our home.

Months after that, my mom had asked my friend if she could take in me and my dog until other living arrangements were managed. They accepted. So now, my jobs were to take care of her toddler son while I was there.

I didn't mind it. I only had to watch one body while everyone else was gone, so I wasn't stressed.... Yet.


Fast forward to present day.

My friend had her second baby last year, and while she was taking care of the child at first, once I was able to catch along with whatever the baby's needs were, I ended up taking care of both the toddler and the newborn baby. Soon, it was me waking up in the middle of the night to change and feed the baby, and if any of the parents woke up, it was to scold me into moving faster to shut the baby up, so they can sleep for work/school.

I don't have a job; my job is to take care of the children. At first it made sense, and a fair trade for me living in their already small home.

But now, I've honestly grown tired of babysitting. The 3 year old is rambunctious as hell, screeching all throughout the day, running back and forth and destroying the house, all with a smile on his face. I'm a lot more patient than my friend, but after a year, my patience is wearing thin. The baby is adorable, sure, but I swear, he only sees me as a food dispenser; he takes one look at me, and he sees bottles and bowls of baby food, not a person. When he cries, he doesn't turn to his actual parents - he turns to me. Same thing with the demon child. When he needs food or a diaper change, he calls my name, walking right past his parents' room and right into the living room where I'm sleeping, slapping me in the face with his icicle hands to wake me up.

And I know that the baby's entirely too young to know any better, but damn, that's what I feel inside.

Now this is where the ""Brant"" part of this long rant comes in.


My friend is on social media, looking at all these pictures and posts that concern her family. Her oldest brother has had another child - a girl. Her sister has apparently had daughters already, and many other family members have at least one girl - except her.

Now, even though she's stressed with work and school and her children (who kinda feel like my children thanks to the boyfriend's family members jokes about how they see me with the children more than the actual mother), she wants to try again in the future for another child, in hopes of having a girl. She talks about dressing her up in cute clothes and teaching her girl things (she's not sexist, but you know what I mean)..... She's fantasizing about all these activities, but the majority of that stuff won't happen until she's at least 5 years old.


She says that if she got another boy, she'd get her tubes tied, but that's not my problem.

My problem is that she wouldn't be taking care of the child - *I* fucking will. She'll be sleeping for school or work while I'm getting up at 1-3 o'clock in the morning taking care of a screaming newborn baby. Just because I don't work doesn't mean that I don't sleep! My body still needs some form of rest.

I used to be a night owl, doing all my favorite hobbies while my family was sound asleep. Now, I have to sleep at night, and wake up in case the baby wakes up. And God forbid that the actual parents have to get up and take care of their children.


Not to mention how small the house is! How will we accommodate for a toddler, a nearly 2-year-old, and a newborn?! Alongside three adults?

And that's not the saddest part. The sad part is when I catch myself saying something that happens further along a child's life, like school, or driving.

""When he gets in middle school, he's totally gonna start fights.""

The fuck? Why am I saying that?  Middle school? That's years from now. Yeeaaars. I'll be in my late twenties to my early thirties by that time....

You know how when you're looking for a job and the interviewer asks you - ""where do you see yourself in (x) amount of year's""? They're talking about career-wise....

Three years ago, I saw myself to just struggle with getting a job, and if I did get one, I would just focus on keeping that job.

Now.... I can't see myself leaving this house that's slowly getting filled with screaming children. I'm tired of waking up in the middle of the night, getting screamed at for not letting the demon child have ice cream, or that piece of candy, or that last bit of food that I made for myself because he's shouting that he wants my food.

""Give it to him! Make yourself another one!"" She says.

One day, I was washing dishes, and my friend's mother was over for her monthly visit. They were discussing about my speed when tending to the baby, and my friend mentioned something about my desires. I love writing, so she told that to her mom.

""Well, she can't focus on that while she lives here. Her focus is on this house and these children. She can't write whenever she wants to.""

I clenched the knife in my hand so tightly, I was shaking.

No writing? I wanted to be a writer due to my love of telling a story. Stories about anything I could think of.

But any ambition that I might've had is not even an option anymore. I have to take care of the children all day and all night.

I want to leave the house so much, but I'm one of those people that values friendship since I've had my touch and go experiences with friends. Many of them being bad. This woman has been my friend since 4th grade. I don't want to ruin anything just because I'm not taking care of her children anymore. I don't want to sound ungrateful. Cause I am, I am so much..... I just don't know how much longer I can take this. And if she does end up with another child....

I just might end up having a fucking breakdown.

Now I just take my leave.... The demon child is currently kicking and jumping on me, and I'm on the verge of screeching like a banshee.

Tubal litigation vs bilat salpinectomy,"I had an OBGYN consult last week and it went great. The doctor wad professional and respectful and would be more than willing to do my sterilization procedure.

I walked into the office wanting the BS, but one thing he mentioned has me nervous. There's the (rare) chance that when they cut the fallopian tube near the ovary, that the blood vessels feeding the ovary could be damaged, which could possibly result in early menopause. I'm 33 and that's the last thing I want! To anyone who has had either of these procedures, can you tell me your reasoning for choosing one over the other?

"Dude, you're ALREADY having kids?","Alright so I'm 18, recently made a Facebook to keep up with social events for the clubs that I'm in, and found an old friend who's about 2 years older than me on there and decided to friend her. I hadn't talked to her since she graduated and was wondering how she was doing post-high school.

Now I always thought that we were super similar! I like emo bands, she likes emo bands. I like calculus, she likes calculus. I like Iron Man comics, she likes Iron Man comics (sidenote: Valerio Schiti isn't gonna be the artist for TS:IM anymore and I've never been more sad). So imagine my surprise when I find out that she's pregnant with baby #2! I was pretty shocked when I found this out, so I asked her how she was balancing college with her kids. We were on the debate team together and last I heard from her, she was planning on doing political science for undergrad and then going to law school.  Here's where the big shock comes: she's a stay-at-home mom now. Her boyfriend got her pregnant at the end of her senior year and since then, she's been focusing on her family while he goes to school and works part-time. Thankfully his parents are helping out, because if my memory of post-tournament parties serves me right, she is NOT someone I would trust around a very breakable baby. She doesn't seem like a full-on mombie, she's not tired or bitter or anything, but her Facebook *is* pretty much just baby pictures and cheesy ""wine mom"" memes. Never mind the fact that she thinks wine is a drink for people who can't handle hard liquor, I guess.

What is the weirdest thing someone has said they can’t do/enjoy anymore because they’re a parent?,"I (29F) have been working with coworkers who are mothers in their 20s or 30s for five years at my job. I’m *technically* a fencesitter but my husband and I lean strongly towards childfree. I have been on the fence my whole life but dealing with these mothers has pushed me more and more toward CF. 

I’ve heard about the things that having children has ruined for them: their nipples (they have calluses), their hair (you sometimes lose it or grow weird post-baby bangs after giving birth), their own birthdays (“It’s not about you anymore once you have kids”), drinking (you can develop alcohol allergies after birth), etc. etc. 

But yesterday, we were talking about bold, chunky necklaces and a coworker said, “I love chunky necklaces too, but you know, after having kids I just can’t anymore.” I know babies like to grab at jewelry but her kids are too old for that. Why would having children ruin NECKLACES for you?!

'Just wait until you accidentally get pregnant!',"My dad is normally a very sweet and understanding man, and a great father, but something he said recently had stuck with me for being very inappropriate. 


We were talking about kids and how both my brother (18) and I (19) despise children and will probably never have any. I told him I never even want to be pregnant, as it grosses me out and scares me, and I never want to put my body through all that. 
Without missing a beat he went 'Oh, Just wait until you accidentally get pregnant!' 


I was honestly kinda shocked that he would say such a thing, I mean, maybe I'm overreacting but that seems like such a creepy thing to say? It was very out of character for him.


Anyways, I replied with 'I'm not gonna get pregnant accidentally, but if I do, I'll get an abortion.' Cue him being absolutely bewildered that I would ever consider such a thing. He said that he would raise the (completely hypothetical) child if I didn't want it. My dad's almost sixty, my mom is out of the picture, and I don't want anything to do with children. No way any of this was gonna happen.
I live in the Netherlands, so not only is abortion legal,  it's relatively easy to get one, and I'm planning to get sterilized as soon as possible anyways. I have a whole mess of shitty genes I wouldn't want any kid to inherit, and most importantly, I Just cannot stand children.

I just sent some dumb meme back and didn’t really confront him about it because I was so shocked. Like that’s where he draws the line??

How can parents be so cruel to their kids for something as innocent as being CF?,"Apologies for the wall of text below. I'm just ranting, but I also wanna know what you guys think and hear your experiences. To preface, my mom is (I think) 100% supportive of my CF decision. I feel terribly for those of you that don't have that, but keep making the right decisions for you. It's worth it. 

TL;DR: Parents who disapprove of their kids being CF to the point where they cause friction in the relationship or cut them off in any way are horrible, selfish people. 

Parents berate, ostracize, and cut off their kids for a variety of reasons. A few of those reasons may be legit, but being childfree should NEVER be one of them. I can't believe how many stories I've read of people whose parents became utterly furious at even the idea of their kids not giving them grandkids. It baffles me that they go so far as to cut them out of their will and refuse to be a part of their lives anymore. I just don't understand *why*. 

Being childfree is not a crime. It is not terrorism, running around with gangs, killing people, or whatever are the worst things you can think of people doing. It is not even just being a bad person in general. Parents have tons of worse things they could get mad at their kids about, yet they think that being CF, which is an individual's right to decide, is something to be angry about. Why? There's no risk involved. It doesn't hurt anybody. It's not the grave, mortal sin that they try to spin it as, and they know that. Every individual has the right and the responsibility to decide whether to have kids based solely on THEIR personal circumstances. Not based on whether or not their parents wanna be grandparents. Parents have no right to get even the slightest bit angry at their kids for deciding to do what's best for their lives and not have kids. 

A lot of us have physical/mental health reasons, among others, for being CF. Why wouldn't that be good enough for our own parents, who are supposed to care the most about our health out of everyone else in the world? If we are simply making a decision that is best for us physically, emotionally, and mentally, even though it's not what our parents had hoped for, then shouldn't they be even a little bit happy for us? Why is it so impossible for them to even try to understand? Why is it always ""nope, wrong decision. You're cut off/ don't talk to me/ I'm very disappointed in you""?  That's incredibly ridiculous. They can't even bring themselves to look on the bright side and think ""well, at least there's no chance my daughter will have a bad pregnancy or die in childbirth"" or ""at least my son will never have to struggle to provide for a bunch of kids."" It's so easy to think about that when parents have only love and unselfish attitudes towards their kids.

Also, why do parents take their kids' CF choice so personal? Why is it that I constantly see stories where the parents say ""Was I not a good mom/dad? Where did *I* go wrong? What did *I* ever do to you to make you wanna hurt me this way?"" Are we the only people who see the insanity in those questions? Quite often, our CF choice does NOT stem from how poorly we were raised. Sometimes it does, but those same bad parent experiences could also make a person *want* to have kids and do things differently. Not even parents who are very religious or tie their spirituality/meaning of life into having kids have the right to be mad at their kids for being CF. Procreating is not our savior. It is not up to every single individual to have a kid in order for humanity to survive, since we as a species are still doing (excessively) well with the population thing. God does not get mad at people for not having kids, and there is not a single scripture that condemns the CF. 

No parent who would treat their kids like this even deserves the joy they see in being a grandparent. If tons more people decided to be CF, that would probably expose the selfishness and greed of a lot more parents, and call into question humanity's real motives behind having so many freaking kids. Or maybe I'm just fantasizing. Ok rant over.",childfree

The DJ was on point, the vow renewal was sweet, the company was fabulous and my girlfriend’s young (5 and 7) nephews were a highlight.

I said to the mom of the boys, “I don’t spend much time with children, though I have a preference for the well-behaved ones. Your boys are a delight to be around.” She said, “Thanks, we worked really really hard on that.” I told her I could tell. One of the boys sat near me off and on through the evening and was as sweet as he could be. I flattened down his hair a couple times, told him he could only pass by if he knew the password, and then I taught him and some other little boys how to dance Gangnam style.

An excerpt that sums up how I feel,"From Arthur Schopenhauer’s essay ‘On the suffering of the world’ chapter 9 page 48


“If the act of procreation were neither the outcome of a desire nor accompanied by feelings of pleasure, but a matter to be decided on the basis of purely rational considerations, is it likely the human race would still exist? Would each of us not rather have felt so much pity for the coming generation as to prefer to spare it the burden of existence, or at lease not wish to take it upon himself to impose that burden upon it in cold blood?”

I’m not interested in marrying you or having kids!,"I’m a 21 year old female that is in university. I have had a few dates here and there, but I am in a healthy long-term relationship now. 

This past week, a friend of mine mentioned how he wants to do the military after he graduates in 2 years. I told him that’s a great if that is his dream and he should follow it. Y’all. He got up fast from the desk in class and said, “you would just let me go like that!” I’m completely shocked and gobsmacked at the reaction and gave a very profound and very needed “huh”. He begins this speech (?) of dialogue of “I can wait 10 years to have kids you know, I’m willing to wait for you. I always wanted to get married when I graduate though”. 

I thought I was on that WWYD honestly. Where the hell does John get off telling me what the hell I want? I tell him, “look I’m not marrying anyone until I’m easily in my 30’s and I’m not having children. I’m in a healthy long-term relationship and if your dream is join the military, then you go for it. Besides, what type of friend would I be to keep you from your dream”. I told my other friends about this and many of them think it’s romantic to get married after graduating from university. I’ve applied to multiple graduate programs and am hoping to continue my education. I’m graduating early this semester with my undergraduates at 21. I’m really proud of my success.

I just hate this feeling that society only views me as a “successful” woman if I am married and have kids. I may never get married or have children and that is fine. I may get married and never have kids and that is chill too. I’m just annoyed that at 21 people are expecting me to seriously consider having children. I am 21!

A brief list of random shit I can do because I don’t have kids.,"Hi.  

I love that there is a place to talk about the vacations we take, the cars we can buy, the hours we clan sleep, the silence we enjoy... 

But, in the past two weeks, I have become acutely aware of the most random shit I can do, because I do not have kids.  I want to share this list and perhaps hear some of the random shit you may have noticed: 

1.) Purchasing not just one eye cream, but one for morning application and one for evening application.   I don’t know how I would afford two separate, high quality eye creams if I was also paying for 309 cans of baby food per week (or worse yet, cream for my breasts since a child would be sucking all the majesty from them). 

2.) Taking dedicating an additional 5-7 minutes to my skin care routine in both the morning and evening to ensure that I adequately saturate the skin on my orbital bones with these creams.  How could I do this in the morning if I was wrestling with a four year old, begging them, for the love of fuck, to eat just two more bites of Cheerios?  Or, in the evening if I, god forbid, had to read a child the same book for the 80th time.  

3.)  Making an educated decision on which apples to buy this week at the grocery store.  Yeah, I stood in the midst of a grocery store, surrounded by the cacophony of of children ages 2-6, while googling which apples might be best for pie and and which might be best for simply shoving into my face.  Try doing that with a 3 year old desperately reaching for something in the cart behind them and screaming like they’re being murdered. 

4.)  A long agonizing wall-sit at the gym without experiencing the horror of vaginal prolapse. 

5.)  You guys, my dogggggg (or perhaps your cat or other critter).   She is 75lbs of soft, warm, insatiable snuggle and, on a cold fall morning, I spooned the bejesus out of her until I felt like getting up and making huevos rancheros.   Can’t do that when you have a kid jumping on your bed begging for Cheerios they aren’t gonna eat. 

6.)  There is so much shit all over the place in my house.   Yeah, we clean.... when we feel like it.  If we had kids, you can bet I’d be prying plastic bags, old work paper, a slipper, staples and hangers out of mouths all the time.

I said that the easiest way to save the planet was to stop having kids and this guy completely missed the point,"I was in my conservation class and, I will be the first to admit that my answer was unnecessary. My professor asked us at the end of class some easy ways we could avoid overexploitation of natural resources. Me, being the smart ass I am, said, ""the best environmental solution is to stop having kids.""

Then there was this guy in the front who felt the need to mansplain to me how that would eff over the economy. That ""our economy is doomed because damn millennials aren't having kids!"" Keep in mind that this guy is in his early twenties...

Also keep in mind that I said nothing about the economy. Like, not one thing. 

First of all, screw you. 
Secondly, I said that this was the best solution for the environment. Thinking economically about everything is what put the planet in this mess to begin with because you're part of the problem.
And, a third point that I feel doesn't get enough credit these days, I WAS JOKING! I know breeders is gonna breed. I wasn't actually telling people to stop having kids, I was trying to make the damn professor smile! Shut up and quit flexing, nobody's impressed!

All I answered back with verbally was, ""I said that would be the best solution ENVIRONMENTALLY not economically"" and he said ""Yeah, yeah, whatever.""

Puppies vs. Children,"I got a puppy about a month ago and he is so amazing. A lot of friends and family are visiting often to meet him because he won’t be a puppy for long! 

My older sister has a friend with a 2 year old son, and she came to visit today to meet my pup. He is a very calm child and he’s pretty cute. But he recently just started walking/running on his own. Just watching him today was a great reminder of why I don’t want children. People compare having puppies to having a newborn child. But I just don’t agree. 

When you think about it, I have had my pup for 1 month and he is about 3.5 months old. I have taught him to sit, lay down, give me paw, drop it, come and stay and he is also fully potty trained now. Meanwhile, my sisters’s friend has a 2 year old that doesn’t come when his mother calls him, he won’t sit still, he will pick up everything in his sight and throw it, he needs his diaper changed throughout the day, he still has to be hand fed and he really only started walking a few months ago.

Don’t get me wrong, having a puppy is hard work, and I’m pretty tired from waking up in the middle of the night to take him outside or getting up at 5am everyday to feed him. He cries at night while we’re still in crate training mode. But I know this stage of his life will only last a few more months. And honestly, it’s not nearly as difficult as I imagine a baby would be. At least my “baby” can walk at his age. Basically what I am trying to say, is that my puppy has been alive for 3.5 months and he’s already learned a lot and is more well behaved than a 2 year old human being. 

I love being a mom. But only as a Dog Mom. My puppy is great and I am so happy he’s not a human baby.

I am forced to babysit my younger siblings almost daily.,"(I just want to apologize if this isn’t acceptable in this reddit, I just wasn’t sure where to go.)

Hi, my name is Carrie. I’m currently 17. I’m not here to tell you my life story, but in order for you to understand this rant (if anyone actually reads it) I feel like I have to tell you a little bit about my past. I’ve always had very bad mental health, multiple suicide attempts, anxiety attacks almost everyday, cutting, not eating, etc., but anyways, to cut to the point of my past, my dad was abusive to everyone so my parents divorced and that’s where I was forced to play the second parent. When I was 10, that’s when I started to have to take care of my little brother, he’s 4 years younger than me. It wasn’t that hard at first since it’s just him and we got along pretty well. My mom then had my littlest brother, my parents divorced very shortly after he was born. He was recently diagnosed with autism, so it’s a little harder to babysit. My mom works 5 days a week, typically it’s a 6am-7pm shift. I do online classes instead of going to school because I currently behind. I haven’t had much of a problem until recently, I feel like I’m a prisoner in my own home and I feel like I’m losing my teenage years due to being a parent I never signed up for. I get frustrated very easily now and I even start to yell and hit things (not the kids, just like the wall). My mom doesn’t know because I’ll just get in trouble. I can tell it is effecting my mental health. I understand that my mom needs to work to have money for us, I really do understand that, but I don’t want to do this anymore. I feel like I’m at my breaking point and I’m gonna snap one day. 

I want to clarify, I’d never hurt my brothers and I love them to death, so please don’t think otherwise.

(EDIT:

Thank you guys for the support, help, and ideas. I feel like I left some details out that might help. 

My littlest brother does in fact go to a special school for kids with autism, but he only goes two days a week, but only for 3 hours. And yes it’s a nice little break so I can do whatever homework or chores I have. But I still have to deal with my other brother, it’s horrible with him. He is an exact copy of my dad, he doesn’t listen at all and he’s very abusive. And I know it sounds stupid that my little brother acts in an abusive way towards me, but he does not take me seriously. He’s even gotten physical with me when he doesn’t get what he wants. And yes, I tell my mom, but he just gets a little slap on the wrist and he doesn’t take her seriously either. I’ve had many breakdowns because of him, no matter what I do or say he doesn’t listen. And he significantly larger than me so he could easily push me around. 

Those for saying I should talk to a counselor or family: I don’t have much family and I don’t have a school counselor. When I went to public school, I did talk to my counselor but she never really helped and she sent child services to my house because I brought up something that happened but that’s the most action that’s happened. My family is small and it always has been. But there’s a fight going on in the family right now, and for some reason they’re mad at me so no one is talking to me. I have my grandma and my two aunts. I’m not allowed to tell my family about my mental health. That’s what I was told by my mom. That’s the thing about my mom, if it makes her look bad I’m not allowed to say it. And my two aunts know about my mental health very much, but they’re too focused on my cousin because she’s the “first baby” of the family. And I wish I was exaggerating that. I don’t tell my mom anything about my mental health getting worse because everytime I’d try to talk about it it suddenly turned to her and how her life is so much harder. I get completely shut down, if I make one mistake she always has the same three threats: she threatens to get rid of my cat (not certified yet, but my emotional support animal), she threatens to send me to live with my abusive dad, and she threatens to send me to an asylum. When I took a bunch of pills to overdose, I told her and she simply dismissed me and the only reason I went to the hospital is because the school sent me. She is also very, I guess rude, to me. She told me that she gets mad at me easily simply because I look like my dad and my brothers don’t. She yells at me over every little thing, as I was typing this paragraph she called me out of my room and just started yelling because I was just in my bed. We argue a lot because she nags me so much and badgers me. I don’t hate my mom and I don’t want her to get into any trouble because my brothers need her, but I don’t know what to do. )",childfree

Should I go to Thanksgiving and inevitably argue with a confrontational family member due to my CF decisions?,"I've been lurking on this sub for awhile now and replied to a few people but never have I posted; however I'm currently in a bit of a bind and would like some advice on how to proceed.

Some background: my s/o and I have been together for 3 years and are firmly CF. He has never wanted children for his own reasons that span a long list and I have severe tokophobia and  a severe disdain for children that I won't get into. I have been sterilized and this is known on my side of the family and the people on my side of the family who know, (I'm selective with who I interact with) are accepting of my decisions. However, my s/o doesn't really talk about his personal life outside of academics to his family and because he and I aren't married, we've been lucky enough to not be bingoed by his immediate relatives. However, I've just been told that his last surviving grandmother is dying and would like us all to go to Thanksgiving out of state where they live. This would involve family I've never met and most notably his grandfather who is known to 1: dislike my s/o very much and 2: be extrenely confrontational and pick arguments with ""new people."" I know children and reproductive rights are on the table for debate (his family told me that he WILL bring up politics) and I know that other things about me are fairly easy to start a debate over (gender dysphoria and visible tattoos which is a big problem for this family in general for some reason). In general, I just do not feel comfortable attending this Thanksgiving because I will fight back and things WILL get out of hand very quickly especially if this guy pushes the wrong buttons on me. 

The CF part is just the tip of the iceburg too. These grandparents are extremely catholic (which is fine) but I really do not want to argue religion and politics with people who have a basis on me that spans no further than taking a glance at my outward appearance and which grandson I chose to fall in love with. It would only be for a day and a half but I'm really considering bailing on this despite my s/o's family really wanting me to go.

I have an epinephrine pen that I carry with me everywhere so in case im alone and i ever do go into shock then I just give myself the pen and ill be able to breath long enough to call 911.

So when me and my parents were moving out of our old house there was a family that came in to check out the house. This particular family had a 6 or 7 year old kid and he was eating crackers and dipping it in cheese sauce or whatever the fuck it was(cheese is something im allergic to). I was very worried so I asked the mom if she could tell her kid to keep the crackers away from me as i have food allergies and all that. The mom was fairly nice about it so I thought that was that.

Later when we were showing them the upstairs I noticed that the kid was straying away from the group and rubbing cheese on the fucking walls. So I went over and told the kid to stop what he was doing and go to his mom. I was bending down to talk to him and this kid then proceeds to rub cheese on my face(getting some in my mouth) and runs off. 

At this point I was pissed the fuck off but all I could do was call my dad to get the epi-pen and he gave it to me while my mom called 911 and I went to the hospital. The parents were unapolegetic and rude to my parents about the whole incident, and before we got in the car I heard my dad say ""well good luck finding a house because youre sure as hell not getting this one"". We went to the hospital and I stayed there overnight and I was released the next day. It was by far the scariest experience of my life and I think it was the main factor in me deciding to be childfree.

Thanks to anyone who read about my experience, I'll be sure to answer any questions anyone has in the comments.",childfree

Little Things Make Me Glad To Be Child-Free,"I placed a to-go order at a fast food place (its cheat day - don't judge!) 

Standing off to the side of the older lady and young boy (4/5 y/o) in front of me is a manager holding a tray with fries and a burger. He grabs a couple fries and starts munching on them. The older lady is trying to get the kid to decide what he wants. 

The manager is telling the woman to order this item for him. The older woman has trouble with swiping her card so the manager (that is obviously on his break) steps him to assist. The order is placed and as the woman waits for her receipt, the boy raises his voice. 

""DADDY, I want my cup!"" 

As the Dad bends over to talk to his son, his expensive phone falls out of his pocket and hits the floor. The boy hands it to him and says, 

""You have to wait! Calm down, there's people behind you!"" 

I lock eyes with the manager and he smiles and goes, ""Kids."" 

I smile back and nod, not saying a word. The Dad/Manager walks behind the counter and grabs the cups, still carrying his lunch tray. The cashier says, ""I didn't forget the cups.""

""I know, he's just impatient."" 

I chuckled to myself as my turn was finally up and my order took two seconds to place and it was up and I was gone in just a few short minutes. It makes me appreciate that as chaotic as my job gets, my breaks are *mine.*

"Well, what did I expect when bringing a uterus to the gym","I was at the gym with two friends, we're all early twenties females (and 2/3 openly CF). We're doing barbell hip thrusts when two old men (mid-70's probably) walk by and look at us with absolute disgust. One of them eventually comes back and asks if we know how unhealthy this exercise is, and we're just like ???????. He then proceeds to explain that we shouldn't be putting heavy weight on our uteri, genitalia and hips like that, because it will prevent us from having kids later, and how we should start thinking about the future, we wouldn't want to be barren, now would we, women like us in the good, child-bearing age!! 

It was so completely unexpected, transgressive, rude and unbeliavable that we all just stared dumbfoundedly at him while he lectured us on our anatomy (incorrectly, mind you). At the end we asked him to leave us alone and mind his own business and he left, huffing and puffing.

Screeming banshees in a tea room,"So I never go to those places, they are not my cup of tea, lol. But a woman that I wanted to date suggested one, saying that it would be quieter and more peaceful than the brewery or the bar I suggested. So, you can see where things are going. 

The place was a little too romantic/cheesy for my taste, but ok, it's a date, why the hell not try it I thought. That was before a family entered: the mum taking pictures of the landscape through the windows; the dad, a business man, talking no stop on cellphone; the kids, two screaming little girls. 

The girls ran the entire time they were there, screaming they wanted cake with a sound that only bats would comprehend, they stumbled on us two times, they even hide under our table, they were constantly opening and closing the door making the little bell ring, and one even went out of the place to the street without their parents even noticing a thing. I was more concerned than the parents! Although the date sucked because of this, we bonded a little on our disliking of kids (thanks OkCupid). But I won't go back to a tea room ever again!

How did I forget...,"This is kinda a rant, it doesn't really fit any of the others. 

So I love one tree hill, I grew up with it and the cheesy, dramatic plots just stuck with me. 

I decided to do a rewatch with the DVDs I had and I've not done that in a few years but as I was watching it, I just realized how baby crazy they all are. 

Like nearly every season, kids or baby's are involved. Examples, season 1&amp;2 had Jake and Jenny. 3 had a naley and Karen get pregnant at the end. 4 had Haley and Karen pregnant the whole season. 5 Jamie was now in it and for some reason brooke got the baby rabies. 6 Peyton and Lucas got pregnant and it was really bad but Peyton couldn't bear to not have the kid even though it was high risk. 

7 only has that girl pretend Nathan impregnated her. I  think haley got preggers again. 

8 Haley has her baby and Brooke reaaaaally gets the baby rabies again but finds out she can't have bio kids, Julian gets sad cause he wants kids. They look into adoption after declaring at some point that it's not the same. Conveniently, Brooke CAN get pregnant and she's up the duff by the finale. Howwww sweet. 

9 Brookes babbbiies are here and ensue all the reasons I don't want kids. No sleep and they basically go crazy. 

I really reaaaaally loved this show but after this rewatch I kinda felt sick, it just felt like all they talked about was marriage and babies.

Perfect CF night AND perfect CF crew,"Last night my Dungeons &amp; Dragons crew was celebrating one of our people’s birthday with a small get-together involving drinking, smoking, and watching fails.

When a friend keeps using the “I’m a mom now you need to understand” as an excuse for everything... and it’s beginning to irk me,"My friend had a kid with a guy she had been planning on leaving. She was super unhappy with him. She has cheated on him, she’s left him and moved with another boyfriend and then got back with him, she’s made plans behind his back to move out etc.... she was about to move out when she found out she was pregnant last year. I was so bummed because she had  been staying there because she claimed she couldn’t afford to leave. Her sister was willing to take her in and boom. She was pregnant and she had that crazy “I’m in my 30s I need to have a baby” bug

Now that she’s a mom, I see dude helping but only as much as he should. It doesn’t feel like a combined or United relationship. 

Lately, she’s been tryin to make plans with me but it gets very dizzying. She’ll make plans but ask what I want to do. When I tell her, she’ll offer what she wants to do and I’ll tell her that’s fine. She’ll then a day later text me she can’t find a sitter but we can do my original plan and she’ll bring the kid..

This goes on and on and on with her. 

We spent 2 weeks going in circles about making plans this past weekend. I kept telling her whatever  works. She then accused me of changing the plans which messed up her baby sitter but when I told her we can stick to those plans; the baby sitter already had other plans anyway and she said she would ask someone else. I almost felt she wanted those plans all along (they involved a bar) and when I gave her a more boring option she began the blame game... 

She keeps telling me firmly “I’m a mother now so it’s hard for me to make plans you need to understand” 

I think I get that part.  You are also an adult so you figure out your logistics and then you make plans..

It’s just an excuse to me and almost like she’s trying to say she has more going on than me...

She wanted this. She even has told me she looks at it like he gave her a baby but she doesn’t need to stay with him forever 🤔😩 like he’s a baby vessel 

The excuse making is horrible and annoying though and I’m sick of it",childfree

There are CHILDREN waiting!!!!!!,"Every fall I go to the Renaissance Festival with my friends. We dress up, drink, and thoroughly enjoy a day of not taking ourselves seriously. One highlight of the festival for me is holding a goose. There is just something calming about holding a big fat goose that nudges you for pets and gives out “hugs”. 
My husband and I were in line to hold one when a grandmother and her two tween grand kids started asking the few of us who were in the line “where is the line? Where do we go?” The 20 something guy in front of me said the line was right here where we were all standing. Then the old biddy started yelling, “I thought this was only for children. Why are their adults in line when there are children who want to hold them?” It took everything in me to turn around with a big smile and say, “oh gosh. This is my favorite part of the fair. I come every year to hold Lucy the Goose.” 
When it was my turn to go up, she immediately starts yelling, “Come on. Hurry up. There are CHILDREN waiting for their turn!!!!” No one was in line behind her so he and I just sat there for a solid 6-8 minutes talking about his animals and holding the goose. I can’t imagine the cringe those tweens were experiencing spending the day with their rude, entitled grandma—-and lets be real there is no way she was tipping any of the performers they interacted with.",childfree
SIL Baby-Brain-Surrogacy-Fantasy,"First time post, basically going with chain of thought writing on a mobile phone, sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes as I am sleep deprived as I made this.

My husband and I (both 28) don't want kids at all. To make matters better for us both of us have found out we are basically infertiler (major info for later). We have told this to our families since before we got engaged/married and made sure to reinforce this to each our of parents. Once in a while my mom asks me if I'm sure about not having kids but she doesn't push it, other than that no one alls has pushed us on the topic on my side. I thought that everyone on his side also got it through thier heads but turns out no they did not. Just earlier his week I woke up to my husband telling me that his mom called to inform him that his older sister (30 with 2 kids and a 3rd on the way) has been telling people that we change our minds (we have not) and that we asked her to be our surrogate to carry her future niece or nephew (never even thought of it). 
Here is the rant part:
Never ever have we told her we wanted kids, ever!
 A few months ago during a random road trip driving back home she suddenly started hounding my husband (her brother) of when would we give her kids a cousin. She then proceeded to bingo him left and right about it. She said everything from ""it's different when it's your own"", to ""It's not real love when you adpot them"", every single thing on a bing card in a span of 10 minutes.  All this while her 2 year old is screaming and crying for no reason for the past 30 minutes behind me. She never asked me about why I don't want kids or acknowledged me during her mombie brain rant. My husband then tell we are infertile last ditch to get her to stop.
Wrong move she then came up with ""I wILl bE yOuR sUrrOGatE! Omg I would love that to do that for you guys."" He quickly tell her ""Thanks but my wife and I don't want kids!"" 
Don't remember what was said next because I finally got her to acknowledge that her child was screaming bloody murder this whole time. Since then she hasn't said anything in front of me but yesterday my husband confessed: Every time she calls him she fucken spends 5-10 minutes pushing for him for us to join her in being miserable in parenthood. She thinks she can change his mind and then him push me to have a parasite for her pleasure to have a niece or nephew for her to enjoy. 
I have come to also find out she just wants to keep getting pregnant and spewing kids not just for herself but for others. According to my MIL my SIL wants to be a surrogate for a friend of hers that has 4 kids but can't have more.
 I swear she has lost her mind because we found out she was telling her mom (my MIL) and others that we are going to have kids through her. Like what the fuck last time I saw her she got drunk/high and didn't tell me about her weird ass fantasy. We never told anyone or ourselves we wanted kids or for her to be our surrogate. This has never been even discussed with her, hinted or secretly told to her. We (my husband, MIL and I) have been blindsided with this fantasy she came up with and don't know where she got the idea. 
I don't know how to even tell her that I know she has been telling people this and to stop asking us to have kids. If and when I do it will be a shit show because the woman in my husband's family go full on crazy when confronted about things. She is also pro-force woman to carry unwanted pregnancies because she loves crotch goblins.
 I seriously hate confrontation but this crossed the line with me and I don't know how to handle it. It bothers me so much it made me hit a depressive/anxiety episode which I lashed out at my husband over nothing last night. It's also majorly affecting my husband since he is the one getting pushed by his sister about it for months and he never told me.

"""That's such a financially irresponsible decision.""","Imagine you're me, I've worked in tech for 10 years in a variety of places (FAANG, big enterprise, startup, etc) and held a variety of roles (software engineer, network engineer, DevOps, Systems Engineer). Throughout this time, I've diligently saved and invested 20-75% of my pay and I've lived modestly (in fact I live with my parents now which enables me to save an additional $2K/mo). I've also had a few lucky breaks with some investments (crypto, TSLA (In $70-120, Out $340-$360)).

Anyways, in a 2-3 years I plan on buying a Tesla Model 3 Performance in Deep Blue Metallic with the Black and White interior. The car will cost me roughly $59K of which I plan to put down $20K and finance the rest. I could buy it in cash, but why do that when my cash is making me 15%+ gains year after year and I can get a 2-3% loan easily?

I've told this to a few of my child-having friends and one of their wives (who hates me because I show her husband glimpses of childless freedom) said what I titled this post. Keep in mind, they ""accidentally"" had 2 children when they were in their early to mid 20's. During this time, I was working 70-80 hour weeks laying the foundation of my career while they were barely sleeping and distracted at work due to their children.

How is taking out a $39K loan for 4-5 years with a monthly cost of $650ish on a car that I plan to keep for 10 years irresponsible when they are spending $1.5K/mo on daycare, an additional $1K on random childcare stuff and having to buy larger gas-powered cars that are much less efficient than a Tesla.",childfree

A refreshing conversation I had the other day,"I was chatting with a friend at my university a few days ago, when a friend of his joined the conversation. My friend had to leave, so us two girls continued to chat. At some point she mentioned she had a 5 y/o, and I mentioned I disliked kids.

She: It's interesting to hear that! I like children so much (she is studying to be a kindergarten teacher), it's nice to hear the other side of the arguement.

I loved that she said that! She didn't bingo me at all, she was just interested in a different point of view. I said that I was indifferent to the ""cuteness of kids"", and I was unconfortable with the idea of pregnancy. She then admitted that she hated being pregnant, she got ill a lot and had a horrible, long birth. And people looked shocked when she said that.

I said I was more open to adoption (not that open, I'm still CF), and she said she'd love to have another kid with her current partner, and she totally considered it too.

She genuinely seemed to enjoy being a mother, and she just thought it was cool that people disagreed with her. I think she hasn't met that many CF people in her life, I hope I helped her feel validated in her feelings she was she helped me.",childfree
What do you mean I have to wait in line at the DMV?,"So I had the pleasure of spending 2 hours at the DMV the other day, and the woman directly behind me grabbed a chair from outside the rope we were all waiting in and started dragging it through the line with her. One of the employees finally spoke up and said 

“Ma’am those chairs aren’t supposed to be in the line.” 

Her - “Well I’ve been waiting in this line for 40 minutes and I need to sit down.” 

“Ma’am if you have a medical condition that prevents you from standing you should have let someone know at the front and we would’ve made accommodations for you, but you can’t just move our chairs around.” 

Her- “Excuse me I am PREGNANT (for the record, she was barely showing) and I can’t wait in line. What do you expect me to do? Give up my place in line now? This is taking too long.” 

“Ma’am if you have to leave the line you are welcome to do so.” 

Her- “Well are you going to save my place in line? I can’t wait like this again.” 

Me - “Oh my god what did you think the DMV was going to be?” 

Her- “You dont understand. I’m PREGNANT.”

Me- “No you don’t understand. I’m DISABLED and half the people in this line are elderly. Wait in line like everyone else.” 

Her- “You can’t talk to me like that. I need to sit down. I am carrying a child. Someone hold my spot” 

She proceeded to go under the rope to sit an inch outside of it for literally two minutes because we were already at the front of the line at this point. When she got back in line she made sure to very loudly thank the person behind me for being “sUcH A NiCe PeRsOn”

Seriously what did she think was going to happen at the DMV? And in the middle of the afternoon? It is literally most known for taking for taking forever and for having long lines. You go to the store to buy things, you go to the DMV to wait in line. It’s common knowledge. Letting someone cum in you doesnt grant you special privileges, especially when you act like an entitled bitch about it. 

I admit I might just be extra touchy about this because I actually genuinely am disabled and waiting in that line was making my legs hurt so bad but I knew it was my own fault for not asking about handicap services before getting in line. On my way out I made sure to make eye contact as I limped past her.",childfree
We've been named to get friend's kids in their will! Awkward as hell! Help!,"My partner and I are very much CF. 

Our two friends have three kids and we spend time with them mostly just as a couple and on the odd occasion we have spent time with them as a family. We've also helped out once or twice as emergency babysitters which has mainly involved just sitting at their house watching TV while the kids amuse themselves. Sometimes we play boardgames or computer games with them. For some reason they think we're very cool and get excited when they see us whereas we feel we hardly know them.

Last night we were out having drinks with these friends and the wife, Rachelle, says to us they have to tell us something really exciting. Husband, Jon, tells her to be quiet and says now is not the time. He downplays the situation and says as we are planning to have dinner with them anyway in a few days they will tell us some news then. 

Partner and I are obviously curious but we respect Jon's wishes and talk no more about it. By the end of the night we've all had a few drinks and are waiting for taxis. 

Jon and Rachelle get their taxi first and as Rachelle hugs me good bye she tells me excitedly ""we updated our will. If we die, you get our house... And we want you to have the kids!"" 

I was speechless and visably shocked and I think she mistakes this for gratitude or something and tells me she loves me and off they go in the taxi.

Awful end to the night and now we're freaking out. What the hell do we say? We don't even want to go to this dinner if this is the bombshell. We don't want their kids! We don't want their house! Also it's a bit insulting. We rent. Is this their way of selling their kids to us? With a free house?

Do we just say thank you but no thank you. This will surely ruin a really good friendship. Or do we just say thank you and hope nothing happens to them. And what if something does? Do we just say no then. They must have a back up plan? We have no idea how to handle this. It's so bizarre. I thought they knew we were CF.",childfree

Alice showed up to work once, wearing a t-shirt designed/aimed at showing off her décolletage (look it up).

Coworker loses it after I tell him I’d rather shoot myself in the head than have a child,"I’m only 19 and can’t imagine how I have to go the rest of my life shutting down bingos.

My coworkers and I were talking about our grandparents who had 10+ kids and I brought up current climate change issues after one of my friends said he wants to have at least 6 kids. They asked me how many I want and when I said none, they all started lecturing me. My 53 year old EXTREMELY conservative coworker who once told me “I only said to my sons two things: no drugs and no being gay,” started bingoing me left and right:

“Who poisoned your mind? Just you wait. You’re gonna get married and want to have kids with him. I don’t know who made you think this way but it’s not okay.”

Then two other coworkers started bingoing me after I told him I’m getting a bilateral salpingectomy in two years when my insurance will cover it. I asked them several times WHY they wanted kids because they couldn’t really answer me. They acted as if they never even thought about WHY. They told me because taking care of babies and having a family seems so fun and rewarding. I asked them why they didn’t seem excited about raising preteens and teenagers. Why didn’t they gush about that like they did with babies? They didn’t answer.

I asked them if they believed every single woman in the world wanted kids and they said no, but lots of people say they don’t and change their mind. Even after telling them multiple times how depressed I would be because just the thought of having kids makes me want to kill myself, they kept telling me not to get sterilized because I will regret it.

My mom is supportive of me being childfree so I ranted to her about how disrespected I felt but as soon as I brought up sterilization she lost it. I’m diabetic so everything that could go wrong is a much higher risk for me so even if I wanted to ruin my life and become a parent, I would never give birth. She knows this. Yet she got mad because I talked about it. 

I can’t fucking wait to get sterilized at age 21 and show people the medical photos so they will never again tell me “You’ll change your mind when you’re older.” I’ll for sure get other bingos, but not that one. Is it asking too fucking much to have people respect you? When I see a pregnant woman I think to myself, “You poor thing. Why would you trap yourself in such an awful life and ruin everything for yourself?” BUT I DON’T TEL ANYONE.

Anyone else get weirded out when parents get defensive?,"Some relatives are visiting and they brought their 4-year-old. I’m a seamstress and keep a lot of scissors, needles, pins, etc in my room. The 4-year-old came to poke around (which I don’t mind at all - we never see these relatives) and she opened a bag with some scissors in them. I took the scissors out of the bag and gave the bag back, and her dad noticed I did this. He chimed in that “the kids have their own scissors at home” and it’s okay unless they’re “really sharp”.  These weren’t my sharpest pair, but god forbid she got cut and i would look like the asshole for letting a 4 year old play with seamstress scissors. It’s not about your kid’s common sense or your parenting, I don’t want to be responsible when your kid gets hurt from using my stuff. Because 4 year olds get hurt. In my eyes, it’s a safety issue and not something to have an ego over. If anything, I’m trying to help.

Tonight, all I had to do when I got home was grab a few of my things, throw car trash away, and relax from a 12 hr drive home with my hubs (2 or so hrs were added from various stops). 

How does it get any better than this? ♥️

"Coworker keeps getting bingoed, and I'm so mad on her behalf","I'm relatively new to Reddit (long time lurker, first time poster), so sorry anything about this play is.. bad. Also I'm on mobile, idk if that'll mess with formatting.

I started a new job about a month ago, and I guess one of my coworkers got married shortly before I joined. She came up to me yesterday to tell me two things: Don't ask her ""How's the married life?"" and don't ask when she's going to have kids. As far as the first question, I didn't know the wedding was recent enough to warrant that question, and for the second, fuck no. I told her that that isn't any of my business, and whether or not she chooses to have kids and why she makes either decision is also not my business.

She also told me that she can't get pregnant, or at least that doing so would be dangerous (endometriosis, what a drag), and also she doesn't want kids because the planet is messed up, finances aren't great, etc. Which are similar reasons to my own for not wanting a kid (in addition to dysphoria, can I get a wahoo from my trans masc peeps?).

Today we were talking about it because yet another coworker asked ""So are you trying for kids yet?"" I'm like, that's basically asking how often and what kind of sex are you having, which is so inappropriate, to which she responded that another coworker's wife had legitimately asked about her and her husband's sex life. I'm just so infuriated on her behalf.",childfree
What if someone had a child and then did not like them personality wise?,"I know it must happen.  people are born and aren't personality compatible with their parents.  yet, the parents still have to legally support them for the next 18 years even if they didn't like them as a person.

Get my tubes tied?,"For the past few years I have had this tentative plan that if I turn 35 and I'm not married, I would have my tubes tied. I'm ambivalent about having children but I know for sure that I don't want to have kids without a spouse if I do have them. I have been a high school coach in the past and enjoyed working with teenagers but the younger the kid is, the less I like them. 

My parents had me when they were about 20 and I was out of the house right after highschool. They were smart and I do not want to be 55 and still be raising a kid or have a kid in the house. 

So those are some of my thoughts/reasonings for wanting to get my tubes tied. Any other thoughts, opinions, or advice?",childfree
Got the lecture... (long rant),"(on mobile, sorry for the formatting) 

Due to many reasons, all my life I've never wanted biological children of my own.  I'm now 37 and happily married to a wonderful woman who also shares my view on children.  We both came from shitty family situations with crappy childhoods so, as selfish as it may sound, we just want to enjoy life with no kids for a while.  We agreed that if we **both** choose to ""have a kid"" together at some point we'll foster/adopt an older child who may not otherwise get the chance at a stable/happy life/family due to aging in the system.  I have a ""friend"" who I mainly go to the gym with who knows this.  - I also have a gym membership that allows for me to bring one guest with me every time I go, and I go at least 5 days a week sometimes multiple times a day.  (That becomes relevant later) 

So I've recently had the opportunity to persue my life goals and fix some things with myself over this past year.  I have lost about 60 pounds on Keto, gained a ton of muscle, am crazy active now, best health of my life, and have achieved an almost zen level of happiness I never thought possible in life.  Part of that change is that I've finally decided to get a vasectomy.  All my life I've been scared of having an ""oops"" baby so this is a logical next step in that regard on my ""path to greatness"".  I've always been chicken, but fk it, I have the opportunity atm so why not.

Well, this means I won't be taking my ""buddy"" to my gym for a week after my (now soon coming up) surgery.  I gave him a heads up, and since I'm not embarrassed about it, I was honest when he asked me why... I got the long hand on the shoulder ""bingo"" speech  on how the world would be such a better place for me if I had a kid... ...How I was missing out, making a huge mistake, etc, etc, etc.  He said he was just trying to be a good friend, and I guess on some level I could see that kind of twisted logic... ....BUT for the love of God HE JUST WOULD NOT LET UP ABOUT IT! 

I'm not an angry guy but I was completely disgusted and offended that another person would try to force their ""will"" on me like that.  It took everything in me to hold back the flames coming out of my eyes and remain calm.... Even after explaining again that this is something I've wanted since forever, he.  just.  kept.  going.  I let him know he is crossing a line and should stop talking about it with me.   (His final line was an ""I'll pray for you"" )   Bleh... I hate that shit. 

What makes people think that kind of verbal ass-hattery is ok?   Am I wrong in being disguested and feeling insulted?   I'd like to think I'm a fairly level headed, educated, grown ass adult capable of making big life decisions without getting brow beaten by a ""friend"".

How do you all handle crap like that?  I basically just started ""okaying"" him till he tired himself out talking in circles.

Pregnancy scare support?,"I had unprotected sex a week ago,. We’ve been doing the pull out method, dumb I know, and after he said he didn’t know if he pulled out in time. A lot of it was on the bed and I didn’t see any on or in me however now I’m super paranoid that I’m pregnant.

I was diagnosed with PCOS at 18 and was told I’d never be able to have kids as they caught it too late, I had never had a period until months after my diagnosis. I have one period a month now, I missed one earlier this year, my cycle days are irregular though. Sometimes it’s 40 days sometimes it’s less than 20. 

I have barely been able to sleep and I haven’t been able to have sex since. I took a test today and it came back negative, because it’s been a week and is too soon to tell. It helped a bit but how can I just calm down??  There’s literally nothing I can do about it for at least another week or two, so how can I make myself not worry?",childfree
I was that kid,"That time when I wandered through neighbours' yards on the regular, and was confronted by that one old man who got angry I was in his garden; 

I'm sorry old man, I was being an entitled asshole, I had no right to be in your garden, and you definitely didn't deserve to be whispered about amongst my friends as the mean, old, scary, angry man who lives in the yellow house.

That time I was visiting a relative in hospital, and I went into the tv-room (this was the 90's, rooms didn't have their own personal tv) and was really upset when a sick older lady didn't let me watch the kid's tv-show. You were probably feeling like shit, and your show was one of the nice things you got to look forward to, and there I came, expecting to be catered for, cause I was a Kiiiid. I'm so sorry.

Advice a mother gave me at the gym,"So I’m working the front desk at my gym. I’m busy getting the steam cleaner to go steam the bathroom floors when my coworker in the nursery asked me to go grab the little girls (6-7 YO) mother because the girl was crying. So I go into the aerobics room where the girls mother was exercising and I say “hey your kids crying. My coworker wanted me to grab you.” She goes “ugh! I am going to kill her (her kid not the coworker). I ask her why and she said “she’s been having separation anxiety and never wants to leave my side.” I said oh okay and I continued on. 
Well later I walk into the aerobics room to go clean the bathroom that is near it. The mother sees me and says “don’t ever have kids. It’s a trap!” Then she says “haha just kidding.” 
I laughed and said “oh I don’t want them anyway.”

Feel like I’m losing my mind,"
I’m 31(F) and have been childfree ever since I realized I had a choice. I don’t have a lot of female friends but the select few I had become friends with, we all had not wanting kids in common. 

EVERY.SINGLE.ONE of them now has a kid, or is pregnant. We all used to be the people on here and now they’ve all turned into what we hated. All their social media posts are about their kids, every day what Ashleigh Mikayleigh likes and doesn’t like for food, complaining about headaches from kids screaming for hours on end, how “cute” maternity clothes are, countdowns to giving birth, my one friend came super close to dying the first time she got pregnant and I thought that would be that but no now she’s pregnant again and I’m literally scared for her life every day. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. I miss my friends and feeling like I wasn’t judged for not wanting kids. They’re good and don’t bingo me, but I don’t talk to them hardly at all anymore.

 I want my friends back.

An empty uterus and a full stomach. Pretty much my ideal state.,"So, my dad is turning 56 in a few days. To celebrate, my family went to dinner together tonight. Afterwards, I was thinking about it, and I realized how amazing it was. I (29F) spent the night laughing with my parents  (married 34 years) and my brother (25M). The restaurant was upscale with not a child in sight. No crying. No tantrums. No kids menu. Just dozens of adults enjoying wine, steak, and the best creme brûlée I’ve ever had. 

And you know the best part? I could afford it. I ordered filet and lobster Mac and cheese and had an amazing time. Not once did I have to check in with a babysitter or worry about someone’s tuition. I just enjoyed a peaceful evening with my family. Now, I get to head home, change into my favorite comfy pj’s, and play video games with my dog in my lap. 

It’s pretty much a perfect Saturday. 😌",childfree

My story of becoming CF.,"Hi, i'm going through divorce, basicly my (ex)SO was fine being childfree at the start of our relationship and after 9years her urge to have child grew stronger each year to the point where she forced to me to choose between making a baby with her or breaking up.

All of this has made me think A LOT about having a baby, why i'm childfree and why i don't want one etc, and i feel like writing it down, share it and get feedback and thoughts.

So, my first thoughts about being childfree started VERY young, i was like under 10year old when i was first introduced to the thought i could potentially be parent in some distant future, and giving it a thought i used my parents as an example what was waiting for me, and the responsibility scared the shit out of me, i would be responsible of cleaning the house, feeding the child, ordering the child to do this and that and taking care of basicly everything, and it got me to the point where i thought how the heck i could get RID of the child if i ever got one(i'll save you from gringy story about why i thought i would be parent in the first place, because i didn't know about biology much at that age), and i felt super quilty about it and i knew it was thoughts i shouldn't have, since babies are potrayed as ""gifts"" and a good thing.

Growing and learning more, i then grew out from scare of responsibility about household, money, food etc, because those we're things i would have to take care of whatever i have a child or not, but the fear of responsibility switched to emotional responsibilities, i would have to teach and rise this child moral, good person. I would have to make him / her feel safe and loved, i would have to provide him / her things he / she needs to grow into complete, working good person, and i just know ( and i still know) that i can't provide all that, i have niece and i'm not intrested what she has to say, i'm not intrested when she plays with her toys, i don't care for changing diapers, feeding or any other activity one should do with a child, long story short, I would not be involved much in that child's life and i would be HORRIBLE father. I'm addicted to videogames(this means i would rather play videogames than play and get involved into child's life), i have bad habits (child would very likely take these habits as it learns them from me) etc.... And when i talk about this with my parents it is very difficult and awkward conversation, my mom says i would be EXCELLENT father, i'm just perfect father and i should definetly have child, and it hurts me a lot, and when i bring my objections they can't help but feel insulted, because my standards are so high what that child deserves they feel it's critisism towards them, so it's very difficult to talk with them about this subject, escpecially when my mother loves children.

Since everything revolves around families (TV, movies, signs, forums, social media etc...) and kids, i kept thinking this subject a LOT, i tried so hard to find reasons to have child, and why not to have child, so to make long story short, my conclusions from constant searhing is this : There is only 1 good reason to have a child, to have 1 more person involved in your life you can love, and who can potentially love you. Other than this, there is this HUGE list of why NOT have a child, biggest reasons for me is the emotional responsibility for the rest of your life for the child and being as good parent as you can possibly be for the child, and morality of the decision on making a child, life's been rough for me, i can't say i want life i've had for my child with all the suffering i have endured, so i conclusively made decision to NEVER have a child at around the age of 22.(and i don't want to disrespect anyone, i'm fully aware there are people who have endured way more suffering in their lives than i have, i'm simply speaking for myself.)

last year of my life has been hell for me, i think i have been depressed for a long time now, we got married a year ago with my (ex)SO, and i knew she had desire for a child, i asked her how can this possibly work if you want child, and i do not, and then i asked can she spend rest of her life without a child? She said yes, and since i think in a relationship you need to trust the other person or it's doomed, we got married, what did we get as gift from her parents ? A new car, farmer car, with lots of extra room for what exacly ? Yup, babies.... exept, they didn't say it out loud, followed by passive-aggressive pressuring me to have babies, she would occasionally come to me crying for hours that she wants babies, when my niece was visiting my parents, she would force the baby on my lap even if i told didn't want him, when we went shopping for food, she would drag me to baby cloth department and go ""aaawww, look at these"", and everytime i got mad about this pressuring she was acting dumb and saying she understands perfectly that she's never going to have a baby and that she was happy with just me and accepts me as i am.

so, as you can imagine, i was once again faced with this immense quilty feeling, what's wrong with me ? Why i don't want a child ? I'm being responsible she's not having a baby, and i'm holding her back, i several times told her even before we got married that we need to BREAK UP if she want's a baby, i basicly BEGGED her to make that decision because i can't possibly know what's going in her head, everytime she would come crying to me how important i was and that she's perfectly happy without a baby, i honestly cared about her wellbeing because i loved her, she was important for me and i NEVER wanted to be cause of her unhappiness.

I got the point where i gave several times a serious thought about making a baby JUST for her, so she could be happy, ignoring my own happiness, however it always followed this pattern : If i'm unhappy and depressed with a child, can she be happy ? If answer is Yes, then does she really love me ? If the answer is No, then what's the point making both of us unhappy ?

in the end, even if the break up was rough, and i'm hurt about her lies and promises to me, i think this divorce is a good thing because afterall, we both ended up being unhappy, and hopefully i can heal from this depression and find a TRUE CF SO, at this moment it just feels hopeless.

ps. I also hope she finds someone she deserves and makes a happy family with someone, i hope she can truly be happy, and i hope one day i can be too.",childfree
I feel like the people here would be good mentors,"Like the people who influence people growing up that don’t actually raise the kid but teach them life lessons that carry just as much weight as those taught by parents. Like that hypothetical uncle that taught you the meaning of life and where to find a purpose. I mean like coaches, teachers, and advisors. Feel free to tell me why I’m wrong.",childfree
I think I’m wavering....,"Okay so I have always been sure I wanted kids. I remember being in high school and have a serious chat with my friend that we wanted to be done having kids by the time we were 25 so ‘we weren’t old mums’ and then hitting 20 and going ‘...nope, that’s not happening in 5 years’. Because I was having too much fun being 20 and doing whatever the hell I wanted and barely taking care of myself let alone a child. 

Then I met my partner who was not super keen on the idea of kids and I as a very sure of myself 22 year old said, well buddy, marriage and kids before I’m 30, not into it, there’s the door. 

I’m 28 now and we are getting married next year after a long engagement (because I wanted to get braces while I still had a money to spend on myself. Ie. no kids). We are looking at houses to buy. We have no debt currently and even the mortgage will be WELL within our means to afford. I am having my dream wedding next year that we will pay for with cash. We just booked an amazing honeymoon (that again we can pay for right now with our savings). We’ve been on several overseas holidays both together and separately with friends over the last few years. We have a cockatiel we adore. My partner just got a promotion, I’ve been acting in a higher role for a year and interview next week to secure a permanent position at that level. It’s not guaranteed but I’m a good candidate. I play sport and do PT and go out to dinner with friends to fancy places and do wine tastings. I play video games for hours after work because I’m tired and that’s all I feel like doing. I. Am. So. Lucky. Literally living life on easy mode. 


So I’ve been thinking more and more, why the hell would I switch it to hard mode? Do I even like kids that much? I hate when kids are loud in public. I always used to tell myself, well my kids wouldn’t do that they’d be well behaved. Would they? I hate when kids are all sticky and snotty. I hate when they whine. My coworkers will tell me stories of waking up to their kid having diarrhoea all through their bed and having to clean it and he kid and rush to work.  Then in the next breath when I make a joke about ‘yeah, maybe not for me’ swear black and blue that it’s soooo worth it and kids are soooo much fun. You went to a caravan park for your last holiday mate. I went to Japan. 

New mothers never have any sick leave because kids in daycare are constantly sick. They are seen as unreliable by management as opposed to me who is seen as a workaholic (because I get to go home and DO NOTHING if I don’t feel like it, I don’t have to be on all the time so I can give my all at work).

I love alone time. I love travelling. I love the idea that my partner and I could with a bit of hustling have two houses fully paid off in the next 30-40 years, fat retirement accounts all while still going on trips every few years. I’m bad at housework. I hate doing laundry and ironing so do as little as I can get away with. Why would I want to do a whole extra persons! 

Lately it’s like, why did I want a kid again? 

Because it’s what you’re supposed to do? 

Because then I won’t be alone when I’m old? I’ll have my partner. Or friends. Or hell, my brothers kids. 

Because I need to make the decision soon because of my age and I don’t want to ‘miss out’?

Because it selfish not to?


Well, I’ve always been a bit selfish...",childfree
Kinda brutal tbh,"Long time lurker, first time poster here. Some background: I’m 33F, have a newer boyfriend who doesn’t want kids, and I have said most of my adult life that I don’t want any kids. I also look young for my age. Literally everyone tells me this, and they never believe me when I say how old I am. This will be relevant later.

I started a new job. All different ages of people work there. One day I was on break with two women who are older than me., probably by 10-15 years, maybe more. They were talking about their children and asked me when I was going to have children.

Me: I’m not having children.

Woman 1: You’ll change your mind! You’re young! (If I had a dollar every time I heard that one, etc.)

Me: Well, I’m already 33, so probably not.

Woman 2: You’re not 33!

I say nothing, I just nod. Why would I lie about how old I am?

Woman 1: By the time I was your age, I already had 3 young’uns! (I live in the Southern USA, that’s for real what she said.)

Woman 2: I loved being pregnant. The way the baby would kick would make me so happy! I just felt so at peace.

Me: Yeah, I’m ok. Maybe I would adopt. But I don’t want to ever be pregnant. (Because I don’t!)

Woman 1: You still have time. Just find you a man and make you a baby. (I’m bi, so maybe I’ll find a man? Or maybe not.)

Ok, fine, whatever, none of this is new. What childless person hasn’t heard all this shit after a certain age? I mean, I started hearing this 15 years ago and it never stopped.

Next day I was in the office with Woman 1, along with my boss and another person, and we were talking about my current boyfriend, who I just recently started seeing. Woman 1, in front of everyone, says she “didn’t know I was capable of love since I didn’t have any kids.”

I just said nothing, because my boss was there and I almost felt like crying. First off, pretty rude thing to say to a person, that they’re incapable of love. Second, I have a lot of love in my life. I’m very tight with my parents and sister, have a good boyfriend, great friends, and two cats that I spoil. Third, she doesn’t even know me. I could be unable to have children. She wouldn’t know. That just seemed like a real harsh thing to say to a person you know nothing about. Also, this took place at 7 am. I was kinda too tired to have a good comeback.

The thing is I like this woman before, but now I don’t talk to her unless it’s work-related. My boss and I talked about it later that day and she told me that she told the woman not to say anything like that again to me. I guess I must have looked upset. I got told if she did say something like that I should tell me boss immediately and she would be reprimanded.

I usually ignore what people say about me because IDGAF but this just pissed me off. Because I don’t want to have kids I’m incapable of love? F you. 

Also, the reason I look young is because I haven’t gotten pregnant! And I know this isn’t true for all women, obviously, but having children takes a toll on your body, and I haven’t, so that’s why people think I look 10 years younger than I am. End rant.",childfree
How much money would it take for you to babysit?,"So this happened many years ago, but I thought I’d share it here.  I was walking my dogs when a lady I didn’t recognise approached me.  Apparently she had seen me walking my dogs past her house often so felt that she sort of knew me?!  Anyway, she told me that she was desperate for a babysitter for that evening as she had been let down by her usual sitter.   It would only be for 3 hours and the pay was good.  I politely declined.  She looked a little put out and said that she would pay £30 for 3 hours babysitting two children (bear in mind that £30 back then was a LOT of money).  Again, I smiled and said “ no thank you”.    She started to panic and said £40.  No thank you.  £50. £60.  No thank you.  She seemed honestly shocked and in the end I laughed and explained that I wouldn’t do it no matter how much she offered me.  She just shook her head whilst looking at me as if I was mad and went indoors.   If she had offered me £1,000 I would still have said no, that’s how much I don’t want to be near children.

"A turn of phrase - stumbling across the right words to help someone understand, and a celebration of support between mother and (adult) son","I'm on the waiting list for my vasectomy (wuhoo!!) and since I've had a really good relationship with my mum for a fairly long time now, I thought it might be the considerate, respectful thing to do, to tell her that the thing I've been saying all these years about not wanting kids is about to become a surgery-induced certainty. I wouldn't have bothered if I thought she was going to be an asshole about it, and she wasn't.

Still, though, it was something that left her a little taken aback. That's fair enough, I guess. She didn't say anything even vaguely bad about me or my decision. But she was clearly feeling SOMEthing uncomfortable.

After while, she happened to say the words ""...I just don't really understand, it's something people only do once they've decided they've already had enough children"". And I (a person with no children) just replied with ""That's exactly what I've done."" And it seemed to click. She brightened right up at that, somehow.

No babies for me!,"Hey Fam! 

I wanted to share my story and hope everyone has the same experience as me. Since I was a child (around 6 I think), I KNEW I wasn't put on this earth to have children. I would tell people that I didn't want kids growing up and they would always reply ""oh ok well you will change your mind"". They never were harmful in their reply except my mom would tell me ""don't say that out loud, people will think you're weird"". I always rolled my eyes at this but she knew it wasn't my goal in life. I am 29 and I knew this was the year I was going to get fixed. I suffer from major depression and I know children would be a death sentence for me. Depression runs in my family so passing this horrible disease on or the risk of PPD isn't worth it. I didn't want to end up in a hairy situation and get an abortion in the future. I asked doctors in the past but they always said: ""I don't do that procedure for someone who is single and in their 20s"". Birth control pills made me super anxious and feel crazy so I stopped trying pills. I had the IUD for 7 months and bleed the entire time. Back in January, I started the process of finding a doctor who would be willing to do it. I used the doctor list in this sub (THANK YOU SO MUCH). The first doctor was hesitant but talked about clearing with insurance first. Well two weeks after my first appointment, my insurance changed and no longer covered that doctor. I was PISSED to say the least since I was not going to pay out of pocket for the surgery. I finally found another doctor with a 3-month wait and was listed on this sub. I was very surprised and grateful that I didn't receive any bingos :). She was like ""you're almost 30, I don't see any issues with it since you know what you want"". My insurance covered the tubal clips but not the full removal. I didn't mind since insurance completely covered the procedure (very happy with that).  I had the surgery in August and it was not bad at all. I was super sore the first week but I was extremely happy it was done. My doctor was a freakin wiz because I only had incisions in my belly button (zero scars) and a small line below my underwear line. Now when I see children, I actually appreciate and love them more! The anxiety is gone and I can have sex with no baby worries (use condoms because duh STDs). I told my friends and everyone has been extremely supportive. I really wanted it done this year with all the political stuff going on and never wanted to feel stuck in the future. For everyone who wants this done, don't give up on finding a good doctor. They are out there but you have to keep trying. I told my mom the week of my surgery through text""I'm getting my tubes clipped this week"". Her response ""oh you should cancel that appointment"" and I replied ""ok lol"" . We haven't talked about it since but whatever I have two sisters who can have the grandchildren :).",childfree
My mom is pressuring my brother to have children,"It drives me crazy because he is 29 years old and not planning on getting wed anytime soon. He’s not even decisive if he wants anything to do with kids. Whenever our mom and I visit him or vice versa, she repeatedly HAS to ask him if he's met his dream girl. If he ever mentions he’s seeing someone or interested in anyone, she always asks when he’s marrying and having kids with her. She already has three grandkids but I presume maybe she expects it to be more personal and significant since he’s her only bio kid? Either way, it always bothers me how she pressures him every chance she sees him and I wish I could talk to him about it. I always just keep my mouth shut since it’s none of my business, anyway. It just irritates me that she’s this way with him. She even tries convincing ME I’ll change my mind and makes fun of my deeply serious and committed decision not to have kids.",childfree
A short but sweet rant:People losing their identity after having a child,"You still need a life, meaning and identity regardless if you have children or not. I’m sick of when someone has a child and their whole identity is wrapped up this screaming, pooping and endlessly dull blob that I HAVE to think is cute. The kid smells, it looks the same as every baby (squashed potato), you look like death because you haven’t slept in years and have completely lost who YOU were! More often than not they never discover themselves again or I have already moved on before they do.",childfree
Just need some reassurance,"Hello, CF. I don't have many rational thoughts going through my head right now. My husband just broke the news to me that he's gay 2 weeks ago. We've been together for 10 years and I had no indication that we had drifted apart. I'm having a hard time accepting the fact that he'll replace me with another #1/person/soulmate. And I know I'm going to have trust issues in the future. I guess I just want to hear that there are good/honest/sweet/CF men out there still.

Can't Have Time Off With The Parents!?,"I recently requested to take Halloween off this year as my parents will be in town. Normally requesting time off is not much of an issue where I am currently employed. However, when I put in for time for Halloween, I  was met with a hard ""no"" because other people either aren't working or need to leave early to get home to their kids for trick or treating. In fact my supervisor then proceeds to ask me if I will come in early that day instead to cover for her since she will be out to be with her daughter for Halloween. Now I am clearly not against being with your kids on Halloween, but being that I am literally one of the only people in my front office without kids, I was definitely getting the short end of the stick in this situation. Unfortunately I need the job and can't get out of it. But it's so frustrating especially since my parents will only be here for a few days and I haven't seen them in months. Anyone else experience this in their work place? So over it!",childfree
My time is MY time!,"So earlier this week, I had lunch with a work-friend. Said friend recently got a new position at the company. It's an IT admin position and it requires him to be on call 24/7 it seems. 

I stated that I would never work a position like that. When I get home I throw my work badge into a closet and it stays there until the next day. 

He said ""But you don't have kids! You don't have any responsibilities!"" I was like fuuuuuuck that shit! Just because I don't have kids does not mean I want to give even MORE time to my employer than I already do! I hate working enough as it is and 40 hours is the max I will do.

Finally got my Bi-Salp at 22!,"Went into surgery yesterday. I’m still recovering but feeling great!!

I had to meet with a few doctors before finding someone willing to help me. But thanks to all the encouragement from this sub I finally found the right surgeon! I will be adding him to the list when I’m not on mobile:) 

I got to the hospital on time but my surgeon was caught up in another procedure so unfortunately I ended up waiting about 3 hours past my appointment time. That really sucked especially since I wasn’t allowed to eat or drink, and didn’t help my nerves. Actually going into the OR was kind of the scariest part, being hooked up to all the equipment (I’d never had surgery before). But they knocked me out quick and I didn’t wake up until I was in recovery.

Honestly? I wasn’t prepared for the amount of pain coming out of anesthesia. For whatever reason it wasn’t really mentioned in other people’s posts. Since my entire abdomen was sore—from, you know, cutting me open— I had some pain trying to take deep breaths. I felt like I had the worst stitch in my side and breathing through it made it worse. Even with painkillers it really sucked for a while. It was really hard for a few hours, I can’t lie. After getting home, I just trying to settle into bed, but that same pain would flare up if I had to get up to use the bathroom. 

It’s now the next day, and I’m feeling so much better. The most severe pain is gone, and I’m pretty much just taking ibuprofen. I had a sore throat yesterday, but today it’s better. I can eat/drink fine I just need to take it slowly. No bleeding either! I’m trying to stay as active as possible to relieve the gas pains. They’re no joke— definitely have some gas-x on hand and if possible, a warm compress/heating pad. 

I’m so relieved. I can finally throw out my birth control pills!! So excited to be fully recovered and able to get back to my life. If anyone has questions or would like an update in a couple days I’m happy to talk more!!",childfree

3 kids + plastic wrappers + dr office = chaos,"Went to the doctor today and was enjoying sitting in a peaceful waiting room for once when all of the sudden the door opens .... and in walks a grandma with 3 clingy children. The oldest was maybe 9, and they all had “cutesy” (aka revolting) names starting with R. They each get a mint from the jar on the main desk and the grandma tells them to go sit by the wall, which just so happens to be where I’m sitting. *cue eye roll* 

All was fine until they finished their mints. All 3 proceeded to start crinkling the plastic wrappers. It was insanely loud and distracting. (Just imagine those crinkle cat balls and you’ll know what I’m talking about). Grandma never tells them to stop. I meet eyes with another lady across from me and we share “the look”. Thankfully I was called back to a room and didn’t have to put up with this nonsense for too long. But seriously, you’d think the 9 year old would know better than that. Why don’t we have adult only clinics???",childfree
someone said I'll be old and alone without kids,"when I was younger, I wanted kids cause I mainly thought that's how I was supposed to feel. but as I got older, the more distant I became in wanting them. Out of everyone in my life, I think I'm the only person that looks into the BIG picture in raising a child. And I think of a new reason everyday not to have them. Basically it's just a responsibility I'm not ready for and probably will never be ready for. Give me a puppy everyday over a kid. I'm judged constantly cause I don't want them. I think to myself, I don't judge people for wanting them, so why? it's very frustrating, but since I've met someone I work with who has the same views as me on kids and I actually introduced me to this board, I've felt a lot better reading the posts cause I don't feel as alone. Yes, I do have a few buddies that don't want them and agree with me, but in other settings, I'm the only one with no kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I was talking with a group of people and I was talking about how bad my cycles are and I made a joke about taking everything out and someone I know asked me if I wanted kids. I said no not really and before I could say I possibly can't have them, she said, ""so, you just want to grow old and alone?"" I had no idea how to respond to that cause I was surprised by the comment. Honestly, it kinda hurt my feelings that she'd say that, but I texted my gf about it and she definitely made me feel better about it. if I wasn't so surprised by the comment, I could've said. I love my money and I love my freedom, I love my clean house and car, and I love my piece and quiet. I have plans and goals for my life and I don't need a brat getting in the way of that. having a kid has nothing to do with being alone. don't assume your kid is always going to be there. you can have 5 and still be alone. I know I will not be alone and that I'll be able to have a great life without them.

CHILDfree does not mean CAREfree!,"Ranty rant rant time. Someone I know uses the phrase Carefree Couples to describe childless couples (whether it was by choice or due to infertility) and it bugs the flip flop out of me. Everytime they say it, I respond with ""I'm not carefree just because I don't have kids. Kids aren't the only thing that can cause you to worry. Not having kids doesn't mean that you don't have a care in the world. Don't call me that."" To me it feels like they are being really rude, especially to infertile couples who WANT kids.

Non-existent baby’s health was not placed atop my own,"On mobile so sorry for formatting. 

I have been in the ER twice in the past two weeks. On both occasions I’ve had to have several procedures done, and both times, the staff asked me if there was any chance I might be pregnant. When I said no, they simply went along and gave me my x-ray or my medication. They didn’t ask me extra questions; they didn’t delay any treatment for a pregnancy test. Their priority was making making ME feel better. I’ve heard all the horror stories about how a lot of times medical staff will delay treatment to make sure there is no pregnancy, but I’m glad the staff at my hospital places the responsibility of pregnancy on the individual.

EDIT: thank you all for the well wishes! I truly appreciate them. I just wanted to clarify something. I understand why  medical professionals have to ask this question; they’re covering their ass and honestly I don’t mind if they ask this. What I wanted to rave about was the fact that their policy seems to be to take the patients’s answer at face value and not delay treatments for unnecessary pregnancy tests. I was grateful that I didn’t have to waste time trying to prove I wasn’t pregnant while I sat there in pain.",childfree

Office dynamics and token office mombie,"Okay, there's a rant below, but first I want to express my subreddit appreciation. I haven't been lurking long, but I can't help feeling grateful for all the posts here documenting people's personal experiences with being bingoed (new term for me) and dealing with the harassment about having children. 

I think I may be one of the older members of this sub, and I work in an office. The comments I get are about as obnoxious as you can imagine, about how one day I'll change my mind because someone's wife did, or how they're SO SURE I'm gonna be the next one to have a kid... You've all provided so many great comebacks and responses I plan to use, and I hope they'll be more effective than my usual sneering or recoiling. (I genuinely find it disgusting that people think they know me and can tell me how my life will turn out because I'm biologically female.)

Anyway... 

Of course, there has to be that super annoying first-time mom who only talks about her toddler, brings him to work to let him play with everyone's desk ornaments, and tells other parents-to-be how their wives should prepare and handle impending motherhood, as she's the expert. (She's even shared Google docs she prepared.) 

She's also been caught breast pumping in her cube before and was asked to go to the lactation room instead.

An interaction we had early on when she asked me my age and was stunned we were the same (33yo). I just shrugged it off, saying it's probably my lifting routine that keeps me young-looking... Though now that I think about it, not being an overbearing harpy helps too, I guess.

Now, I've begun chiming in when I feel she's overstayed her welcome in a neighboring cube. Whenever I hear her start talking about how to raise a female baby (Lots of pink! Cute clothes!), I turn around and make fun of her a little for being so obsessed with dressing girls in pink.

Exhibit A - 

Her: ""BELIEVE IT OR NOT I USED TO HATE PINK UNTIL I WAS IN MY TWENTIES."" - Caps lock because she had no inside voice and seems to be constantly yelling.

Me: ""Then why would you wish that on another baby?""

She has yet to give me a real answer. 

Exhibit B - 

Her: ""I WANT ANOTHER BABY BUT I'M WORRIED IT MIGHT BE A GIRL.""

Coworker: ""I thought you wanted a baby girl.""

Her: ""I DO BUT IF IT IS A GIRL, I CAN'T GIVE HER MY (toddler son's name)'S CLOTHES OR TOYS AS HAND-ME-DOWNS.""

Me: ""Why though? Babies don't know the difference..."" 

Her: ""YOU JUST CAN'T.""

Later that day he emailed me apologizing for being insensitive by saying “its my turn” and promising not to tell anyone. I thought that was very nice of him but Im pretty sure he thought i physically cant have babies lol",childfree
"""BECAUSE IT'S GROSS !!""","This is the story of how I first came out as CF, even though I was barely 13 and no one took me seriously. My step mom's cousin had just had her third child. A week before my 13th birthday, she along with her hubby and kids came to visit us. A lot of other relatives and friends were also there. As can be expected, they all started gushing over the infant. Some of the girls there were my age or even younger than me and even they took turns holding the baby. Their mothers kept going on and on about how it was good practice for them ( barf! )




 Then came the inevitable invitation for me to join the cooing frenzy. I reluctantly stood a few feet from the mom and said something like "" congrats. .....your baby's cute."" Then she got up and started walking towards me with the baby in her hands, obviously expecting me to hold it. The kid was fucking ugly and had fluids dripping from pretty much every orifice on its face. It was also bawling by now as it probably didn't like being passed around like that ( gee who would've thought! !!) Everyone else noticed my reluctance and commented on how shy I was in that sickeningly sweet tone. Then the mom noticed the disgusted expression on my face and asked "" why don't you want to hold him? "" I just blurted out "" because it's gross! !"" 


The scilence in the room was deafening. They all looked at me as though I had just said something like "" your baby would taste so good roasted on a spit and seasoned with garlic, paprika, black pepper "" One of them asked sarcastically if this is how I would treat my own kids and I replied that I will never have any. This was followed by gasps and snickers.  My dad,  sensing the sudden change in the atmosphere,  asked me to go to my room, something I was very happy to do.

rant about not wanting children.,"Just want to go on a fucking rant because it feels everyone around me loves kids. People will see a video of a toddler doing something and go awww my heart. Yet I just don't fucking feel anything? Is there something wrong with me lol? I feel no fucking emotion whatsoever. seeing happy families together makes me feel so fucking sick to my stomach partly because i know i will never have that ideal 'nuclear' family that we are always pressured to have. i just feel angry/

and also i truly cannot comprehend what goes through a woman's mind when she wants a child..like they know how fucking painful it is and are willing to put themselves through so much pain..for a fucking child? My mind is blown. maybe i'm negative but i just fucking see it as 9 months of hell. not to mention, childbirth fucking hurts. your body is never the fucking same again after you give birth. the possibility of my boobs going from perky to saggy. possibility of loose skin etc and just losing your fucking sleep. all the hard work i have spent on strengthening my body and muscles FOR YEARS and all of it would just be tossed in a bin after i give childbirth and would just set my fitness levels back tremendously. why do women think this is fucking worth it?

 sorry about all the swearing but i am just so fucking mad because i do not understand why women will put themselves through this hell. it makes me so depressed to think about also because i feel it's quite hard to find a man who doesn't eventually want to have kids. and every once in awhile i wonder 'but what if i should have a child? WHAT IF IM MISSING OUT?' and its just like a lingering fear of that. every day i just feel like there's this fucking pressure for women to have children. i remember ages back i was talking to an adult and he was like mothers are overprotective one day you will understand when you have your own kid. i said right back to him i do NOT plan on having any. and he said you will change your mind thats what we all say. like you would fucking know? YOURE A FUCKING GUY?  literally what a fucking cunt. ever since i was fucking eight i said to myself i dont want kids. fuck off i am now 23 and my hate for it has only increased. just sick of this constant bullshit that society puts on us where we have to eventually find someone to be happy and pop out kids.",childfree
Family Law is driving me insane!,"I'm sorry if this might come out as offhand, but I need to get this out of my chest otherwise I'll surely lose it.

So I'm preparing for an upcoming exam and I'm stuck at the Family Law part from the Civil Code. And I abosluely can't read any single line without feeling like my mind's going to burst and crawl out of my head.

Filiation, paternity and maternity presumption, possession of status, how filiation is established in the Court, what happens if there is a conflict between two men who claim to be fathers, culminating with my absolutely favorite one - the legal timeframe of conception. Then it comes the fight for custody, who gets the authority, what rights and obligations does the other parent have, his right to keep in touch with the underage child after divorce....

.... Someone please save me from this nightmare! I'm going insane!

And it has always been at least 3 multiple choice from this abhorious chapter in every single exam so far.

Here's an adage that had me see red: the woman's husband is presumed to be the father of the kid because the law presumes that the woman was faithful and the mother is always known as the filiation from mother is proved with the simple act of childbirth (the mother is always known, it's a joke that floates among the law students).

The Bingo that never fails to make me grateful.,"I’ve actually heard very few bingos, personally.  There is one, however, that makes me deeply grateful, not for what it is, but for how it makes me think.  

“How will you ever experience that kind of love in your life?”  

Bingos are rude.  They impose on the most private and intimate parts of our lives, but they do (completely unbeknownst to the people who cast them) give us an opportunity to reflect a bit, you know? 

When I hear that one or read it here, I stop and take a moment to think about the things that fill my life with love and joy - to the extent that I’ve never once thought to place that monumental responsibility on anyone but myself.  

So, what do you love?  What fills your life with the joy that parents think that you can never feel?  

I’ll go first:  

I love myself, really.  More specifically, I love the ability, health and well-being of my own body.  I love the curiosity of my own mind and it’s ability to dig into the infinite depths of art, wisdom, music and life.  I love sharing these things with my siblings and my husband.  It’s really simple, right?   I also love my dog.  Let’s not forget my dog.

"CF members of Reddit, do you find a continued sense of purpose and satisfaction with your lifestyle and decision to not have kids?","Hi everyone. I’m 22M and on the fence about having kids. Thought I’d reach out to some decidedly childfree people to get a different perspective. I get told all the time that I’ll “change my mind” about having kids when I’m older. Whenever I voice my concerns about kids, and maybe not wanting them, it’s like people don’t even recognize that as a choice. There’s definitely this underlying pressure to have kids. It’s as if the sole purpose of everyone in America is to have kids; and if they don’t, they’ll be unhappy for X, Y, and Z reasons. I don’t hate kids by any means. I respect people who want to have them (for the most part.) But I’m just not sure if I want to dive into that lifelong commitment. My folks talk about our childfree friends in a sad tone, as if they missed out on a huge chunk of life that was supposed to happen. 

As someone who is seriously considering the childfree life, I genuinely wonder:
for everyone who decided to not have children, do you ever have a sense of longing, or regret your decision? Alternatively, are you at peace with the choice you made? Do you find freedom, purpose and satisfaction in the lifestyle that you chose? Any feedback would be appreciated! Thank you so much!",childfree
A start,"I've been lurking on here for a while now and am finally getting the ball rolling on seeking out a Dr. to set me up for a vasectomy. I have not officially wanted kids for about the last 10 or so years (28 now), before that it was just something I never thought about. My main reasons for not wanting to have children are the cost of a child, respondibility of raising one, don't want to put a woman through that pain/suffering of pregnancy and the after effects, the negative effect it will have on the planet by helping to increase the population, and the potential to pass on a genetic disorder. I live in Flemington, NJ and found a Dr. that does in office vasectomies  after a prior consult appointment where he will ask me why I don't want children and what would I do if...bla, bla, bla. I would like to hear how a vasectomy has gone for the men who have already had one performed, did it fail after X time, how long did it take before you were shooting blanks, has it negatively effected your sex life or improved it?

Don't tell me my priorities.,"**Update**: Good Morning all, first thank you for the support. It really means a lot, and takes a weight off my shoulders. Honestly, I felt like I like I had an obligation. You guys helped clear that up.   


I spoke to my buddy this morning on his discord server, he saw that I was on and pinged me:

Friend: Hey dude, any update on whether or not you can watch ""son""?  
Me: Whats up man, can you talk right now over mic? 

\*hooks up\*

Me: Listen man, I can't watch ""son"", I've got too much going on to just bounce out in the middle of the day. Between the ""X"" this month,""Y"" next moth and ""Z"" around the corner I can't. ""A"" &amp; ""B"" are on their vacations, I need to be at work. 

Friend: Ah. Yeah man, I get it. That sucks dude, but OK thanks anyway. 

I wanted to follow up and say something along the lines of - ""Yeah man, sucks I can't watch your kid for free and enable you guys to kind of do what you want."" 

But honestly my fight isn't with him, it's with the wife. 

ENTER THE FUCKING WIFE. 

We have a group chat - for some reason, mainly it's her sharing shit and old memes. 

Her: Awww, Xjanko (She calls me by the nick name her son has given me, because my name is difficult to pronounce) ""son"" was so excited to see you. 

I can tell she's trying to leverage/emotionally manipulate me - and I prefer not to be rude.

Me: Yeah, that's too bad. I have more pressing matters to take care of at work. 

Her: Lol, if you say so. ""Son"" just wants to see you. 

I didn't respond. 

Surprisingly enough, my friend is suddenly too tired to go out tonight to celebrate another friend's birthday. 

I hate this shit. I feel for my friend, because I know he genuinely wanted to come and hang out with everyone, it's been a while since he's been able to. 

Any way, thanks again for the support guys.

I can't just leave fucking work to pick your child up from school and then watch him in the afternoon.

So my old mentor/good friend, his wife and son (3) recently moved to the area I work in. He is working in a different section of the organization that requires a lot of strange hours, and he's about a solid two hour drive from his home.

I am now a work center manager (thanks a lot to his guidance) and in a pretty senior position within my organization. Two of my guys are on leave, (honeymoon and well deserved vacation) - and I'm really running the show more hands on than usual.

Nothing exceedingly crazy, just requires me to be more actively engaged with the day to day than usual versus managing larger picture items for the longer term.

So my friend's wife wants to travel (I hope for work, but I *suspect* it's for fun disguised as work), and needs me to pick up their kid from school, and then watch him for about 2 hours in the middle of the afternoon for about 3 days in the middle of the work week.

I reply that I'll have to see, because the next month is super critical.

Holidays basically every one leaves, so anything that is not done/prepared before the major holiday- becomes a shit show rush to get done in the new year. Additionally there is critical work that has a hyper-sensitive window that may occur during that time. Said work takes about a year of orchestrating culminating in 3-5 days of intense activity.

Husband totally understands. No problem dude - get with me as soon as you can, so I can know.

Wife insists that the childcare situation is more important, and she needs to know now. I need to go talk to my higher ups to make sure I can take off in the middle of the work day to care for a child that is not mine.

*Slow your fucking role.*

It's not like we have a **major** audit from corporate coming up. (We do).

It's not like we have a major project entering completion phase that we've literally been working on since May 2018. (We do). Edit - To clarify this is literally the shining jewel of the organization with C-Suite and board level attention.

Doctor I work with says childfree and non-Christian people should work the holidays,"I work in an ER and very closely with doctors everyday, so I hear all their convos with each other. The holiday season is coming up, and last night I got to listen to a lovely rant from one of the doctors about the holiday work schedule. She said she does not want to work Christmas this year because of her kids. Okay, fine. But then she insists that the people that don't have kids at home or who aren't Christian should be the ones working the holidays. I'm sorry, what now? Because I don't have kids or kiss a bible's ass that means I have no business wanting Christmas off? I don't have any other relatives to see or things to do? I had to keep my mouth shut, but my god, I never thought the entitled mombie mentality could exist in somebody so educated.

Maybe if you want to guarantee having holidays off you should work in private practice and not in a damn ER that needs staffing 24/7. Just a thought. I should also add on that they get an incentive for working the holiday, while the PA's (which I'm not yet, but going into) don't. So take your extra money and shut your mouth.",childfree
Be fruitful and bare male children...,"I got engaged a while back and went to a celebratory dinner with my close lady friends. We ended up at a local dive bar where there were only two other patrons, both of which were older men. We chatted for a bit as one of them asked pretty inappropriate questions (‘are you wearing white to the wedding’ kind of questions) and he proceeds to tell me his marriage advice to be fruitful and bare male children. I just told him we’ve got it covered and already have a 6 year old who’s a big and handsome boy and proceeded to show him a photo of my cat.

I went to the Cleveland Natural History Museum on Thursday and while it wasn't swamped with little turd shooters, I did see quite a few there and found it strange that people would want to tote around a possible screech potato to a place where silence should absolutely be the golden rule.

My SO's coworker wants us to have kids so her kid has someone to play with,"Long time lurker, first time posting also, on mobile so please bear with me 


For context, my SO and I work at the same call center,different positions and different departments so I don't know this coworker personally at all. All I've heard about this coworker is awful though. She ruined a group trip cos she was being high maintenance and not wanting to compromise on  anything, sold a girl a locked phone for pretty much double what it was worth and refused to get it unlocked and is generally unpleasant. SO is not friends with her either and generally avoids talking to her. Both of us are EXTREMELY child free and would like to keep it that way because:


a. I'm terrified of pregnancy and passing on a bunch of bad genes 
b. My SO has very little patience for kids 
c. We're both nerds and would rather play/spend our time and hard earned money on video games and other assorted nerd shit 



His department had a seat change recently and apparently she has her own demon spawn and started asking my SO if we planned to have kids and going on and on about how we'd make the cutest baaaaaaabies (more context: we both have insanely curly hair) and it'd be a crime if we didn't have kids. Plus her kid needs someone to play with and in fact we shouldn't have just one kid, we should have A BUNCH of kids and they can all be her kids friends. Because he doesn't have friends currently. He kind of waved her off you know as any reasonable person would. 


But she just kept on and on and on. Harping on and on about how her kid could use some friends and our babies would be cute and they'd be their own little squad and basically going off on some strange fantas she's conconcted. My SO finally gets fed up and this happened :


SO: why are you so stuck on this? Me and spicychicknnugget don't want kids AT ALL 


Annoying Bitch: well my kid needs friends. You guys can give him friends 


SO: What about your friends? Don't they have kids? 


AB: -opens her mouth-


SO: Oh wait you don't have any, sorry I forgot my bad! Poor kid, he must have got that from you.

Human genetics is not the place for toddlers!,"Ok so I understand sitters and daycare can fall through, shit happens. And I imagine it can't be easy to be a parent and go to school. But human genetics class is not the place for your toddlers, even if they're behaving! 


So today there were 2 toddlers in genetics class. Today was the first day that I know of that one chick brought her kid, and the baby slept through class so whatever I don't care as long as it doesn't become a habit, shit happens. Today I s also the 3  Friday in a row that this other chick brought her toddler. She took her kid out when baby started to get fussy but this baby didn't sleep through class. She made toddler noises the whole time! At this point it's the third Friday bin a row shes brought this kid so I don't think she's even bothering to find childcare for the baby it's more like a ""look at my fuck trophy thing"". And honestly y'all its kind of pissing me off! I don't want to be that bitch if she genuinely cant find childcare for Friday's but she knew the schedule for this class when she signed up! It's not even a full hour!


It's honestly really distracting for me to be hearing baby noises coming from the back of the class, it fucks with my ADHD. And honestly it's doing her no favors either cause this is a hard class and she can't pay the attention she needs to cause she's tending to the kid!


At this point I figure if they can bring their kids I'm within my rights to bring my dog, she's about as well behaved as a toddler.",childfree
Slate | How Do I Tell My Mom I’m Not Having Kids?,,childfree
Having kids and then be controlling,"I was just reminded of two examples of controlling mums that I've met. (tldr) One controls her kids' diets and the other, who's a TEACHER at my old high school, didn't allow her daughter to pursue her major of choice for university. Read on for more.

The first mom is a friend of my mom's and years ago we went on an outing with other moms and their kids. This mom brought her son and daughter and they have lots of restrictions in their diets. This mom buys expensive gluten free, sugar free, no artificial coloring/sweetener, etc. stuff for her family. And while we were out and about someone brought chocolates to pass around and snack on. But her kids couldn't have them and I ate mine in guilt like I felt so sorry for them to not be able to enjoy this goodness. Now I wasn't sure of this diet of theirs was because they have certain health conditions that didn't allow them to eat certain foods or if it's imposed by the mom. And then not too long ago I was in the car with my mom and she talked about this friend and how her son is studying abroad which means he's in another country by himself. And my mom and her other mom friends were saying to this mom like ""if your son is alone how will you know he's following his diet? He can just go and eat whatever he wants"" and apparently the mom goes ""of course not there has to be rules"" and my mom says ""but of course we were thinking her son is finally free and he's gonna eat whatever he wants"".

Second mom is, yes, a teacher at me and my sister's old high school and her daughter goes there too and is good friends with my sister. She was a nice and reasonable teacher but then I heard from my sister that her friend (the teacher's daughter) wants to study communications or creative communications or something but her mom wants her to do psychology so that's what she went for. And I was wondering if any of her other friends and classmates confronted the teacher about it. And here we are. Me and my sister are both in the arts and not contributing to society amirite. I even changed majors one time and my parents were okay. And to think back to how our old school had events and invited university students and graduates to do talks to present to us different tertiary study options and career paths. But my sister still talks to her friend and from what I hear she sounds alright.

Sure these examples might be unnecessarily controlling but still I would not wanna have to tell my kids that they can't do this and they have to do that even regarding little things like doing chores or something let alone what they can and cannot eat and what they should study. And what if they have different beliefs and views that strongly opposes mine? Am I willing to just let it go? But yall know it. I won't have kids to have to worry about that.

"""Creating a kid is a living expression of love, that comes from two people being in love""","This was said to me in a conversation over why I don't want kids. It just amazes me how so many people get so caught up in the romantic fantasy they don't see reality. They make comments like ""oh you must not love your spouse enough."" or ""if the right man comes along you will be so in love you will want to have his babies."" Having children or not having them does not gauge my relationship with someone. In fact having more free time with my significant other is more important to me. Plus children can add a lot of stress which can lead to arguments etc.

So...onward. 
 
I'm (hopefully) about to graduate with my degree in nursing in December. I'm married for ... quite a few years. I am one of those who honestly does not *like* children. I never have. I think they're annoying and obnoxious. And stinky. 
 
Anyway, I'm getting older. I'm approaching 30 at this time. I'm starting to gain assets. I have no family other my SO. My mother is dying. My brother and sister ... may as well be dead.  
 
So I've thought about children. I feel I have things to offer the next generation. I'm healthy, soon to be not-poor, blah blah.  
 
Now, I have been 'childfree' since I was a kid - around 11-12. About as early as I realized what it meant.  
 
I've made half-ass comments to my SO 'IF we were to have a child' etc. Like MAYBE it won't be quite as horrible as I think it will be. And....almost all of his answer make me not want to have them even more. 
 
Random examples:
 
Him: If we have children, I'll just give them whatever I have even if they are shitty people. My aunt has a horrible drug addict daughter. My aunt has literally no money or anything at this and has basically been bailing her daughter out of jail for the past couple of decades. She still steals her things and pawns them. Then Aunt has to go get them out. She is raising her grandson because of it. At what point do you draw the line? Apparently mine is sooner than my SOs...and many others. 

Me: ??? I don't think so...... 

 Example 2: 
 Me: Ugh. What if I'm so tired after work that I don't want to deal with the kid? 
 
Him: It's okay! I'll take care of it while you are away.  

So...fuck spending time together?  
 
And apparently if we have children, he will stay home with them...Uh...okay.

Baby vs dog convo,"For starters, I live with my cousin and her husband (CH). They also have an adorable pug mix. CH is a cool dude and gave me a ride to uni this morning, so we struck up a conversation in the car. He was a little tired and disgruntled because doggo kept barking last night. She's a sweet little thing, but prone to getting anxious and barking at the slightest disturbance outside. He joked that it would be easier to deal with a kid crying than a dog's barking, but I pointed out that she only barked about 4 times and will settle after a minute or two if you calm her down. Babies, on the other hand, will cry at all times of night because of hunger and dirty nappies/diapers, or for no damn reason. They often cannot be consoled and cannot be left alone, which CH did acknowledge. Despite that, he still said if he had a kid he'd be set. Not exactly sure how he thought that when he knows kids are hard work and is already stressed a lot.

Cousin and CH don't have kids, but they like the idea of having some in a few years. I believe there was talk of CH being a SAHD because cousin earns more or something. They're good people, I reckon they'd be great parents, but I can't help thinking how their lives would change with a kid. CH is a good guy, but he gets stressed a lot. Also, the two of them like a tidy home. Cousin has a lot of decorative and breakable things in the house. Having a kid would definitely make cleanliness difficult. I'm split between mourning the likely destruction of their future possessions and fawning at the idea of a baby to cuddle, since I think most are pretty cute, especially when they haven't learned how to crawl yet.

I live downstairs, so I wouldn't have to deal with the kid full-time, but we joke a lot how doggo will have to share the attention, since she's a spoilt little lapdog. She often sits on our stomachs if we're lying down or slouching, and I reckon it's an attempt to squash any potential competitor.

Mom left her probably five year old in my fairly large store by herself to go to her car,"So I work at a decent sized retail store (not like Walmart or Target big, but still not small). A couple of weeks ago, a little girl, probably 5 or so, approaches me and says hi and starts talking to me about Christmas. I fake a smile and go along with it. I look around to see if a parent is in sight, and nope. There isn’t. No surprise there, negligent parents who don’t know how to watch after their damn kids are very common at this store unfortunately. I notice a woman at the register saying “I’m going to run to my car real fast” and leave, assuming she was going to get some money. Still no sign of a parent for this little girl. The woman came back about five minutes later and went to the register. After she checked out, the little girl just happened to be up at the front of the store and said momma when she saw the woman and they left together.

No regrets, it was miserable and painful the entire time, I could not do any kind of physical activity let alone have sex for 7 months because I constantly felt that piece of plastic poking me from the inside. And today, after I had it taken out, my GP asked me ""so what would you like to do next contraception-wise?""

 And I said ""Well I think either I will get my tubes tied, or my boyfriend will get a vasectomy (he is older than me and already had a kid in the past when he was really young)""

And the doctor who is usually super sweet and helpful instantly went into the mode of ""oh but you really don't want to do that, its a permanent procedure and someday you might change your mind!"" This went on for a good 5-10 minutes where I kept patiently repeating ""Nope, don't want kids. Not in the cards for us"" And she kept saying ""yes, but its a non-reversible decision and you'll probably change your mind""

3. Isn't that hella offensive to people who can't have kids but want them badly?

Entitled people freaking out cuz they're not allowed to see the moms baby right away 🙄,"So in short, my niece, let's call her Emily, is expecting a baby in February. Not my thing but whatever, as long as she's happy. However she's super protective, especially since the baby will be born during flu season. She's posted a lot about not touching or kissing strangers babies. (Which is good advice in general, its not your child why tf are you going up to strangers and kissing and touching THEIR baby?) 

So recently she posted a long rant about how she's upset she has to post this. In short, it'll just be her, the father and the baby in the hospital. No one is to visit. At home, a few select people can visit but they want to spend an undecided amount of time with just themselves and the baby. Which i can totally get and respect. She needs time to rest and adjust to bringing a baby home. (She is a first time mom if that explains the strict rules) 

Anyways, a lot of my family are supportive of her thankfully, however one person, lets call her Ruby (and apparently a few others off of social media) jumped on and said

Ruby: Hey Emily, don't you think that's super selfish of you? You're not going to let anyone around your baby until YOU decide? What about your family that loves the baby. Sounds like you need to grow up some more. 

Luckily, a ton of people retaliated back and said ""its her child, if anything, she should be selfish when it comes to taking care of the child"" which i totally agree with. 

The kicker? She doesn't even know this woman. This woman doesn't know Emily, but already feels an entitlement to her child.

I’m at my wit’s end. I need new friends.,"I’m 38F, married. Almost all my friends/peers have kids. If I ever want to hang out with them, it has to either be a very special occasion for them to go out, or I go to their house with a bottle of wine, wait for them to put the kids to bed, and we chat for a couple of hours before they tap out from the days exhaustion. Honestly, I don’t mind drinking wine with friends in a private home in my yoga pants. I do it at home with my husband all the time and it’s great. But I can’t fucking take it anymore. 
When I go over, their house is usually super gross from kids stuff. I CANNOT get a word in edgewise because as soon as I start trying to have a conversation with their mom (my friend) the kids start acting up- they interrupt a billion times with some stupid story or they purposely lash out for attention. Their parents don’t teach them to not interrupt and don’t correct their behavior, so in our conversations, we start and end the same stories over and over again because of the constant interruptions. I don’t know when it became unacceptable to discipline or teach kids manners, but anyway. 
Now the kicker is this: I’m perfectly happy in my own company. I don’t need to se my friends. I’m perfectly happy to go months without hanging out, and when I see my friends, I can pick up where we left off and continue being friends. I hold no grudges. So why do I go out of my way to go to my friends houses when they call me or text me to say “omg I want to see youuuuuu! Come over and let’s catch up!” So like an idiot, I go to them. I sympathize with them- I get that they are craving adult conversation and just want to decompress for a minute. But this is getting really fucking old. I cannot stand rude or badly behaved kids, loud noises, or cluttered messy surroundings- these are only some reasons I don’t have my own kids- so why do I go out of my way to hang out with people who do? I AM DONE. I’m gonna only be friends with old people from now on because at least if they do have kids, their kids are grown.",childfree
I'm a trans guy and my dad gets sad about all his kids being CF.,"My two sisters are on the fence, but they know that they're not ready for kids yet. None of us are above the age of 25, anyway, so it makes sense that we're all like ""No way, am I having kids."" We were all properly educated about sex (thank god) from an early age and we just... don't want to ruin our lives.

I'm trans, so if I ever got pregnant that would be an instant abortion matter, no ifs ands or buts. Either both of us are going, or just the microscopic bundle of cells. (Sorry to be dark about it, but it's the truth.) My current boyfriend is on the fence about kids, but we're literally both 19 and don't even want to think about marriage/babies/cohabitating/etc. at this point because it's ridiculous, we're still babies. However, I did tell him that I am vehemently against raising kids as I don't like them and want to live a happy life doing whatever I want. His response was, ""I always get what I want."" He may be right, but I'll fight for myself until I give in lmao.

My middle sister is so career driven she doesn't even have time for relationships, let alone kids. It's possible she might have them one day, but she sure won't be your average mom and will most likely have a stay-at-home partner.

My oldest sister is the most normal out of us, so I'm sure she's gonna have a kid at some point. She just doesn't want to admit it to herself  that she wants to live a normal life, and honestly a normal life is still a highly desirable life. She has a boyfriend she plans to marry, a house they bought together, a dog, lots of houseplants... She's got it going on haha.

So that's all the context! Now to the point of this: My dad gets so sad whenever the topic comes up. I feel really bad for him, honestly. But also, he was a pretty shit parent so I don't get too caught up. I'm just not sure how to deal with him, honestly. Like, my sisters and I all just want him to accept that we feel how we feel. We acknowledge that this could possibly maybe change one day, but we're not going to be rushing things. He always praises us for being smart and thoughtful and self-aware, but in the one case where we're genuinely just concerned about our futures and health and everything... he doesn't care.  What a trip.",childfree
Potential sterilization in the near-ish future.,"I've posted once before in this subreddit about getting over anxieties with getting a bi-salp and birth control, but I think I've been able to either move past that or wrap my head around it. Thank you to everyone who helped me then, and thank you to everyone in this subreddit; reading from here has helped me out a lot. \^\^

A couple weeks ago, I went into to get an IUD inserted. The doctor was awesome and the pap smear was the fastest and easiest of my LIFE, but immediately after she was done with that my body freaked out and began rejecting the speculum. I got nauseated and started crying for no apparent reason, so the doc got my hubby from the waiting room and let me calm down before we proceeded to try to get the IUD inserted. Unfortunately, I experienced the worst pain ever and had to stop before she could even get in to measure. I came to the realization that if that was just a fraction of the pain of childbirth, I NEVER want to go through that pain, and getting sterilized would be best for me. After she stopped, my tongue swelled up and I couldn't speak right for a good five minutes.

So now I have an appointment at the end of the month with another doc to talk about my options. I'm wanting a bi-salp and a possible ablation (especially since no longer going through periods sounds VERY VERY LOVELY), and I have done some research, but I'm wanting a little more info. Would it be best to talk to the doctor about the different options for sterilization? Or should I get all my info before I talk to them? I've heard and read a little bit about the sterilization binder - should I put one together before I go in?

Thank you all for your time. :)",childfree
"""you're going to die alone""","hello all. same person that posted about [my cool cousin who ""forgot"" to have children](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/dcqpgz/we_forgot_to_have_children/).

i thought i'd share about another CF person in my family, my great-aunt. i was thinking about her the other day and started feeling sentimental and poetic.

*""you're going to die alone""*

this is a bingo most of us hear a lot, or something similar - this idea that having children is the only way to have people by your side as you die.

my great-aunt never had children. her husband had some medical issues, and some people in my family speculated that may be the reason they never had any. i've also heard otherwise, in funny, side comments like ""you're the only kid your aunt likes."" 

she loved the idea of farm life, a self-proclaimed cowgirl and lover of John Wayne. her tiny home was adorned with many horse paintings and decor. she had horses when she was growing up. and when she lived in that smaller home with a smaller yard, she had dogs.

my great-uncle passed away when i was fairly young (10-12ish), and you'd never suspect anything changed with my great-aunt, after mourning. she was mega independent. she was the personification of that Shakespearean quote ""and *though she* be but *little*, *she* is fierce"" - standing at barely 5ft tall and never taking shit from anyone. she was feisty and inappropriate at times. she had a thriving social life. get-togethers were often held in her small house, and there was always lots of drinking! she traveled and went on cruises. she had always wanted to go to Ireland, and you better believe she got there. she held a job until the university she worked at had to pay her to retire.

*""you're going to die alone""*

there were some small changes that started happening, mainly she had a loss of appetite. nothing major, seemingly, until she gradually stopped eating altogether. the doctors insisted that everything was fine: ""she'll eat when she's hungry.""  we tried to get her to drink some vitamin shakes to keep her with some nutrients at least... but my small but hefty aunt slowly started getting smaller and smaller.

eventually (and too late) she was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. she was an otherwise healthy person, and i bet if it had been found earlier, even past age 70, she probably could have tried cancer treatment. but then, having lost so much weight from not eating... she was too weak to even stay awake most of the time.

it was hard on all of us (particularly to her sister, my grandma). we were very close to my aunt, both figuratively and literally - she lived next door. she was set up with home hospice care, just trying to keep her as comfortable as possible. but even at that time, she joked that she was sad she was asleep when the young, muscular male nurses had carried her in her house and didn't get to see them.

*""you're going to die alone""*

my great-aunt was surrounded by people who loved her when she died. and it wasn't just family. so many friends were there, almost every day. she lived a full life, loved fiercely, and was loved just as fiercely back.

*""you're going to die alone""*   
no, you won't.   
you have no idea how many lives you will touch, even without children.

don't let anyone try to tell you you'll die alone.

Shut Down BINGO at Work,"Was at work today and discussing a coworker's maternity leave.  The company is based in a state where she gets to take 6 weeks paid parental leave from our company, as well as an additional 6 weeks of temp. disability from the state.  I know a lot about this because I used to be involved in labor relations/rights education, so I was telling her she could take additional time if she so chose. 

I jokingly said to her ""I don't know why I store this information in my brain because I am never going to have children!"" and she responded with ""Hey, never say never. That's what I always thought, too!""

Before she could get any further I looked her straight in the eyes and said quietly, but sternly ""No, I am never having children.""

The mood changed pretty quickly so I tried to lighten it by saying ""I've got 3 dogs - senior dogs are the only little ones for me,"" but I ended up just walking away rather than have her press any further.  


She and I are about the same age, and I almost felt bad for her when she Bingo'd me, because it definitely sounded like this was an unplanned pregnancy, but I also wanted to make it clear that like...just because you have chosen this for yourself doesn't mean you get to project your choices onto me.",childfree
"""I welcome death if it means not having to spend another minute with you!"" A Parenting Story","Hello, fellow CFBCs.  Today we have a story of what it's like to be a parent.  Specifically a parent of a child who has been spoiled by its grandparents and taught nothing by its mother.

This is a long tale, but hopefully worth it.  Perhaps it will help some fencesitters make their choice.

**Warning for my fellow emetophobes**

Here we go.

Night before last, fiance was with at his parent's house.  They have fiance's sister and her kid living with them as well.  Fiance's sister was at work, so they asked Fiance if he wanted to ride with them to go pick her up.

Fiance took one look at the car, saw the Monster (sister's kid) inside, and said he'd stay home.

Fast forward a couple hours and three retellings of what happened while they were out...

They all left and picked up fiance's sister.  They needed to stop by the shops to get some drinks.  It is *ten minutes* until the store closes, and they want to be quick as to not annoy the employees.  Then...

""I WanNa gO iN!"" whines the Monster.

At first, his mom tells him no.  But since the Monster's grandmother is there, she ignores the ruling of Monster's mother and insists they bring him inside the store.

They get their drinks, but as they make their way to the front, the Monster starts his whining about wanting to go see the toys.  It's now FIVE minutes before the store closes, but the indulgent grandmother gives the Monster permission.

He spends the next eight to ten minutes deciding what he wants (because of course they'll buy him something).  The employees have locked the doors and turned out the lights.

The Monster picks out a toy gun, claims ""I wAnt tHis!""  Grandmother approves and takes the Monster to pay up front.

Within the time it takes for them to walk up there, the Monster has changed his mind.  ""I DON'T WANT IT NOW!""  he screams.

What does his grandmother do?  She takes the Monster back to the toys where he spends another 10 minutes deciding what he wants his grandmother to buy him, despite no previously made promise that he would have a toy purchased for him.  He gets two plastic trucks which are bought alongside the drinks the family needed.

As they are leaving the car park, they see all the lights go out in the store; shadows of hurried employees ready to go home.

As they're approaching the marked town 30 minutes from home, the Monster asks, ""Where's the gun?""  He is informed, carefully by his mother, that he said he didn't want the gun so they got him the trucks.

What happened next is the stuff of my personal nightmares. 

The Monster begins to shriek - loudly, forcefully, and angrily.  He yells at his grandmother that he hates her, slaps his mother who is in the back seat with him, and kicks the chair of his grandfather who just had back surgery.

He removes himself from his booster seat and squirms away from his mother when she tries to secure his considerable person by fastening him into a sitting position.

He picks up bottles and old food from the floor of the car and throws it at his grandparents who are in the front and driver seat.  The whole time his screaming is becoming more desperate.

As is usual for him when he has one of these fits, the Monster suddenly projects sick all over the car, primarily soaking his mother.  She yells at him to stop screaming; calm down.  He continues unabashed.

His grandparents plead with him to stop.  He refuses.

The events continue with my fiance as a first hand witness.

He's in the kitchen of the small house when the front door flies open.  The Monster stands there, covered in sick, screaming at the top of his swollen lungs.

He begins, once again, to be sick.  Behind him, in walks his mother, soaked in child juices.  After her are two frazzled, angry shells of people who, at this point, would rather not be called ""grandparents"" if it means avoiding all association with the stained, smelly, screaming Monster.

The Monster stares through his crusty eyes at my fiance.  My fiance shakes his head slowly.  For just a moment, the Monster is silent, searching my fiance's face for any sign of shock, pity, or anger.  But he breaks eye contact and continues to his and his mother's room, whimpering the whole way.

My fiance just stands there, now entertained.  He sees his sister enter her room and hears, ""Goddammit!  On the bed, too?!""  She comes back out after changing her clothes, now carrying soiled bedsheets.

The Monster is now wandering the house, ass naked.

Fiance goes to talk to his parents and the Monster starts up again.  His mother begs him to end his commotion.  When the Monster's grandfather goes to him, trying to speak in a calm voice as to de-escalate, the Monster picks up a full bottle of soda and hits his grandfather square between the eyes.  Immediately after, the Monster stomps the new toy he was given, shattering it to pieces.

He's yanked by the arm, pulled towards his room, and told by his grandfather, ""Don't you fucking dare move another muscle!""

But he does move.  The Monster gets up from his bed, grabs one of the toy guns already in his collection, and follows his mother, who now appears dead inside.  He points the gun at her, pulling the trigger, and screaming ""I'm gonna kill you!  I'm gonna kill you!""

She breaks.  She turns to the child she swore she wanted and screams, ""PLEASE do!  Please!  I welcome death if it means not having to spend another minute with you!  Get the fuck away from me!  I hate you!""

Half an hour later, after sulking in his room, the Monster comes out to the living room.  While his mother is cleaning out the car, the Monster pisses on the floor then blames the dog... who was outside the whole time.  The Monster is five years old... and house broken.



Parenthood isn't kisses and cuddles.  It's this shit right here.

TL;DR - Kid demands toys, screams when he gets the toy he wants, vomits all over the car and his mother, assaults his family, screams some more, vomits all over the house,  and assaults his grandfather.  His mom snaps and screams the line in the title.  Kid then pisses in the floor.",childfree
Does the pregnancy anxiety ever fade?,"So, within the last few months my partner and I have finally accepted that being CF isn't just a ""phase"" for us (as my family had tried to tell us oh so many times, joys) - it's a permanent outlook. Yay!

For quite a long time, I've been extremely anxious over the idea of getting pregnant. I know the rational answer to my fears is ""if I get pregnant, I'll just have an abortion"" - I've got no qualms about that. However, my anxious brain THEN moves onto ""what if you don't realise you're pregnant until it's too late??? What if you basically have to keep an unwanted child?!?!?!"" I get so so hyper-anxious about this, even more so now that I know I'm 100% CF.

All of this has been compounded by some contraceptive issues I've been having. My method of choice is the implant, which is supposed to last 3 years. But, after 2 years of having it, I've started having periods again, and the doctor thinks that maybe it's just stopped working A YEAR EARLY. Now I'm like... I can't even rely on contraception to keep me safe! Cue pregnancy anxiety x 100000000. 

Has anyone else been through this? Is it normal? How do you get past it? I'm freaking out over here!",childfree

"I talk to you sometimes, this makes us good friends and you owe me babysitting and financial assistance","I have this neighbor who used to work at a local drug store. I didn't know she was my neighbor until she mentioned it at the store. I never saw her outside, just at the store, and we never got together outside of the store or anything.

Flash forward a few years, she friended me on Facebook and sent me a message saying she heard my mom died. Very pleasant conversation on and off on Facebook for a few months and then she announced she was pregnant. My dad knew her husband and apparently he already had kids and didn't want any by her for a variety of reasons (like financial). Anyway, she started sending me photos of her sonogram and talking about her baby. I congratulated her (though I knew her husband wasn't happy) and generally started ignoring her messages along with her comments on Facebook. A month or so before the birth I get asked if I could throw a baby shower at my house and I decline. I then get invited to her baby shower and asked to bring food, which I declined too since I never go to showers and we're far from close friends.  Her baby is born, she announces it on Facebook then says she expects everyone she is Facebook friends with to babysit, AND bring her meals! I ignore her and she starts sending me a list telling me I am obligated to babysit and make a meal, AND buy her baby items. I ignore all of the messages and  I notice I am not seeing them anymore. Long story short she blocked me!

So basically she was hoping I would support her, though we were never close friends.",childfree
Met an inspiring childfree person by chance,"Having just switched insurance providers, I went to a new primary care doc. The physician assistant was a lovely woman just a little older than me, so probably in her mid/late 40s. She was taking my medical history and I told her about my bilateral salp. She was interested to hear that they choose to take the tubes out entirely now. 

Come to find out she had a tubal ligation at the age of 28. Had to move to a different state to get it done! She told me she'd not only been bingoed but criticized and disparaged for her choice not to have kids. ""You wouldn't believe the things I was called,"" she told me. Really hurt my heart, because I know the feeling. Even her siblings looked down on her decision. Luckily, she said, she had support from her mother. After EIGHT KIDS (!!), apparently her mom told her, ""Yeah, you don't need any."" 

We bonded a little about getting to do things that people with kids don't get to do. She ended the conversation with, ""If I had it to do all over again, I'd make the same choice."" Non-parents are out there ""in the wild,"" and it made my day knowing this very rested-looking and content woman didn't have time for regret, or for other people's bullshit.",childfree
This community gives me hope,"I have always felt deep in my heart I do not want kids. I have battled depression for almost 10 years now (24 currently) and my parents have instilled in my brain to always put my mental health first. Whether it is school, work, financially, or in a relationship I have always put other aspects of my life on the back burner to ensure my sanity. Because of this, I know I do not want kids in my future. Being a parent would be the most selfish decision. In a world as messed up as ours is, I cannot contribute to the problem of bring another child to the world with inferior genetics and a parent who does not love them. 

My hope always disappears when I find myself in the dating world. Maybe it's the area of the world I live (Midwestern US), maybe it's my bad luck, but I always run into women who want to raise big families. Sometimes I lose confidence that I will ever find a woman who wants to be CF with me and find that I, as an individual, without children, am enough. 

Coming to this community is a breath of fresh air. I realize how many people feel passionate about staying CF. I gain confidence that someday I will find that special someone who feels the same way I do; wanting to be happy the two of us and focus on our lives together as individuals. You guys are awesome.

I had a second vasectomy 2 weeks ago,"My first vasectomy went smoothly. I booked the surgery, arrived, got a few basic questions like ""are you sure?"", spent what felt like infinity on the table, took a taxi home. The first sperm test showed some dead cells, another one - zero sperm count. Fantastic.

A year passed, I went for another test, and the result showed some motile sperm cells. Not a lot - less than 1 million per milliliter, not enough to even inspect the physiology of the swimmers, but they were there. Thankfully, I was only getting into a relationship, otherwise I'd be in a full-blown panic. Within a month I did two more tests at other clinics, the result was always the same. I contacted the doctor, he basically said that there's no problem, he won't even agree to a consultation visit with me.

I picked another doctor, the very best according to hundreds of ratings on a very popular medical review resource, went on an appointment to discuss it. He couldn't palpate what exactly was wrong, said he's never seen anything like this, advised a re-vasectomy, which I did. If the first one took infinity, then this one was two infinities - he had to cut the ballsack twice in less than comfortable (for him, therefore for me too) places, and in the end put stitches. The anesthetic wore off at one point while he was stitching, so my experience was less than terrific. Afterwards, he said he cut higher and didn't see the colleague's work directly, but he suspects that the previous doc didn't remove part of the left vas to make reversal easier, and maybe didn't clauterize it well enough. This shitty ""care"" about me changing my mind cost me quite significant money and a lot of pain. The new doc said he removed roughly 1cm of the vas on both ends, and I forgot to confirm with my own eyes again. Just wanted it to end.

The recovery after the second surgery was a breeze, though. First one - ibuprofen, frozen peas, 2 weeks with the feeling of being kicked in the balls a bit, another week of uncomfortable walking. This one? 5 days in, basically the only thing bothering me was the stitches during movement. No painkillers, no aching. Obviously I didn't even try to lift anything heavy, and tried to minimize movement. Also, removing the stitches was terribly painful for some reason. Ejaculation felt weird a few times after the first surgery, and totally normal after this one.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story - dudes, don't forget your periodic tests. The experience of masturbating in a medical facility is awkward, but recanalizations happen. With the sperm count I had, I doubt I'd ever be able to get anyone pregnant, but it's risk nevertheless. And an unethical doctor might not only refuse the surgery, but also agree to it, and then slightly sabotage it.",childfree
Dilemma about staying in California vs leaving for Georgia,"This is childfree related, I promise.

This is the one time I wish I wasn't right,"So I made a random stop by my mom's house yesterday and bumped into a long time family friend who also used to be our neighbor until she moved a couple years ago. My mom was escorting her out the door as I made my way up the steps and when this woman saw me she instantly paused, stared at me for a few seconds, and then started bawling her eyes out. So I stand there confused the entire time while mom consoles her until her husband arrived around 3 minutes later to pick her up. 

I asked my mom what's the deal when we headed back inside and she told me that the lady's son (third child) died 2 years ago. While in college he was beaten, drugged, and gang raped by a group of guys at a party off campus. His family and friends were extremely supportive during this time, he received counseling, medical care and a lot of love and support from his family but the trauma was too much for him  and he committed suicide a few months afterwards. Of course I was horrified at this point because I kinda grew up with this guy and this is such a heartbreaking thing to happen to anyone. I  was also thinking that his mother must have had a random breakdown because she's still in a very fragile state but then my mom told me that right before I arrived, the lady asked her if I had any kids yet or if changed my mind about not having them. My mom told her no and then she told my mom that she hopes I never change my mind because the world is a horrible place and while she loves being a mother she'd rather her son never have been born than to come into this world and suffer at the end like he did. She also said that she regrets how she used to chastise me when I would tell her that I didn't want to bring a child into this world.

I was trying to call her today to give my condolences and to maybe talk a bit but her husband said she didn't want to talk to me so I guess I'll try at another time. Another sad thing about this is that she is genuinely an amazing mom, one of those people who are actually meant for motherhood. She used to tell me that I shouldn't allow fear to prevent me from experiencing the joys of motherhood and that she has no regrets but I'm guessing that has changed now and I really resent the fact that she had to come to that conclusion in such a drastic manner. My decision to remain childfree wasn't just made out of fear, it was also made out of compassion.

This mom and her child, who was somewhere between 10-12 had to stand because there wasn’t room for them to sit. The girl was whining that she was tired, and then she was swinging her body around by holding onto the handlebar. 

I’m by the window, and next to me is an older lady sitting and reading a book. The mom loudly asks me if I can stand. I was confused so I said: ‘What?’

‘Can you please stand? My child needs to sit.’

I looked at the girl, who was giving me this little smile, and then back at the mother. ‘No. She can stand.’

She proceeded to get very mad, and they got off in the next stop. 

It’s not my fault if the bus is full, it’s not my fault you can’t make your daughter behave in public. And lastly, if your daughter is healthy enough to stand, she can stand. Period.",childfree

When does it stop,"First time posting here, be kind. I will stand up for myself😄

So basically we had an insurance rep come to my work yesterday and we all had to sit with her and talk over the plans. Certain questions have to be asked like age, children, etc. I'm a 21F btw and have been with my SO for 3 years. We both are CF and have said if any day comes that we feel the need to inconvenience our lives, we will adopt a kid, not infant. So we are CF very hard, but know things/views can change are have discussed what to do if one day we do want them. I am 110% not carrying and growing a crotch goblin. I also have a hostile uterus due to touch scar tissue, I don't have viable uterine lining to hold an egg. I'm A okay with this. Anyways, the rep asks if I have any children, I say no thank god I don't want them. She says oh of course, you're young, you'll change your mind! I firmly stated that no, I will not. And she wouldn't stop with the come backs about how I'm young and everyone changes etc. So I shut her up real quick with I have a hostile uterus. 

Why do people feel the need to do this? Why can't people mind their own? And why is my worth as a woman based on children?! I am more than a baby maker. I don't think giving life is womens purpose. There are so many things I want to do in life and nothing fits with a kid. I like other people's children, sometimes, but I literally can't have my own and don't want my own. I always feel like an asshole for my comebacks, but I also feel insulted that people are so quick to railroad women when they don't want children. 

Also, your mind supposedly will change when you mature or whatever. But i always wanted to adopt when i was younger. Like from 5yo i said i would adopt and always had baby dolls that weren't white. Since I've been an adult and also grown up with a lot of siblings, i realize parents age hard and are exhausted mentally, emotionally, and financially. So, i DID change my mind. I HAVE thought about it. And i FIRMLY know i will never have any urge to carry a child. So why do people feel the need to tell me I'm wrong or spit out their comebacks. Like leave me alone dude, I'm good. How do I get people to understand? How can I shut them down? Does this become easier to deal with? TIA",childfree
“Never have kids...”,"So this happened about 2 years ago when me (23F) and my now ex-roommate (K, 22F) were looking for an apartment to move in to. We were waiting for a realtor to come unlock a property for us to view but she was running late, so we were just sitting in my car talking. Somehow the topic of children came up and I mentioned that I was planning to be CF. 

I’ve known that I want to be CF since I was in high school, possibly even before that. After telling her this, K of course tried to bingo me. She then went on to tell me how many kids she's planning on having, what genders she hopes they will be, why kids are so great etc. I told her my reasons for wanting to be CF (mostly saving money and just the fact that I have a general dislike of kids) but she kept on with the bingos.

The conversation continued until the realtor showed up, about 15-20 minutes late. She apologized to us profusely and explained how she needed to pick her daughter up from school and drop her off. K and I weren't bothered by her lateness and we assured her it was okay as we approached the front door of the property. The realtor is about to unlock the door when she turns, looks me in the eyes and says in an exasperated tone, ""Never have kids. Their life becomes your life and you never have time for anything anymore.""

The realtor turned back around to unlock the door while K and I just kind of looked at each other in shock (neither of us mentioned to the realtor the conversation we were having before she got there). Seeing the look on K's face was priceless as she seemed to be reevaluating all her life choices, and I just laughed at her as we walked into the property. 

I've never once doubted being CF but if that day ever comes I'll just think of that realtor and her words of wisdom.",childfree
[Rant] kids at my work today,"Small rant, I'm on mobile sorry if formatted wrong. 

I do okay with children, because they can be given back to their parents, and I like my niece and nephew as they're both around the age of ten. However, I'm trapped right now at work with both of my bosses children treating the office like a god damn play ground. It's loud, it's annoying and grating to my otherwise not feeling 100% this week (I don't get any PTO or sick leave so I'm working through it).

This literally just happened. One of them came in with one of those mixer straws used mostly for coffee. And tried to either take some from my mug or tried to squirt something into it as their finger was on one end. Thankfully I stopped them before they ruined my cup.

No grandkids?,"I was at a family gathering and overheard my mother discussing her lack of grandkids with her sister. 

Both of them had 3 children. My aunt has a gay son with no children and each of her other children have 2 each. 

My brothers and I do not have children. Two of us are married to women with adult children we did not raise. We have regular contact with them but more of a friendship.  Our parents have no contact with them. 

My aunt knows that my parents were terrible and we do not want children because we do not want to be shit parents. If I did have children,  I would not let them near my parents. I felt bad for my aunt sitting there, trying to be supportive but not able to say anything. I doubt any of us will tell them why we do not have children.",childfree
My friends call me a monster for not liking kids," Ok so I’m fairly young and babies and kids were never my cup of tea. Even as a child I revolted babies and I hated them. My mother said I would grow out of it, so far no good. I told one of my friends that I don’t like babies and they are rather not worth the effort.

He called me a monster and said, “ when you have a baby, instead of seeing love and happiness, you just see work.” And I agree with that statement. Babies are just work until they can do basic tasks on their own. Plus, they are high maintenance and you will most likely have 3 shitty wasted years on a human being that does nothing but shit, and cry. I’m sorry but babies are just annoying little buggers and I would get an abortion then have to take care of a child that will bring me temporary happiness.",childfree
Bingoed during a clinical rotation,"I can’t believe my ears right now guys. I’ve never been bingoed so hard before and I just had the longest conversation of my life.

I’m 20F and currently I’m in respiratory school. A guy working with one of my classmates was asking her about her two kids. Now she’s got two kids and they were talking for a couple minutes about it. 

A code call came overhead about an emergency in the delivery room. I mentioned that birth is brutal and it’s extremely dangerous and I knew I should’ve kept my mouth shut. 

This guys in his 50’s, got a wife and hella kids and he just goes off. He told me that whole life script bullshit about how there’s not going to be anybody to take care of me blah blah blah. I wanted to gag. He then goes into a spiel about how my generation is going to depopulate this earth and there’s not going to be anybody left in the next few generations. We’re the problem with the planet, not the people (like his parents) who pumped out NINE KIDS.  

I was adamant about it saying I will not put myself through that shit. I am NOT having kids. I grew up in a shit show of a family with no support or love or money. I don’t care about kids or babies, they suck. 

He just went on and on I thought I was going to explode. How does he think this is appropriate topic during for someone he doesn’t know? Why does he think that just because the news says so that I need to have kids???? I can’t.",childfree
My Mombie Facebook Friend...,"...has been tagging friends who she claims ""don't comment, like, or share enough photos of her kid.""

I've known her for a decade and a half and we were incredibly close in middle school and stayed in touch after she moved away in high school. She had a daughter last year, a baby, who for lack of better word, looks like Chris Farley. And the baby is an absolute brat. All the videos of this kid show her acting up and being a general nuisance. So I unfollowed her but kept her as a friend. I used to just blanket ""like"" all of her photos and move on. But having unfollowed her I stopped.

Apparently a bunch of other people unfollowed her as well. So now she's tagging everyone who unfollowed her so we have to see what she's been posting. I guess someone called her out on it because she posted a status on her wall about how ""if I've been tagging you on photos of me and The Potato it means I've noticed you haven't been liking or commenting on my photos so I'm making it easier on you since I guess you just haven't been seeing them. But why wouldn't you be seeing them? I mean, my page is public, and we're all still ""friends"" according to FB. So, now you guys can see the adorable photos of Baby and you can do what friends do and support me. Okaythanksbyeee!""

She tagged myself and about twenty-two other people to this post. When I got on the next day the post was gone and her friends list had decreased by more than forty people. I added myself to that number, bringing her to a nice even forty-two.

Tired of Parents Getting Special Treatment,"So at my job, we're not supposed to have our phones on us. I've had a manager call me out twice for it being in my pocket, even though other people have their phones on them all the time. 

I was talking to a co-worker about it yesterday, and he said he got permission from our GM to keep his phone on him because he has kids. ....SO WHAT?! The rest of us have family and people that we care about, so why can't we keep our phones? ""They can call the store if there's an emergency"". Yeah, so can your wife or whoever if something is wrong with your kids! My husband works in security, which depending on where he is, can be dangerous. By that same token, I should be able to keep my phone on me just in case, right?

 I'm tired of parents getting special treatment just because they chose to reproduce. You having kids doesn't make your life worth more than anybody else's.

Loneliness during later years,"Question to the wisest and oldest members of this sub.... Do you have fears/concerns of loneliness during your later years? If yes, how do you plan to deal with it? If no, why not?

My wife and I are happily childfree by choice since Apr 2015. I have a sister living minutes away and she has 3 kids (age 13 and under). My parents aged 72 and 65 live in my home country by themselves but come on vacation and spend few months in each of our homes. Overall, they haven't opposed our decision, haven't bingoed us ever and respond appropriately to bingos from other family members. My mom and I have had many healthy discussions about our decision during the first year or so and not so much the later years. A couple days ago, out of curiosity, I asked my mom if she is accepting of our decision or is actually convinced. To my surprise, she responded she was 25% convinced and 75% accepting. I was expecting it the other way around. 

She explained that she and my dad are reasonably old now and when they need a vacation, they are able to spend few months in my sister's place and spend time with their grandchildren. When they need a break from the noisy grand kids, they are able to come and enjoy the peace and quiet of my childfree home. Though she is accepting of my decision, she is still concerned/worried about my loneliness when I am their age or when one partner dies (sooner or later).

When parents can ruin friendly greetings...,"First time poster, apologies for mobile formatting...but another post reminded me of this situation from a couple months ago.

I am a primary school teacher, in a very large level six metro plan school, as a specialist teacher. This means that we have over 1000 children aged 5 to 11 in a low socio economic area and a team of teachers to teach additional subjects. This sort of position lends itself to predominantly female staff, who have or are intending to have many children.

I love being a primary school teacher, and then going home and enjoying my personal space with my partner, even at the age of 33 people will still believe I’m going to change. It boggles their minds that someone can love children, be a good teacher, and not want extra ones at home ruining their personal space and hobbies!

Cue grumpy music teacher with two young children: Morning

Me: Good morning!

Him: How are you?

Me: A bit tired, thank god it’s Friday right?

Him: You don’t know the MEANING of tired until you’re a parent!

Me: PAUSES...But I thought you asked how I was?

Him: THINKS... uh... yeah

Me: So I didn’t start a competition of tiredness, you asked how I was and I told you. I chose to not have children because I don’t want to be constantly tired. You either care how I am or you don’t. I’m a bit tired. How are YOU?

Him: BASHFUL... um... I’m a bit tired too.

Me: That’s no good, I hope you have a relaxing weekend!

Him: You too........ sorry.......

Why I don't date people with kids,"I've seen a huge influx on here of humorous stories where one of us matched on tinder/pof/etc and was met with a surprise single parent. This has inspired me to share my story, and it is not humorous. 

I am a 28 year old female. A few years ago, I decided to venture back into the dating world after getting over a breakup. I looked over the guys in my area on a dating app. As expected, I found very little people without kids, and most of the people with no kids were either 18 or said they wanted kids in the future. Hard pass. I stumbled across a man in his 30s who had one child and we hit off. This scared me. I had always said I would never date someone with kids. My logic was that breakups are heartbreaking enough. I love children and I would get attached. My heart wouldn't be able to take getting close to a kid and then being ripped away from them. However, I reasoned with myself. At my age, there was no way I would find someone the same age as me without kids. The only way to find someone without kids would be to date far younger than me, which I did not want to do. So, I gave the guy a chance. I will never make that mistake again. 

We eventually started dating. Things went great. He eventually made the decision to introduce me to his child. It went fantastically. I became close to his child, who was perfect. I was on great terms with his ex (the kids's mom). We planned a wedding. I knew being a stepmom was going to be in my future. My mom, who is forever upset about me being childfree, was happy at the prospect of becoming a step grandma. 

My world came crashing down on me when I discovered that he was cheating on me and we broke up. My fears came true, word for word. I was more upset about the kid than I was about the guy. This experience made me even more childfree. 

There were red flags. I am not innocent. There was one time we were heading out on a date, and he got a phone call. He rejected it without hesitation. I asked him about it, and he said, ""It's probably just (kid) wanting to talk to me."" I said so what if she just wants to talk to you. It's your job to talk to her. I insisted he call her back before we went in the restaurant. Ridiculous. This guy truly thought that talking on the phone with his kid for 5 minutes a week constituted being a parent. I feel sorry for her. Hopefully she has another, stronger figure to look up to in her life. I am just as guilty for putting up with that. 

I used to think that I could maybe date someone with kids if the kids were grown. I know better now. With grown kids comes grandkids. I want no part of it. I was initially correct; my heart can't take it. I've known I didn't want biological kids from a very young age, but this event helped shape me into becoming truly childfree. 

TL;DR: Dated a guy with a kid. Broke up. Was emotionally devastated from the loss of having said kid in my life. &lt;/3",childfree

My relationship with my mother was ruined over being CF.,"I feel like this is the most heartbroken I’ve ever been. I don’t even know what to do anymore.

My mother and I have always been close. I love her dearly. We did everything together, I told her everything. She respected all of my mental health problems and helped me through them. She helped financially support me when I needed an escape from an abusive ex’s house. She never bingo’d me when I told her I never wanted kids.

I really thought she respected that decision, especially since my two older siblings have kids (Brother has 3 – all girls. Sister has 2 – one of each).

I’m not 26 and have been married to my husband for over a year now. I had the day off of work on Monday and grabbed lunch with my mother. We got to the topic of my siblings’ kids (who I do love), and I was shocked when she ask me when my husband and I were going to have kids. I reiterated that it wasn’t in our life plans, and all of a sudden, it was like the past 10 years of bingos were coming all at once. Kids are a part of marriage. My husband doesn’t love me enough if he doesn’t want kids with me. How could I deprive her of more grandchildren? I’ll never know love if I don’t have a child. I’ll change my mind. I HAVE to change my mind.

I couldn’t even really argue back with her. I was so stunned that this was happening. She got so angry that I wasn’t going to have kids that she just picked up her things and left the restaurant we were at. I received a text later that said “don’t speak to me until you come to your senses.”

I responded saying “can we please talk about this more?” She didn’t answer.

It’s now Friday and I’m heartbroken. My mother won’t talk to me. My mother walked out of my life because of something that I thought we had an understanding in years ago. I can’t even be angry, I’m just hurt. I’ve cried so much over this. I miss my mom.

I think people seriously underestimate how easily kids annoy me,"I'm currently sitting on a train, and across the isle there's a little girl, maybe three years of age, with who I presume to be her grandmother. The kid seems very well behaved, although I assume it's partly because she's watching cartoons on a tablet.

Anyway, so whenever the name of the next stop is announced through the speakers, this kid just fucking has to repeat it. And it's not just her, every single kid around her age I've ever encountered on a train does the exact same thing. 

And it annoys me sooooooo much. If it were my kid, I would pretty soon find myself saying things like ""Shut the fuck up, we all heard the announcement, you don't have to repeat it like some fucking parrot"".

So like... if I get this easily annoyed by such a minor thing, how could anyone expect me to handle a child of my own??? Like my mind is so fucking weak when it comes to this stuff. No child deserves to have someone like me as their mother.

 I feel like this story would fit this sub. I want to get some advice.

I’ve come to terms that I want to live life for me and practice in medicine to help those in need. Kids and marriage aren’t really for me shrug

Now both my parents are religious, Father(Catholic) and Mother(Christian). But recently my mother has become a Pentecostal( aw shit). I have yet to tell my mom I don’t believe any of this hocus pocus bullshit that is christianity. I don’t have it in me to break her heart.

But when I told her I didn’t want kids, she broke down hard.

Mother: How could you do this to god, why do you reject his gift to you. This is a woman’s purpose, we have the power of life.

Me: I just don’t think I’ll be a good parent, I rather focus on helping the people that exist now. Plus there’s tons of women that can’t even have kids biologically.

Mother: Because those types of women were introduced early to evil. That’s why they can’t give life. Please reconsider, god wants what best for you.

I kinda just left afterwards, I was raised christian my entire life so apart of me somehow feels guilty about the situation. Should I be ?

Side note: I asked my dad why he never took us to a Catholic Church. He looked dead at me, and said “ I love you kids too much”.

10 years later, I finally understood what he meant.

Sooo somehow you having a child equates to me being miserable as well ???,"This little story happened a while ago but I still remember it like it was yesterday because I was so mad about it for days afterwards and I still get mad when I think about it.

Also disclaimer: non-native speaker and this is pretty long you’ve been warned.

Also also quick side note: in school we had these I guess quick pop quizzes were one student out of the entire class gets picked to do a few questions on the board and then gets a grade on that depending on how well he did. I hope everybody understands this ramble and now on to the story.

Once upon a time while I was still in school I had this math teacher who had just gotten back from her time off as a new mom. She took on our tenth grade math class again and everything seemed normal for a while. 
But then came the day on which I began to severely dislike this woman.

You see at my school there was this kind of unwritten rule that you were allowed to go up to your teacher at the beginning of the lesson and excuse yourself so that you wouldn’t have to take aforementioned pop quiz. Every teacher handled this differently. Some gave you one free pass, others three but this woman ? 

Well on this particular day I had gotten exactly one hour of sleep, was coming down with something and on top of that had to study for some kind of big upcoming test. Needless to say I felt and looked like shit and was more zombie than human. 

So I go up to her tell her everything and you know what that bitch says ?!
Well I have a 5 month year old at home and I get stressed and tired too but I can’t just excuse myself and not prepare my lessons for all of my classes so neither are you allowed to do that. You can’t just let your responsibilities slide like that.

My jaw was literally on the floor. This bitch honestly had the fucking nerve to compare herself, a grown up teacher with a husband a salary and a baby at home to a sixteen year old student. 
Like WHAT ?! 

Sadly I didn’t call her out on this because I was young and she was my teacher but looking back as a 22 year old I wish I had. 
Honestly the nerve of this woman, like just because you are apparently miserable now doesn’t mean you have to bring everyone else down and most of all you can’t start gatekeeping being tired or stressed you cunt!! 

Also thanks for being one of the countless reasons for me being childfree. If having a child makes you that petty that you have to take your anger out on teenagers than I want no part of that.

Do parents make lazy workers?,"I have read numerous threads on this sub where the subject it is a complaint about a coworker - who has a child/children - who does not pull their weight in the team/organisation.

I just wondered if this is more accurate than not?

As for my personal experience, last night I did a night shift at a nursing home where an \[unfriendly\] young mother of 3 barely got up off her arse when the call bells were ringing. She was glued to her phone practically the whole time. She looked up (when our other co-worker already had got up and walked some steps to go check the bell) and mildly said, ""Is that the call bell?"" Bitch, you're not deaf. I asked her how many shifts does she do a week. She said just 2. Well, thank fuck.

In my old job there were a total of 6 of us ladies working in a little place, on rotation, the only lady who ever made a fuss/was always late/messed around others with the rota, was the one with a 10 year old son.

I have a theory that parents see their parenting at home, ""work"" and therefore they feel they can ""slack off"" a little at ACTUAL paid work. What do you reckon?

I'm not really interested in a definitive answer, I just wanted to bitch and read others' experiences with coworkers if they would like to bitch! Thanks. :P",childfree
"Just because I present with a female meatsuit doesn't mean being nice to SOME small humans is ""the maternal nuturing instinct""","Not  sure this is actually a rant but was the closest thing....  


So I'm NB/GF but I'm driving a female meat vehicle cuz that's the one my existential ghost got printed for it on arrival (F,39).  I am fine with this, figure I got the flavour that has reduced risk of several nasty diseases, average better longevity, and basically lets me wear whatever the hell I like with minimal raising of eyebrows (well, beyond the usual when your regular daily look is ""goth RPG character"" but you know, still), despite the more complicated plumbing, and some social and cultural barriers and biases of different sorts that can be kind of a pain.  


Now the thing is, I don't want kids and I don't like them.  I don't hate them, or like them, any more or less than any other human.  I don't think they are in any way more or less special than anyone or another living thing.  I'm a case by case basis kinda person.  If I like you, and we get on (I'm super nerdy / geeky, love many fandoms and sciencing and all that goodness), then we're cool.   If I don't, well let's just leave each other be, you know?

Now I have some great non normative non life script friends, I'm lucky like that.  But I had a conversation recently and I ended up shooting one of them down, HARD, because this is something that keeps happening and it kind of pisses me off.  It goes like this:  I am seen by anyone being vaguely nice to a Smol Human (usually because they like dinosaurs or pokemon or something and I'm like ooo cool me too!), and suddenly this is interpreted as ""maternal / nurturing"" behaviour.  NO.IT.IS.NOT.

Now I'm not a monster - I'm not mean to kids I just have no inherent interest in them, 99% of them are loud, gross, annoying or frankly just boring.  I'm not maternal, I am utterly indifferent to Smol Humans (and most humans of any age or flavour, to be honest).  There are INDIVIDUAL humans I get along with or kinda like or actively enjoy the company of, to varying degrees.  Again, this has nothing to do with their chronological age, or their meatsuit, but instead the way their skull jelly works, and whether we get along or have common interests.

But: because I have a female meatsuit, being friendly to just ONE CHILD has ppl telling me ""oh you just naturally have that maternal / nurturing instinct"".   Just, NO.  Don't tell me who I am or how I feel, or what my motivations are.  Fuck off, you don't know shit.  I am behaving EXACTLY as I would if this were an adult - if they seem fun and interesting and not annoying, we are cool.  If not, I could not care less.  It's not nurture, it's whether or not I find their company interesting or worthwhile as an individual, not because I like kids or am maternal in some way.   Sure I'll be a crazy fun Aunt but only if I actually find that specific child fun and interesting.  If not, meh - go away, have fun somewhere else, cba.

I'm also a lecturer at a university, and my educating near-grown-ass-adults is STILL interpreted as ""maternal / parenting / nurturing"".  It's not.  I'm a massive nerd and I like learning and I like sharing that with people who also like learning.  It's literally that simple.  It pisses me off that this behaviour is universally interpreted that way because I'm biologically female, it's ""channelling your maternal instincts and nurturing the next generation"".

It's not a big deal, and it's not bingo-ing, I know, but goddamn it pisses me off sometimes and nothing I can say or do seems to get people to understand how weird and skewed as hell it is to try to crowbar me into your personal normative interpretations rather than, you now, JUST TAKE MY WORD.

Anyone else have this happen on the regular?

Not mature enough to decide you dont want kids but yet mature enough to have one?.. smh,"I have one friend who I can relate to, we both want a CF life shes 29 I'm 26F. She has a genetic condition and shes slowly seeing less and less, she might go blind and only time will tell. Her family has also a medical history of storkes and other conditions, she cant take hormonal birth control and she had an awful experience with IUDs. 

I have cancer and I'm going through chemo, I decided not to take any actions to make sure I can have children in the future and chemo might make that impossible anyways. That was the moment I realized I'm actually serious about being CF, I didnt care about those news. It was a relief to be honest. I have nothing against children they're just not for me. 

She's my only female friend who actually understands and fully supports my decision. If you look at our situations and medical history it would be obvious that we're both candidates to get our tubes tied. In my case doctors have been fully supportive in hers? Oh no... this poor woman had to hear every damn excuse in the book.  For example:

-but there are many blind women who have kids, you can do it. 

-we'd rather do that type of procedure once a woman has already had kids

-youre too young and many woman your age regret that decision once that get married

- but you're not married what if you're husband wants kids?

-youre too young you might change your mind 

Etc etc etc 

We had this long conversation yesterday about how stupid it actually is to tell someone ""you're not mature and experienced enough to know you dont want to have kids"" AS IF HAVING THEM REQUIRED LESS MATURITY!!!! Its such a HUGE deal to have a child!!! Its the biggest decision someone could make! But that requires no supervision, authorisation or conversation with a professional. A 14 year old can get pregnant and that's it, mature enough to have a baby. But an almost 30 year old woman is obviously not ready to decide she doesnt want to take on such a HUGE responsibility... oh the irony, oh the nonsense behind all of this is just incredible.",childfree
“You’re young you’ll change your mind”,"I’m younger (19f) but for most of my life I haven’t wanted kids. I don’t hate them and some of them are cute and adorable. But, it’s not something I want. 

Recently I’ve been having a lot of health problems. I’ve had to get 3 surgeries. One was to remove an ovarian cyst a little bigger then a base ball. During the surgery the found signs of endometriosis. Since my surgery in July I’ve had 2 other ovarian cysts burst. Which has been some of the most painful things I have ever experienced. 

I was talking with my sister who has a 2 y/o daughter (who is adorable) about how if I continue to have cyst I will try and get a hysterectomy.  Her response to me was “you are so young you will change your mind. You will want kids once you are older” “kids will be worth all this pain” and “no doctor would ever give someone a hysterectomy if they don’t have any kids”

It pissed me off and frustrated me because she basically said my feelings weren’t real and my  pain  and suffering isn’t valid. 

I don’t want kids for a long list of reasons, but my medical issues are definitely solidifying my feelings.",childfree

Lazy parents with lots of kids in public,"I can’t hate young kids. They are not developed enough to control what they do. They simply don’t see why they can’t do something annoying, and I completely understand that. Not all of them are wild and constantly misbehaving. 

But I absolutely can say I hate some of the things they do, and parents who make no effort to control them. I know you’ve been to a restaurant before where you saw a family with three or more toddlers and not a single one of them was sitting in a seat. No, they’re running around, in the way of waitresses and fellow patrons, or far across the restaurant, annoying people. The worst kids even try to talk with you at your table. Come get your fucking kid! I’m here to talk to my girlfriend or family or friend, not your child. I don’t love them as much as you do. I don’t think they’re cute.

Know what else? They’re not my problem.  I don’t have to “play along.” Guess who decided to have five kids? Yeah, so who is responsible for them? Not me. *“Have some sympathy, their parents are TIRED!”* Those parents wanted those kids, they got them. I don’t have to deal with their bullshit. They are simply lazy, ignorant, and inconsiderate.

This is kind of like when you see a parent letting their toddler walk freely in public. I don’t know about anyone else, but while I see why some parents would do that, it kind of pisses me off. If the toddler is too young to know where he’s going and just runs in every which direction causing you to run after him, don’t let him walk freely. That’s just stupid. Same goes if you are both in a crowded place and the toddler gets in everyone’s way. Hold his hand! Pick him the fuck up! Another instance where I won’t “play along.” Parents who allow their child to inconvenience others in the name of “having fun” or “teaching them to be independent” are also ignorant. Do that shit at home.",childfree
It sucks for my fur baby. It really does.,"I'm living with my best friend and her boyfriend, and they have a toddler. He constantly slaps, pokes, chases, and overall aggravates the hell out of my dog. She's a chihuahua, and as a dog who is an overall nervous babu, I hate what the toddler does to her. I've taken care of her for over three years, and I know how submissive and shy she can be - she can bark at a stranger, but won't bite unless she absolutely felt threatened.

Ever since I've moved in, he's been constantly bothering her, to the point where she snaps and snarls at him whenever he even looks at her. My bestie says that my dog needs to be punished whenever she bites her son, but I tell her that he needs to stop slapping my dog and she wouldn't do anything to bite him.

I'm a submissive person myself, so I try not to argue with her. Not to mention how I'm kinda not in any position to be arguing, since I'm living in her house. But even then, it's just infuriating how I get my ass chewed out for my dog when she's simply defending herself.

If her child would just calm the hell down and pet my dog like a calm and collected person for 5 damn seconds, maybe I'd feel better if he tried to get near her.

And I hate it when the son tries to hold her; he drops her like a hot potato since he isn't able to hold her correctly, and I worry that it will affect her brain in some sublime way, if not flat out aggressively.

My friends believes that I'm being overdramatic.

Now this is where I uncharacteristically call her a 'bitch' - how dare you say that I worry about my dog too much when she is literally being dropped on her head? If I ever purposely dropped her 8-month-old on his head, I'd be an abusive caretaker, and I'd be arrested and/or kicked out the house so fucking quick, I'd get whiplash.

Now I would never do that to any child of any age..... But the nerve of her to say that me caring for my dog is not on the same scale as taking care of her children....

That dog is *my* baby! Mine! I fed her, walked her, made sure she was safe from danger - she's a living creature, and my family promised to take care of her.

The only reason I'm in this situation is because I couldn't leave my dog. She was from an abusive family, and I made a silent promise to take care of her.... She's kinda become a sort of emotional support animal for me, so I can't see myself parting with her unless she died.

But my friend doesn't like dogs, so she hated it when I 'coddle' and hold her in my arms. So? Many people hold their dogs if they're small enough. She's a fucking 'lap dog'.... The whole name speaks for itself.....

So sorry that I put my dog's physical needs slightly above her child's feelings.

So long story short - I'm just pissed that I can't show my dog any of the typical affection that I used to show to her, unless everyone has left the house for work or otherwise. And that I can't seem to get her damn child to be gentle to my dog, after a fucking year of this shit.",childfree

"I'm Apparently ""Awful"" for not Wanting to Date Someone with Kids","I (20f) was on tinder a while ago and matched with a couple who was looking for a third. Nothing in their bio suggested anything weird and my bio very clearly states that I'm asexual so I was moderately confident they weren't talking to me just for a threesome like a lot of poly couples on tinder seem to do. 

So me and the girl were talking, just trying to get to know each other and we seemed to be vibing pretty well. They were both a couple years older than me but that didn't bother me any and it didn't seem to bother them either. After a couple of hours I asked about her hobbies and she hits me with ""Well, I have a toddler so pretty much all of my time is spent on her!""

I was floored! Her bio had said nothing about her having a kid and I really don't want to be romantically involved with someone who has kids. As nicely as I could I said, ""Hey, so you mentioned that you have kids and kids aren't really my scene so..."" Because I didn't just want to ghost her out of nowhere.

She responded saying that she keeps her private life separate from her kid and it's not like I would ever meet her ""But yeah that's a pretty awful thing to say tbh."" She followed it up by saying I should unmatch her if it was that big of a deal(Gladly thanks!).

Idk, a lot of this confuses me. First of all the end goal of any relationship, even a poly one, in my opinion is to share a life with another person, so how does she think she can keep her kid separate from that. That whole thing stunk of her expecting something from me that I very much did not want. Second how on Earth does this woman have enough time on her hands to want to have not one but two romantic partners if she has a toddler at home?

I really didn't appreciate being called awful for not wanting to date someone with a kids either tbh. I don't know many people my age, cf  or not who would be comfortable with that.",childfree
"Accepting a job at a daycare, can I explain my side to you all as some people I’ve told don’t understand..","I don’t hate kids. Quite frankly I think they’re just small underdeveloped humans who require constant fucking attention and care. 

Helllllll no I don’t want to have the responsibility of a mother. I have MS (lots of fatigue pain depression) and I like my alone time. Wouldn’t get that with a child. I like my body. I don’t want to have anything go through me that would tear me apart from the inside and make me vomit and kick me from inside. I don’t want to be in charge of setting an entire identity and spirit up for a good life in this world.

That said, kids can be cool. I like hanging out with them I guess. Not as an adult who’s there to tell them what to do and when, but as an adult who can relate to them on different things and help them through challenges. 

Kids are this mirror into a world adults have forgotten now that we’re tied down by all the stress. I don’t know what happened to us adults, but the young ones really are so easily excited about things. And watching them learn to do simple things that we take for granted is beyond special to experience. I liked helping elementary kids in my old job with writing and spelling and watching them slowly get it. I loved helping them work on self awareness and help them learn to seek coping skills or help when needed.

I formerly worked for a year with kids elementary age and then high school with behavioral and mental health issues. The burnout got to me.

But now I’m trying again to help where I can with people. I’m going to be accepting a job as an Ed Tech III in a daycare with little kids, like 2-7 years old. I can’t say I’m 100% sure this is the best job for me, but it’s definitely better than where I’m at and something that will make me feel good and hopefully help others.

Please get out of my house...,"So, my living situation has sucked major dick since mid-May.  My middle brother, my SIL, and their now three-year-old are staying with my family because they moved across the country, as we did last summer, and as of yet don't have their own house.  They *did* have one they were getting all the paperwork and such done for the last week or two, but my brother did something stupid and now they probably aren't getting that house, but that's a whole other story that I can't be arsed to get into.

Those who have seen me around here enough may remember that I'm disabled and therefore still live with my parents, and that our house is divided into an upstairs and downstairs apartment.  I live downstairs with my youngest brother, we pay rent and contribute in other ways as well, so no, we are not freeloading, in case anyone wonders.

Brother, SIL, and nephew are living upstairs with my parents right now, until they can get a house of their own.  Brother and SIL are fine, but my nephew is driving me up the fucking wall.  He is constantly yelling, stomping, and playing with his hockey stick in the hallway upstairs (my parents are fine with this, but he's *only* allowed to do that in the hallway since there's nothing there he can damage or break).  Their living room is right above my bedroom, so whenever the kid is running around there, guess what I'm hearing for the next six or more hours.

If you guessed *STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP*, congratulations, you're right.  This house has absolutely no carpeting either, it's all hardwood flooring, so there's nothing to muffle the noise.

This would be bad enough if I didn't also have a severe anxiety disorder and misophonia to go along with it.  So the yelling sets off the latter, which feeds into the former, and the constant stomping and bashing makes it all that much worse.  Several times recently, I've had to text my mother upstairs to ask if the kid can be quieted because he's going to end up inducing a panic attack.  I was legitimately in tears for one of those instances because I just could not handle it.  This shit is constant, every day, until he goes to bed.  He's also at that stage where children are always acting like little assholes, so he's rude and defiant and yells/cries/fake cries when there are consequences for his behaviour, which is always.  You would think he would learn that yes, doing that same thing you just got put in your room for is, in fact, going to get you put in there again, but nope.  Clearly three-year-olds have the mental capacity of a goldfish, and the goldfish wants it back.

I'm not looking for advice or anything, there's nothing that can really be done about the situation right now.  Just wanted to bitch a little to people who understand.

Old church friend is pregnant with her 4th; mom bingos me HARD,"So I'm spending some time with my mom in the family room and I find out that an old friend from church is pregnant with her 4th.

She stays home with the kids while the husband works 70+ hours to support them.

My mom then bingoes me, asking me when I'll give her grandchildren, as 4 is not enough for her. I legit said no. She said I need to find a nice, white guy, we're black, to have children with. **FUCK TO THE NO.** I'll end up lonely in my old age, I'll be trapped in a nursing home, etc., etc.

I feel so bad for the teachers (or honestly anyone) that have to deal with this mom,"Buckle up buttercup, we’re goin on a ride. 

So today was the first day I helped out at an after school program. Everything’s going fine the first 15 minutes. Kids seem alright (I am totally cool with kids, I’d have some if shit wasn’t so fucked)  and everything is going how it should. 

Well, play time is over (literally and figuratively.) The kids begin to line up so we can go to a different area for other activities. But apparently one kid (Shit Starter) really pissed off another (Sassafras) so Sassafras ran away yelling “I hate Shit Starter!) The other person running the program (Baby Angel) had the other kids. So I look at her and say I’ll take care of it. I am running after Sass and finally Sass slows down. I’m thinking awesome, cool we can go back. Oh no honey, buckle up. As I close in, Sass starts RUNNING AWAY AGAIN. 

I’m questioning life right now, fucking chasing this kid down. Sass slows down. I slow down too. Nope, too close. Ladies and gents, we play this game for a bit until I’m like fuck it, I can sprint decent enough. So I go 1000% at Sass. I catch up to Sass and hold them by their wrist because ya know, they’re still trying to run away from me. I try negotiating-I say we can sit and chill out here for a second. We can sit at the playground. You can go home. Either way though, we gotta get moving back to school. We go back and forth for a bit but tSass finally concedes and we walk back. 

So I’m trying to still talk with the kid a little. Trying to cheer them up. Making sure they don’t feel like their feelings are invalid. I’m not trying to yell at or be an asshole to the kid. Instead I’m all like “it’s okay you’re mad at Shit Starter, it’s okay you’re mad at me. But I think you’ll really enjoy doing the activity we have planned blah blah blah.” Nope, Sass literally plugs their ears. I’m like OKAY whatever as long as you’re back to school. 

We get back and eventually Sass settles back in. We keep trying to keep the activities going. Defusing situations here and there, overall just normal stuff when watching kids those ages. Nothing major. So the program is nearing over (Sass is still pissed at me) and we figure out which one is her mom. 

Since I dealt with the situation primarily, I tell her mom. I explain there was an incident, had to chase her kid, how I tried to explain to Sass that its a safety thing and she can’t run away from people like that, we’re not mad or anything and we don’t want Sass in trouble, and that we just want to keep Sass safe. I’m trying to be neutral and not seem accusatory. 

The first thing out of her mouth is “and why wasn’t I called?” I was kinda dumbfounded. Like sure yeah, she’s got a point. But idk I honestly feel like what I did was fine. I told her as soon as she arrived. Kept her kid safe. Kept the program running. Fed the kids. Like we weren’t chilling, we were watching the kids and running the program. We do call for emergencies and when we have to administer medicine. 

But also, Sass was literally the FIRST TO EVER RUN AWAY. First of hundreds of kids that have done this program. My executive director has kids and she was okay with what I did. I had to actually correct her and inform her that according to that mom, how I handled it was still not enough. 

Like I said, I feel so bad for all the poor teachers that have to deal with this woman. If this is any glimpse into how she treats people that try to educate/entertain/take care of her kids (all while making like no money), good lord. We used to think Sasses sass was funny, and now we see it in a whole new light. She’s not trying to be funny, she’s just imitating her mom.

My girlfriend of two years ended things today because she wants kids and I don't,"I don't know how to feel. I told her from day one that kids weren't something I had planned for in life and she was totally on board. The past 2 years have been some of the best years of my life and the fact that it's all coming to an end is heartbreaking. I don't know exactly what caused her to change her mind, but this is one of those situations where it's unfair to either of us to compromise. The worst part is, she doesn't even want to have them for another 6-8 years (for context, I'm 24, she's 20). It just hurts, knowing that we have to end something so perfect for a scenario that won't even take place  in the near future. I have my reasons for wanting to be child-free which she totally understands, but nonetheless, something has changed her desires in life. I hoped that her love for me would overcome her desire to have kids, but it doesn't appear that's the case. There's a big part of me that thinks that I may change my mind about it one day, but I realize that isn't fair to her at all. She'd make a great mom and no part of me wants to hold her back from that. Obviously, I wouldn't have a child with her unless I was 100% certain and there's no way I can say for certain that I ever will. I can say though, that at this point in my life, my number one focus was on myself (and her).

Does this count as getting bingoed?,"TLDR: I saw an old coworker who had a baby earlier this year and I ended up mentioning that I don't want kids but then I lied about being open to adopting and I don't know why I lied. 

A little backstory: I used to work at a bank and I became pretty good friends with one of my coworkers. She's around 10 years older than me and married. She's always wanted kids but had a hard time getting pregnant. So finally she does and everyone is super excited for her. I am too especially because I know how badly she wanted this. So earlier this year, she had her baby and went on maternity leave. I ended up quitting the job less than a month later for personal reasons so I didn't get to see her after that. I did stop by once about 3 months later but she wasn't back yet.

So recently I went to visit and she was back and happy to see me. It was pretty slow at the bank so we chilled and talked for like 45 minutes. I had to remind myself to ask about her baby because that's the polite thing to do when someone has a kid even though I don't really care (not in a mean way but I just don't find babies very interesting). She showed me some pictures and said a bunch of cheesy stuff about how this is exactly where she wanted to be in life (nice job, great husband, and a baby) and she couldn't be happier. That's great and I'm genuinely happy for her. 

She didn't specifically ask me if I wanted kids but I guess she was implying it. Like how moms say something about ""when it's yours"" or whatever. So I pretty much told her no way, I'm never having kids and she asked me why. I gave my reasons, mainly pregnancy freaks me out. Like I get uncomfortable just looking at pregnant bellies nonetheless touching them. So the idea of me being pregnant grosses me out. I also mentioned how I'd probably be an awful mother since I have zero patience for kids and no maternal instinct. 

She seemed kinda sad about it but it didn't seem like she was necessarily judging me (another coworker who happens to be one of her closest friends is probably CF and she never seemed to judge her). Still, I suddenly felt a bit self-conscious about it so I quickly made up some BS about being willing to adopt maybe one day. I tried to emphasize how unlikely (impossible) that is but she latched on to the idea and looked a little relieved. I'm definitely not willing to adopt since I don't want kids biological or otherwise but I kinda felt the need to reassure her that I'm not totally going against the LifeScript. Everything after that was fine and we went on to talk about other stuff. Overall it was really nice seeing her again.

I just don't really know why I felt the need to reassure her like that. I know I don't want kids. I know that stuff I said about maybe adopting was a straight-up lie. I'm fairly certain she's not the type to judge me or anything. She didn't even tell me I'd regret it or that I'll change my mind one day. It's not like I've never told anyone about not wanting kids. I've mentioned it before to my friends and parents but I guess no one has ever really asked me why before.",childfree
My battle for a vasectomy - Advice?,"I'm a 24 year old Bisexual man living in Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

As many of you I'm sure can relate, I've known that I never want to have kids from about 10-12 years old. I decided at 18 that I already wanted to get a vasectomy for many good reasons, but I knew I should probably wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 22 I decided to try and get the vasectomy. Talked to my doctor who was understanding but skeptical. He sent a referral to the vasectomy clinic in my city. The vasectomy clinic called me and explained that they would refuse to do it on anyone younger than 25. They think its a risk to them that I might regret it so much later in life that I would sue them for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I decided to try again now that it has been a couple years and I am coming up on 25. Doctor sent the referral to the clinic. They called me. They were more understanding this time seeing as I was going to be almost 25 by the time they are booking vasectomies for. But still questioned me a bit. They said that they would let me apply online and make my case and the doctor himself would read it and decide. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, r/childfree, any tips? Anyone have similar experiences? Is there anything I should definitely NOT say?

I'll make a comment on this post with what I'm thinking of saying to the doctor and maybe I could get some advice on that too. 

Thanks for Reading.

I hate how open to children my college is.,My college is really open to parents bringing their crotch fruit onto campus and even into classes. I hate it. Because they dont watch their kids and let them run wild. I was grabbing food in between classes because I was hungry. And theres two crotch fruit running all the way from one end of the cafeteria to the other. And they're throwing a ball ahead of them. At one point one of them even almost went in between a strangers legs to get the ball. And these parents have their backs to the kids. Not even looking at them. Someone could have tripped on that ball and gotten hurt. What the fuck. Im so pissed.,childfree
Nature's Bitch,"I went out with a guy I met on Tinder last weekend. We met at a bar and were chatting over a beer. I mentioned during the conversation that I don't want to get married or have kids. He then asked me why I didn't want kids to which I firmly replied that I didn't like kids and just didn't want them in my life. He started talking about how it is human nature to reproduce and everything is pushing us towards having children to propagate the species. I took a deep breath and braced myself because I assumed he was about to try to convince me that it is my duty to have children. I said ""So what"". He paused for a sec and said ""I don't want to be nature's bitch"" and smirked. We had a good laugh after that.",childfree
Broke my five years long relationship,"I was in a relationship for five years.


We were really compatible: we loved and liked each other a lot in several ways: sexually, emotionally, philosophically, etc.


But she has a kid that was two and half years old when we met. 


I wasn’t sure about having kids but I hadn’t been with them previously.


I discovered through the experience (her kid and the kids in her family) that I don’t like them a lot and I don’t want to have one of my own.


Don’t get me wrong: I never treat them bad or anything but I just don’t like them a lot.
It was difficult for both of us to have that source of conflict but we tried to still be happy together. 


At the end, our relationship got really wore down by conflicts derived from that so she ended up leaving me. 


I tried to get her back but she didn’t want to and now it seems like we are definitely not getting together again.


I know that what she did is perfectly reasonable and probably is the most logical thing to do but it still hurts too much having lost her; specially because we seemed to be so perfectly made for each other except for that part. 


Have you been in the same situation?


Please, try to be understanding.

Bingo Response -- My Personal Best!,"A week ago I was approached by a man who comes into our office often.

He's always been a bit shady and asks me questions that border on being too personal.  I may be a little sensitive to what others find to be ""normal conversation"" since privacy is important to those of us who are in this line of work.

Anyway, he comes up to my desk after wandering a bit.  He locks his gaze onto me, but I try not to make eye contact.  He starts up anyway.

Man:  So.  You're engaged.  I know *that.*

Me:  Yup.

Man:  You got any kids?

Me:  *trying to be funny but deter him*:  NO!  Thank goodness.

Man:  So you don't want any?

Me:  Nope.  Sure don't.

Man:  Aww.  You'll change your mind I'm sure.

Me:  No, I won't.

Now I'm the only one in the front of the offices.  It's quiet and he's leaning over my desk.  I look up at him and he's giving me the creepiest fucking smile.  This weird old man has been making me uncomfortable since my first week at this job.  After the next comment, I'd had enough.  

Man:  Yeah.  You'll have kids and they'll be so pretty.

Me:  Do you make a habit out of not listening to women when they tell you ""no?""

He paused, stopped smiling.  I stared at him, honestly waiting for an answer.  I was so pissed and if he'd said another fucking thing, I would have walked down to my boss' office.

The nosy prick nervously chuckled and walked away from my desk.  He paced through the halls a bit then left.

Crying babies are worse than vacuum cleaners in terms of worst sound,"I was watching GLOW today, (amazing show everyone should give it a try if they like good writing and killer stunts) and in this particular episode a baby was crying for an extended time and very loudly. The entire time this crying was happening I clenched my jaw so hard that it hurt. A baby crying is honestly one of the worst noises in the entire world. Rather than having the ""normal womanly biological urge"" to nurture that the sound of a crying baby is supposed to evoke, all I felt was rage.

New to the Sub.,"So I'm fairly young (22) but ever since I was a child, I knew I never wanted children. I can honestly say that reading through this sub has given me so much peace. 

I'm still adamant about being CF. But what I find disheartening is how when I say this, people find it appropriate to discredit my emotions and feelings. Ranges from family to strangers and no matter what I end up feeling like they're right and I'm wrong. Maybe I will change? Maybe I won't find someone who also wouldn't want kids? I'll be disappointing my mother because I'm her only daughter? 

It's really hurtful to hear it from my mom. She already has 2 grandkids from my eldest brother and I have another brother who wants kids too but she still tells me ""grandkids from a daughter is much different""

Sometimes I'm made to feel like I don't have a REAL reason to be CF. I tell people I just hate kids, I don't want to go through the pregnancy, I don't want to add to overpopulation, I want my career to take off and I'd rather focus my efforts on that, I don't want to bring a child into this dysfunctional world. Mostly, I see how much my mother struggled and honestly I was a super tough kid and I feel regret about it all the time. 

I do love kids but they are not for me. My career field will have me working with children and that's all I want. I have a niece and nephew and they are the best! I have life-long friends who already have me as the ""aunt"" for their own kids and I'd be more than happy with that. I'm okay with how I see my life going.

Selfish.,"I just got back from vacation with a friend of mine. She has two kids, and so many of our conversations about them deal with how hard it is for her, or how much her and her husband's extended families will or won't take the kids, especially when she has a day off and wants time alone. She has become the whiniest of moms and the most annoying of friends.

For the record, my husband and I tried to have kids. Three years, several miscarriages and lots of money later, we made the decision to be childfree.  We haven't looked back. We love our life of freedom, enjoying what we have and having just us and our pets to worry about.  We could have gotten a surrogate or adopted, but it's not what we wanted. 

So whiny mom (WM) cornered me on the trip. She does not approve of the ""Childfree Movement."" She said it's a hate movement, and she ""gets the idea"" that we're just calling all parents Breeders. And that I'm not really Childfree because at one point 10 years ago, I tried to have kids. That now I'm just throwing the fact that I have time and money into the face of those with children.

I'm furious. I bought the trip for WM, in part because she seemed like she needed the break. She's been a friend since we were 15, and I thought I was doing something nice for someone who sounded like she really needed some time off and I should have been able to enjoy it myself. 

I'm pretty much ready to dump WM. On this trip, I also got an earful about how her parents in law won't take the kids much, even if her MIL is having a good day (MIL has terrible health problems). Why is it ok to foist the kids on the In-Laws because WM wants some me time?  And why am I sefish for enjoying life without kids when she's just envious of my lifestyle (she admitted this after several drinks)?

Is a friendship like this ever salvageable, or should I just walk away? 

And why is it ok for a mom to be selfish, but when I'm trying to be generous, she says I'm being selfish?",childfree

Idiot Parent,"Tapas night! It's 7:30pm on a Thursday, my partner and I are seated for a nice romantic adult setting. Everything is great to start with.... but then strolls in a mother and her daughter of 7-8yrs old and is seated RIGHT NEXT TO US. The place is small and cozy in its quirky romantic theme but all of that is tossed out the window in this situation. My chair is right against their table. We looked around in hopes to spot another table to move to, but all were reserved. So we are pissed off as we now have to keep our conversations PG. The kid is being a kid with her delighted out bursts of triumphant scoring and the parent once in a while hushes her to tone it down as they are playing a pen and paper game of sorts. Meanwhile we are trying to just enjoy our dinning experience regardless but then that gets soiled due from the child accidentally getting sauce on her shirt - proceeds to take her shirt off - nude from top down aside from her wide open coat.  WTF?! Yeah, that's the look me and my partner give each other.  We simply pretend they do not exist, just denying the idiocy as you do. They eventually finished up and left. Now, as I am writing this, I am wondering should I have pulled the mother aside to say ""please dress your child, cover her up, I do not care to see this?""

Guys who won't get vasectomies,"So I made a post a few days ago about my friend's bf saying he'd never get a vasectomy because ""It's controlling“ (she never asked him to btw. Just asked what they would do in terms of a more permanent option of birth control once they didn't they didn't want more kids. She's decided she'll probably get sterilized). 

I mentioned this to another friend of mine and she told me a lot of guys she's talked to about it say they would never do it, even if they didn't want kids or didn't want any more. She said one time she was hanging out with her male roommate/friend, friend/ex and a few of their friends and they got into the discussion of vasectomies (not sure how) and every one of the guys said they wouldn't do it. She asked them why and one of them said ""Because nobody is touching my balls! Besides the chick is supposed to"". The other guys agreed.

 I asked her if they understood it was a short procedure with little recovery time and side effects aren't common and are usually minor. Meanwhile a tubal requires being put under, a stay in the hospital, longer recovery time and is more risky. The risk of reacting to anesthesia and bleeding out for instance. While deaths due to lubal ligation are still rare they do happen (more common in third world countries). No deaths have ever been linked to vasectomies. Not to mention the cost difference (if you have to pay). Not saying vasectomies are zero risk and there aren't a percentage of guys that have had a bad side effect such as chronic pain in their scrotum or hematoma (which usually resolves itself but in rare cases requires medical attention. No scalpel vasectomies carry less risk) but they are less risky overall. Also if they understood their balls wouldn't be chopped off and it could be done without a scalpel or needle. She said ""Oh yeah they get how vasectomies are done and I told them there are more risks for a woman. They still said they wouldn't do it"" One of them gave the reasoning of ""It's different for women. Their stuff is inside. Balls are on the outside so it's worse"".

Umm wouldn't cutting someone open and operating on internal organs be worse? 🤔

Do a lot of guys actually think this way or are her guy friends just idiots? One of my exes and a friend of mine had vasectomies and they didn't have any of these ideas about it.",childfree

Sterilization Advice and Stories,"Hello, all.

My husband and I have been married for over 3 years. We have had long discussions about having children and have decided that it is not for us. I would like to be sterilized, but due to my age (22) I feel as though finding a doctor that would listen to me would be difficult. 

Being childfree is my main reason for seeking sterilization, but not the only. I have been on Depo for almost 3 years and am feeling the effects of it. In the past 6 months alone I have gained 30lbs, even  while dieting. I have started developing large stretch marks. My joints have also started popping and cracking multiple times a day. My acne has come back. I fear that if I bring all of this up to my doctor that he will just tell me to switch birth controls. I prefer long term, so this isn't an option for me as my family has a history of rejecting IUDs and implants and I cannot take daily pills. 

I just want to live a childfree, pain-free life free of medication being the solution.

What are some of your sterilization stories? How did you convince your doctor that this was the right choice? I go back in April for my annual and would like to have all of my ducks in a row, so to speak, so that I can try confronting him about what I want and why I want it.",childfree

So not only with my family accepting my status. My mum is happy with none of my sister's or I having kids. She is looking forward to when she can retire and move back to New Zealand and live out the rest of life in bliss.

Dad is pretty passive. I'm sure he'd of loved a boy in the family (4 daughters and we drove him insaneeeeeee) but he respects our decision. 

I just starting doing dog walking for this couple with a rhodesian puppy. (puppy tax later) and when I met him, I made a quick quip saying 'i'd love puppies over babies anyday' and they agreed with me. They're an older couple, maybe like late 30's and it sounds like kids are not in the plans since he wants to remodel and she's got an all hours kind of job.

They then recommended me to her mum who runs a kennel, so I do dog walking there and look after the dogs and help her with a few things. After a few days of knowing her, i was sitting eating my lunch and she started going on about her pos ex husband. I made a joke saying 'i don't think I'll get married, too much hassle. Same with kids' and she agreed with me. 

'never get married, there's no point and kids are overrated.' I know she loves her children but the lady is an absolute free spirit. 

She closes the kennels over winter (Jan, Feb) and just travels. The stories she tells me of the places she visits just sound awesome. 

I just feel so lucky that in all aspects of my life, I'm surrounded by people who respect and agree with my views, no bingos. I love it.

Open letter to the terrible parents at that fancy restaurant last week.,"(This might be a long one, I apologize, it happened a few days ago but I'm still seeing red so I really need to let this out.)

Dear terrible parents at the table behind me last Sunday, 

I hate you.

Due to my shitty and busy life, I have one, maybe two days a year to be with my parents. I love my parents, they're cool with my CF choice and lifestyle, supportive and they're my role models. Last Sunday was one of those days. Since we hadn't seen each other in a while and their anniversary was coming up, I started furiously saving money so I could take them to that one nice restaurant in town where each person can easily cough up over 100€ a meal. 

I thought we were in for a fun, peaceful evening in each other's company, so you could almost see my heart abandon my body and flee in horror the moment I see you two strutting in like you own the place with 4 little wild demons in tow who were already scratching, punching and screaming at each other and generally being obnoxious even before they walked in. My parents gave each other the ""uh-oh"" look as they see my face of utter disappointment and defeat.

My expectations were partially subverted as they were sat down on the table behind me and instantly went quiet. ""ok""- I thought - ""maybe I misjudged you and they're actually surprisingly well behaved"". Boy was I wrong, but at this point I should know better I suppose.

This quiet period lasted for about 20 minutes, during which me and my parents were just barely able to catch up and get the small talk out of the way before the more serious topics come to the surface. Meanwhile, the horror begins unfolding behind me. The one that I assume is your youngest begins to get restless and fussy, because of course he does, he could be no older than 4 and quite frankly has no business being on a that fancy-ass, expensive as all hell restaurant with live jazz music after 11 pm. Seeing as you two were dressed to the occasion and were able to be there at all, I refuse to accept that you couldn't afford a babysitter, and even then there are far more child-friendly, low cost places where you could take your children to a meal without destroying everyone else's nights. Cue to the second child beginning to get fussy.

At this point I'm praying to Jesus, Buddha, Zeus, heck... even Cthulhu and the old ones - anyone who would listen - that they don't start screaming and ruin our evening. Well, joke's on me because of course they did. As I begin to question the existence of any deity, the 4 little demons start screaming in unison almost as if they had been plotting this in advance... and what do you do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You see, terrible parents sitting at the table behind me, a real parent would attempt to calm the child(ren) down and/or take them outside so they don't ruin it for everyone else, but I imagine what you were viewing on your respective phones was so damn important and urgent because never once did you lift your noses from them to see what was happening around you. Had you done so, maybe you would have seen the deathglares everyone else in the room was giving you and maybe then you would have done something out of sheer embarrassment but alas, you refused to do anything but stare at your phones in awe as your children leave their sits and begin throwing stuff and getting under tables.

5 minutes pass. The screaming and running is still going strong. The soft jazz music can't drown it out and not even the staff's intervention was enough to make these shitty parents budge from their seats and take care of their children. All the conversations that were going on in the room have all but stopped because no one can truly hope to communicate amidst this screaming orchestra from hell.

20 minutes in. The screaming has escalated to name-calling and cussing. Cutlery and pieces of bread are being flung everywhere, because that's totally safe for everyone in the room. The manager comes out but whatever he told you didn't last for more than 5 minutes because the little demons have resumed their hellish rampage. I can't tell if the manager is a spineless doormat or if he just can't be bothered anymore, even though people are starting to leave in droves.

40 minutes pass. After all that time of attempting and failing miserably at having a serious conversation with my parents, we finish our meals and decide to forego dessert and drinks in favor of leaving that place. I am seething and have that ""the next person who looks at me sideways is getting strangled"" look on my face. I have a terrible migraine and my ears are ringing, I am well and truly furious. ""Well, that was interesting."" says my dad. Normally I would find it funny and say that that's why I don't have any with a smile on my face, but my mood was so negative that I'm pretty sure I would go on a 2 hour long screaming rant about those terrible parents and children that I had to contain myself and remain silent.

You have wasted one of the precious two nights a year (if I'm lucky) that I have with my beloved parents and I hope you're proud. Your non-existent parenting skills give parents everywhere a bad rep and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Normally I try to be understanding of parents in public settings, especially when they have multiple children but I have reached my breaking point, so I really only have one thing to say: Fuck you and I hope we never meet again in this life.

Sincerely, the guy who passive-aggressively stepped on your toes on his way out. I may have apologized at the time to appear innocent but I want you to know it was completely intentional. If nothing else, at least you looked up from your phone for once.

&amp;#x200B;

Mombie giving away cat on Facebook page,"Black cat appreciation page on Facebook. Mom of toddler is ""rehoming"" a 10 year old cat.

Mums back from maternity leave are the worst,"So, in the organisation I work in, there are some pretty big benefits if you're a mum. It's a very family friendly organisation that tries to balance work and family life.

Basically, once you go on maternity leave, you are paid fully for six months, then a bit less for the rest of the six months. You're also given a bonus like everyone else, even if you haven't been there throughout the whole year or done even a little bit of work. 

You can work from home, take days off (as long as you make the hours up another day), and everyone is super understanding if your kids are sick and you take days, sometimes weeks, off.

And of course, there's always special treatment around Christmas. We are given the opportunity to say which days we'd like off around Christmas and New Year's and we are supposed to compromise with other colleagues. Naturally, the mummies request all the days off and essentially tell the others to go fuck themselves. This is even if its half an afternoon and you are travelling across the country to see your family, but they live 20 minutes away and live with their family. 

If mums fall behind in productivity, it's basically overlooked. There are massive double standards between mums and people who dont have kids. I'm massively productive compared to the mums in the team, but I get shit for not doing enough and they get away with doing the bare minimum. Excuses are always made on their behalf by management.

Despite this, mums constantly complain in my organisation. All they can talk about is their kids. You know the saying ""All roads lead to Rome""? The mums there have their own motto, which is ""All conversations lead to my children"". They constantly whine about how difficult being a mum and working simultaneously is, and they complain that they're tired all the god damn time. They incessantly gatekeep colleagues who are tired, as they're not allowed to be tired because they don't have kids. They birch and moan that they have tons of work to do and it's unfair that they're getting more work. They also complain that they can't work from home properly, because their kids don't sleep. They say ""I have to work around my kids' sleep patterns"". Hun, that's not what working from home is. Working from home is working at home, not working around your kids' schedule and maybe seeing if you can squeeze in your work. They also complain constantly and disrupt everyone else, even if they're not engaging or have headphones on to indicate that they're trying to get on with it.

It's infuriating.

Conflicting Ideals: Having Kids for Selfish Reasons,"(Prepare for a huge text wall. Sorry)


So. My mom gave birth to me and my sister. For the longest time, my mom had told me to plan out my life - part of that plan was to not be married and have kids until I've gotten my career in order.

And I was into that.

Years later, my life has not gone as planned. A lot of personal strifes and downfalls screwed up my perfect little ideals for the 'American Dream', and have distracted me from having relationships. Hell, even when my life was alright, having a boyfriend wasn't part of my mindset.

But when I was in middle school, seeing everyone with a boyfriend/girlfriend and kissing during lunchtime made me jealous that nobody liked me. Then after major event in my life that made me move away from my mother, I went to finish middle school at another city, with my father. At that school, I developed the biggest crush of my life, which only grew even bigger in the next two years (since we literally moved to the same high-school).

Years later, I spontaneously moved back with my mom, and I tried to talk to my crush over email. But as the months went by, he talked to me less and less until he just stopped responding to me. I bore no ill will, cause I figured he had a life outside the computer (which might tell you how much I still like this guy).

I was heartbroken, but moved on with my life. I still have no boyfriend, but my desire for one has exponentially increased over the years.

Now, to the point. I've often joked to my mom about having children, and she replies with - ""Haha! That's funny, you know you won't have children!"" And various things along those lines. I laugh back, agreeing at first, but when we get done talking, I wonder about my family's future. When my parents die, what will happen to my generation of the family?

My sister's body is smaller than the average person due to medical condition, and I fear that having a child will kill her, if not make her body worse and more fragile than she already is. Me on the other hand don't want children, cause I get stressed with everything else in life, and don't want the added stress of taking care of another person that isn't my hypothetical partner.

But... then my family will die off, won't it? If my sister adopts, she's obviously not raising her biological child, hence, not necessarily continuing our bloodline. I don't want my family's name to die off, and the only way that wouldn't happen is to bare a child, which I don't want at this time in my life.

Hell, I might not ever want children - and that's my choice.

And before some of y'all ask, my father actually did remarry, and has a son of his own, along with having his stepdaughter. So, I suppose the bloodline can continue if my brother decides to have a child, unless events happen in his life that will prevent him from having children traditionally (such as being gay).

So my question is: does anybody else feel this way? Thinking about having children just to continue the bloodline? And how do y'all get out of that slumping and selfish mindset?",childfree
"""I had several mental breakdowns because you do not want to give me grandchildren!""","This is one of my mom's lines to force me to get a man and have babiiiiieeeez.

Your health is more important...because you reproduced?,"Not sure what to tag this...first time posting. Just wanted to get some other like-minded people's thoughts. Please be gentle.

So, I'm getting my hair done (which takes forever cause I have a shit-ton of hair), and one of the other stylists not working at the time comes over and hangs around whilst my stylist is working her magic.

I have been suffering from colitis caused by an infection and was ranting to my stylist about some bitchy nurse at the doctor's office who literally hadn't done her job to get me meds blah blah blah (seemingly unrelated but it is relevant, promise). Other stylist, who came over mid-conversation, immediately and physically recoils with a disgusted look on her face, ""Stay away! I don't want to get sick.""

My response was to smile ('cause I don't handle awkward situations well) and explain that I can't give it to her like a cold. The infection is literally only in my intestine. The only way to spread it is for you to ingest ""poop germs."" 

To clarify, a carrier (who, btw, is literally millions of ppl that never get sick and don't know they have it as part of their gut flora) to poop and not wash their hands, touching things that others would touch and then their mouths. Or, one would have to use the restroom that a carrier did, again, NOT WASH THEIR HANDS, and then eat or touch their mouth. (I explain all of this to her.)

I further explained the only reason I had it is that I went on a strong course of antibiotics that basically decimated my gut bacteria, and then I was susceptible to this infection. Any adult (or kid for that matter) with a regular functioning immune system is not at risk. Or, you know, WASH YOUR HANDS after going to the bathroom and before eating, and you pretty much eliminate the risk of contracting anything.

After me explaining this to her, with her eyes glazed over for a good portion of it, her response was, ""I don't care what you say. I've got kids. I *can't* get sick."" 

-And btw, yes, I'm aware you have kids, other stylist, because you have bitched about their dad and how no one wants to date you because of them since your first day here (I've been a client longer than she has worked at the salon.) If that didn't give it away, your crop top revealing your stretch-mark-warped belly button that you sport every time I am here sure would have.-

After that I just checked out, feeling extremely embarrassed as she recoiled from me, and treated me like a friggin' leper.

Maybe I'm being too sensitive, but honestly it felt extremely rude, enhanced by some serious mombie (am I using the term right?) entitlement. Like, okay, so you have reproduced, and that suddenly means that you are more important than anybody else in here? It also felt really insulting, like she thought I either didn't know what I was talking about or...maybe I'm lying just to I can infect her precious spawn! * sarcasm *

IDK just looking for some of your opinions and also maybe suggestions on how to respond in the future. I'm very awkward/introverted, and I would really appreciate some help on how to stand up for myself in situations like this. (If that's even warranted?)

Sorry for the long post!

TL;DR: Lady freaks out about my illness that she can't catch, stating she ""just can't get sick"" because she has kids and treats me like a walking biohazard. Looking to see if I'm too sensitive, she was a jerk, and/or suggestions of how to respond/deal with situations like this in the future.

Do I need a reason??,"People often ask, ""Why don't you want kids?"" but I find that they usually already have assumptions about why I don't and are trying to evaluate/debate whether or not those reasons are acceptable to my situation. What often comes out in these types of conversations is the benefits of not having children, which I am fine with discussing. 

But, do I need to give them a reason??? No! I have never felt that I needed a REASON for not wanting children. However, I have searched my soul for the answer to this question, and for nobody's benefit but MY OWN and it feels so good to know my true feelings. Are you ready for it? The reason that I don't want children: I have no desire to be a parent. Simple as that.",childfree
I’m honestly not sure if I want kids,"A little background,

My parents have about 5 kids that they fostered and adopted, 2 of those were babies when I was in high school. I think it’s awesome that they took these kids in because now I have new siblings who would otherwise go on to live terrible lives, if they even got the care they needed. Each of them has been born with disabilities on top of or because of drugs in their system at birth. My two oldest lil bros weren’t supposed to live past a couple of months and are now 5 and 6 years old. Although it’s great that my parents adopted I had a lot of responsibility when it came to caring for them growing up. It interfered with just about everything in my life until I moved out of state for school. I’m talking like, I had to call into work because of the whole “family first” thing. It was a part of my downfall into depression.

Fast forward to now and I’ve been married for a few years and I’m looking for work while my wife starts her career in teaching elementary school. And Jesus Christ on a bike, her stories work just as well as birth control I swear. I won’t go into detail but let’s just say small children can be unexpectedly violent. 

I’ll also say that I’m deeply involved in our local church. This is relevant because typically evangelical or church culture is pro-children. This puts a lot of stress on finding a place to fit in when the young adults classes are filled with parents, who don’t mean to talk about their kids all the time they just do because it’s a huge part of their lives. What’s funny is that I actually work in our middle school/high school student ministry. I always tell people, “teenagers are easy to work with because I can tell them to shut up without them crying.” Of course I don’t often tell students to shut up but the point is that small kids drive me crazy because they either don’t listen, or they don’t understand. When they’re so small parents are still super protective and get defensive when you have to correct their kid, even if that’s a part of your job! Whereas most parents of teens will (jokingly) say, “just whip them into shape if they get outta hand.” Teenagers are actually pleasant to work with because at least they can think on a deeper level and have somewhat of a real conversation. 

It gets tiring for me because I’m hearing stories about these children all the time and it really makes me not want kids at all. Where prior to getting married I was open to the idea after several years of marriage and having been in a career enough to be stable. Then you have total strangers in church asking when we’re gonna have kids and I just wanna scream that my purpose in life and as a believer isn’t to have kids. Shoot I don’t even know if my wife and I can have kids so how much more rude would that be if we couldn’t, ya know?",childfree
I’m so much happier since I discovered this lifestyle,"My title says it all really. Ever since I was a little girl I never liked kids. I did not find them cute, entertaining I didn’t even have a desire to play with dolls. I never wanted a sibling of any kind. 
But I honestly didn’t know not having children is even an option that a woman has. I always thought that I will have kids when i’m going to be 35 or something similar because by then your life is over anyway (13 year old me was very dumb,lol). I can’t even remember when it hit me that this lifestyle is a possibility but let me tell you this subreddit helped me greatly every time I started thinking my choice might not be so valid after all. 
I’m 20 now and I can’t imagine a life in which I would choose to have children. This sub is very important and a great support system for many. Stay golden r/childfree !",childfree
Roommates new GF has toddlers...,"My bf and I have been lucky enough to have had a roommate who is almost never present for the past 6 months, until recently..  Honestly even when he was around he’s always really cool and chill. But now he just started dating a girl who has two toddlers, one under 2 and the other 5. Yesterday afternoon he tells us “oh yeah X (the new gf) says she’s staying over with the kids. 

First off, it would have been really nice if he had just asked first. My bf and I are both very much happy and adamant on not wanting kids and not wanting to be around kids unless it’s family but I don’t think the roommate knows this. So now I have to rush home and move all of my shit that’s at kid level into our room (action figures, comic books, oddities etc). I manage to get there before the kids are there luckily so I don’t have to see them, then I go to the mall to blow off some steam and not be home.

When I come back the roommate and the new GF are at home on the living room couch
-the youngest crotch goblin slobbering all over my Halloween blanket and pillow. 
-there’s a chocolate milk stain on the wall. 
-I go in the kitchen and she’s putting her food on me and my bf’s side of the fridge
-one of my GOT plates has a big crack in the center
-my Halloween decor has been rearranged to different locations of the house 

Mind you this is the first time I meet her so I do my best to be polite because I’m not an asshole. She seems pleasant but the way she interacted with me just makes it seem like she’s already too comfortable for someone who just started dating. The roommate brought up my bf and it’s Friendsgiving plans and she decided to invite herself and now she’s inviting all her friends with kids... oh joy.... more children... and people I don’t know coming into my house..... I’m pretty unhappy at this point and I excuse myself to the room. Bf applauded me for being cordial because he knew deep inside I had a burning rage, immediately after he says that one of the creatures starts screaming bloody murder and I just lost it and started bawling. 

I spent most of last night crying and got about 2 hours of sleep before I had to wake up for work. My anxiety is through the roof because the one place I loved and felt calm and stress free is now about to be a big source of stress. I can just tell she’s going to be around with the kids more often and I feel like there’s nothing we can do about it. 

I wake up this morning and the roommate has already left for work and left the gf with her kids ALONE at the apartment. Which frankly is not okay in my book either, if you have guests you need to stay with them. I don’t know/ trust her and if her and her children are going to go through my things when I’m not home.  Like I said they JUST started dating, I feel like none of us really know her. I have no PTO so I couldn’t even stay home and watch my shit but my bf didn’t have to go in until 2 luckily so at least he could keep an eye on them while they are there. 

I’m so scared this is going to have a negative effect on my relationship and my home life. I’m currently at work and I’ve already cried at my desk twice so yeah my day is going great. I also just want to note before I end this rant, if it were just her we would probably be fine with it as long as she respected our space. 

TL;DR I don’t want to tell him his girlfriend can’t come over, but I really cannot deal with kids being at the house all the time because I cannot relax around them. I have no idea how to approach this.",childfree
Pre-emptive advice please,"I have a friend who has a toddler. We are very good friends and usually she's great but I need some advice about how to handle an upcoming conversation.

 I'm going to be getting fillers soon because I'm unhappy with a certain feature of mine on my face. I'll be spending a few hundred on it, I've been saving up for this whilst working three jobs over summer and now I'm finally going to do it. I want to tell her because I'm excited but I have a very strong feeling she will say something along the lines of ""I wish I could afford fillers but I can't because I have a kid"". I don't know if she says things like this out of self pity or trying to make me feel bad?? She knows I'm child free but will say things like this that annoy me because she chose to have a child, I didn't and I shouldn't feel bad about that (check my post history for a rant about same friend)!

What can I say in reply to a comment like that to shut it down but also NOT be catty or snippy? I want to have something ready to say because if she says that and I'm not prepared I'll probably tell her she should try working 60 hours a week and then she'd be able to afford stuff like that (which wouldn't go down well...)

Restraining order against a Narcassist who tried to trap with 'vasectomy' - [Celebrating 2 years],"I thought I would share my experience of a relationship that I had almost 3 years ago now and hope that it will be of some help to those who have fear in leaving a toxic relationship. If you aren't happy, then you need to decide to live for yourself. It will hurt, like coming off an addictive substance but it will be worth it. It's only hurting you.

I am 25. CF decision my whole life, got ADHD/Aspergers, history of longstanding depression and anxiety. Binge eating disorder / then anorexic/bulimic. Even had I wanted kids, I would not be a good parent. I am so much happier now, and spend my days managing my mental health.

Essentially my BF of 6 years, 3 at the time was very much against me going to university. (Age 19). We were as you call it 'childhood sweethearts' and I very much believed we would always be together. I adored this guy at the time, we did everything together. And I mean everything. He took up so much of my time, that when I said I was going clothes shopping with my cousin, (A girl 18) he asked if he could come, then sulked when I said, ""not really"". And because I was so eager to please him, I said I wouldn't go. I was entirely friendless, and I thought people just didn't like me. That's what he told me. I only needed him, not in so many words but enough that I believed that.

I started filling out my UCAS form to apply for university (UK.) and when he discovered me in the library. (I had been so ecstatic to apply to uni with my one friend in my class, we'd been talking about it all day!) he broke down, cried and said if I left, he would kill himself.

So I applied for an HND (worth 2 years) at the local college. I didn't go. I wanted more freedom after, and I resented him for that.

Since I was 18, I had an implant (nexplanon in my arm) and after asking my GP for sterilisation which was flatly refused, she mentioned my partner getting sterilised. I brought it up and he agreed absolutely. He was silent about it for some time- and then one day he announced he'd got it done. I was stunned. When? How? Perplexed, I asked, ""are you bruised?"" ""did it hurt?"" He said a lot, and he's just lying down.

I was elated, so happy I'd not have to worry! But I was keeping my nexplanon for my periods because I was a lucky bugger who didn't get any periods or side effects. (till recently lol).

He was thrown out by his mother for his lies, constant stealing of money and 'abuse'. We always just thought his mum was a nutter, which she probably is but obviously now I know [better.](https://better.As) As ex became more withdrawn and dark, he became different. Homeless, my Grandmother housed him. Of course, he then started extracting money from her too.

I didn't believe my ex had a vasectomy. I had caught him lying randomly about certain things- really random and unnecessary small things.

So, I bit the bullet and I asked him to prove it. My mum told me anyone can pull up a medical record. He would have letters, calls, anything. At the time I asked to see, he told me he was a 'proud man"" (ROFL) and that he was ashamed to let me see him like that. I laughed it off and when I tried to tug at his trousers, he pushed me hard and very angrily. He became more physically abusive and later locked me in a room on holiday for behaving like a slut. (FYI, I've only slept with him at that time.) It was, ""for my own safety"".

My anxiety and mental health was in tatters thinking he could lie to me, encourage me to get my implant taken out. If he hadn't, he was trying to deliberately harm me. That was the most damaging.

I applied for the university that summer. I was going to move out. I'd had enough. The stress he was putting on my family, between me and my mother was hellish. I went to university and we were on and off. I didn't believe him and he became more and more vile. Especially as I'd gained more confidence and was now going out (age 22/23) at university and he still lived with my grandmother in my hometown 60 miles away. He said we should get married, and how cool would it be if I had a ring I could show off to my classmates. (What am I, lol?)

I cut him off and then we got back together, did it again and again. Then one day, he gave me an ultimatum, either I drop the vasectomy bull\*\*\*\* or he disappears. He got his workmates to go and harass my father at work. My Dad is very quiet man. Ex was so destructive and spiteful and aggressive. But he made me feel small, and that I couldn't live without him.

So, I messaged this work mate and explained that my now ex-BF, was a liar and deliberately trying to get me pregnant saying he had a vasectomy. Apparently, if you call a narcissist out on their controlling lies, they cut you off.

So he disappeared and I didn't hear from him again. I was in bits, hateful and angry at him but I also didn't know how to be without him. 3 months after, I was full of rage and energy and decided to get myself together, and dress up, go out with some girls from my class. Pictures on instagram...! For the first time in my life, I changed my FB status to single. I was starting to feel ok. A message the next day on how he couldn't live without me. Of course.

I received 48 messages. In one day. Almost 200 over the course of a few weeks. And then he stood outside my flat at my university and sat outside throwing a tennis ball at my window. These came from a new email address every 20 minutes. Really creepy stalkery email addresses.

Then he took pictures of my road, my classes. ""I'm here princess."" In the email. ""I saw you, princess. Why are you keeping me out in the cold?""

He waited nights on a bench outside. I was terrified. Even after security removed him twice it continued.

He had a blog he wrote on about raping me and getting me pregnant and ""breeding"" me.

Now I am not proud of this, but male attention made me feel good when he had made me feel so small and ugly (he fueled an eating disorder for years, I was 45kg 5""4). So guys who spoke to me online helped with the fact I was so lonely. And it had been so hard to make friends with girls, or in fact anyone. So when guys took interest in me, I usually chatted with them. I never sent pictures. (As he had lied to me about ones before, and I had to log in and delete pictures he promised me he deleted. He smashed my university bedroom when he found out what I'd done.)

I started hanging out with another guy on my course. Of course, I was just looking for attention and company at the time. (Thankfully, I fell in love with this man and he restored my faith in men after a long, long time together. He is a saint for putting up with me! It took me a long time to stop flinching when he moved too quickly. My ex used to rush at me as if to hit me then completely lose it when I flinched.) But this dude who I was friends with turned out to be my ex in disguise getting info about me. My ex then messaged me as himself to say what a slut I was, and then 10 minutes later changed his mind and wanted me back. (By this time, he is standing outside my door. Following me.)

The police told him to stay away and he was on bail for that time.

But he emailed to tell me exactly what he thought of me, now I was dirtied with someone else. We hadn't been together in months. I'd had no contact but I was still in his mind his property. That swapped and changed between his fantasies and wanting to breed me and hating me because I was a dirty sl\*\*.)

The police spent a week looking for him and found him in his hometown and the police from that district dealt with it. I waited to hear back, and the police started filing for a restraining order. In that time, I start rebuilding my life. I get a call from my local police station and I have to go for an interview as there had been a complaint made.... For ABH. Apparently, I'd attacked my ex. (He was a 80-90 kg guy and I was 45/46kg at time. I am a healthy 50 kg now :) ) I was so angry and shocked. The supposed attack was during new years when he had argued with me and his flatmates had heard the shouting. I knocked a snow globe off his shelf and it smashed. During this time, ""I got him on the floor"", overpowered him and injured him. I was almost half his weight! The police thankfully were super understanding and it was over 7 months ago so it was clearly a revenge accusation. I am so grateful that all the districts actually communicate with each other.

It was dropped.

I got my restraining order. After 6 years, I was finally free. However, it took me a long time to trust again. I wasn't able to love my partner till after a year and felt numb. I probably did jump into a relationship too soon- but I was so vulnerable and my partner was older, kinder and mature.

Since this time, I have had multiple messages from other Chinese (or Asian) girls (I am part Chinese) asking ""Is this article true?"" As his stalking and breaking bail was in the local paper. He has gone abroad to groom young Asian, Filipino girls under the age of 18. He has a real fetish, its quite vulgar considering how he treats them. But with the assumption theyre compliant and obedient.... And Catholic, so there's no option for abortion.

I am relatively new to reddit but have been looming around posts for a while- so I thought I'd share. I hope its not too disturbing.

Today I was chatting on Skype with my dad and told him I am happy I do not have kids because I enjoy sleep way too much and if my kids were to wake me up screaming, like [my cat](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9831581e65e634553f7c1f77c5c8a22/ba4419bda70d64bb-d6/s640x960/749cee45035f363e434713302038c171ce37d4b4.jpg) does, I would sell them on ebay. To which my dad looked at me condescendingly and said ""you will have them and you will find that you will be grateful for them"".

I had to end the conversation because I was on my break at work and time was up, but BRUH.

I always felt my family are relaxed about me having kids or not, but my dad has been dropping hints more and more. And today I felt like an additional weight has been added to the pressure. I felt so upset that my dad feels I should still strive to give him grandkids. What kind of criminally narcissistic asshat has kids this late in life?

My mum used to tell me ""always strive to make yourself liked by boys, otherwise you will become a witch living alone with cats in the forest!"" That  became a self-fulfilling prophecy because I was never partial to living my life in such a way to please others. And, while I do feel kind of lonely sometimes, I look forward to being an eccentric old Goth - with the money to back up that aesthetic because I did not have kids.

How would you respond positively?,"I was just reading up on positive psychology, as it's important for me to stimulate students to look forward and reflect on what they've done so far (I'm a teacher of English as a second language). 

In private life, however, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to respond **actively** and **constructively** to what my friends and family perceive as 'good news' when they're pregnant. Usually, the best I can do is passively and half-heartedly acknowledge their newfound goal in life and mourn the loss of yet another soul. As you can see, I could use a dose of positive psychology :)

It's not that I feel that I'm obligated to gleam and inquire intensively, but I don't want to constantly be the cynical party-pooper. ^(There'll be enough of that going on soon enough hehe)

Anyone have simple positive responses or questions that avoid the typical baby banter, yet still activate the other party?",childfree
A book recommendation: Inferno by Dan Brown,"Some of you may have heard of the Da Vinci Code. This is a book from the exact same series. 
The main character is a bachelor named Robert Langdon who's a professor at Harvard. He then goes on an adventure through Italy to stop a population control virus from spreading (which is spoiler alert: a sterility virus).
It has a lot of religious and scientific themes and is a race against the clock, and all the main characters are childfree.  Not to mention every organization or artwork mentioned is real.

"Just when you think you're safe, BINGO","I have numerous posts about why I'm not having kids, the list is long and fruitful. My mother, for the most part, has been supportive and has slowly come around to my way of thinking. I want to say that she's a wonderful human, kind, caring and a great grandparent to my Niece. She replied to my CF coming out with 'yeah, I figured' and slowly she's accepted my more extreme views around antinatalism and population control. 

So, back story. I had a friend, we'd been friends since we were 4 years old. We stopped being friends at 26/27 years old, we are both of the same age 2 weeks apart. This friend had five kids, her being my best friend I helped. I help raise them, care for them. I babysat every week, I would just go around to help. I've done all the shit that parents do, everything from nappies to discipline. I took her kids on holiday, I baby say for her 3 eldest and her stepson (ages 4,5,6 and 11 at the time) for three days while she went on her honeymoon (so, nobody better say I don't know what it's like to be a parent, I will beat them) I supported her financially, thousands over the years, so I more than most know all the downsides! One day I realised that this wasn't a friendship any more, I was a bank, a babysitter and being taken for granted. I approached correcting our friendship several times but one day I realised that it wasn't going to happen, I'd dug this hole and now it was done. I walked away and the friendship ended 4 weeks later with an awful emotional blackmail message from her which I ignored. 

Leaving those children killed me, I was devastated for YEARS. 

The other day, my mother brought this up. She asked about one of my friend's kids who I was particularly attached to, I'm not ashamed to say I've sobbed over the loss of this child in my life, I adored her. My friend's family and mine would joke about me stealing her, she's one of the only kids I've ever really wanted to spend time with. As would be expected I got emotional. 

Then came the bingo, ""before all the childfree stuff, I could see you being a great mother. You loved X(kid) so much."" It wasn't the words but the inflection that knocked the air out of me.  Like I was missing out on something like I should want it because I know I can love a kid, as if eventually I'd move past being hurt and want kids. I quickly rebuked with ""Yeah but there are so many reasons why I just don't want it."" She smiled and agreed with what I'd said before about being free etc. Her love and understanding back in place.

But you know, it was a passive thing but it really made me feel like crap for a second, like my choice wasn't valid or was tainted because I'd been hurt. People don't understand that you just want your choice accepted. No take backsies, just yeah, this is you.",childfree
“Kids are something that comes with marriage whether you want it or not”,"This stems from a much larger argument/conversation with my dad and his family. I could easily write a novel about it tbh, but I’m gonna keep it to the sparknotes version. 

Long story short, my long term BF and I want to eventually get married (not now, not tomorrow, not even next year). My dad has never liked my BF because he doesn’t have a college degree (dropped out due to family circumstances/money) and thinks his family is “low class” because many of them are in the trades instead of academia or white collar professions. He always had this vision that I would go off to college just to meet some rich doctor, lawyer, or banker to breed with. My BF works in a tech field and is making about the same, if not more than many of my friends that went to college (and even got masters degrees). But money and career aside, he loves me. He respects me. He pushes me to be my best and always strives to be the best partner. Anyone (excluding my dad) whose ever met him would tell you what a selfless, caring individual he is. 

So long story short, when my BF asked my parents for their blessing to propose, my dad said hell to the fuck no. He’s literally found any reason he could to tell me I shouldn’t do it. So this is where it starts to get real juicy and my CFness comes into play.

My dad essentially told me I’m destined to follow the “Lifescript”. He told me I’m too young to be getting married (I’m 25 lol). First he asked me if I was pregnant and if that’s why I want to get married so fast so I don’t have a baby out of wedlock (I told him fuck no and to get the hell out of here with that shit). He told me I need to enjoy being single in my 20s and getting all the partying out of my system now because I quote “marriage is what comes with having kids, whether you like it or not ”. He continues on to say “did you know BF doesn’t want kids? That’s not a real man. A real man wants to pass on his legacy. He’s just a lazy POS incapable of applying himself. “ To which I responded “yeah it’s a mutual decision between us and I’ve known I never wanted kids since I was a teenager”. He went on with the whole “you’re too young spiel” and once again reiterated the title.  At this point I was so pissed I just became extra petty and told him “well thankfully that won’t be an issue because I know where the Planned Parenthood is”.  

Needless to say he’s pissed as shit at me and we’re not talking. Oh well. Don’t step on my toes and insult my life choices. I march to the beat of my own drum and don’t need anyone else’s approval on my life.

EDIT: I’m getting a lot of flak over the fact my BF spoke to my parents about proposing (even some of you going as far as to suggest I shouldn’t even marry him over it). I want to clarify my boyfriend has NEVER treated me like his property nor at any point in our 5+ years of dating has he ever made me feel that way. He spoke to my parents purely out of respect. It necessarily wasn’t to get their permission, but rather just to say “hey I wanna propose, I hope you can support our decision to elope someday”.",childfree

"Let me frame it for you, Larry.","I was having dinner with a handful of co-workers last year; none of whom I work with anymore.  One of them is a close friend to this day and knows my stance on having kids.  God bless him, he’d heard me frame it for people who were relentless a handful of times and not only did he sit through the awkwardness but did so with a straight face.  

So, here goes:  

Setting:  interior of a nice restaurant.  I’m seated beside my good friend.  Larry, 61, sit across from me and Peter, 57, sits beside him, across from my good friend.  

Larry:  (to me) So when are you having kids of your own? 

Me:  I’m not.  

Larry: aw why not?

Me: I don’t want them. 

Larry:  you’ll change.  I changed.   

Good friend:  Larry, don’t. 

Larry:  why not?  My wife was like this, too.  She changed.  She loves our kids.  

Me: I don’t want them.  I don’t like them.  

Larry:  if you had them, you’d love them.  

Good friend:  stop Larry.  Please.  Trust me.  

Larry:  why?  It’s conversations like this that people need to have. 

Me:  Larry, I don’t want kids.  

Peter:  does anyone want jalapeño poppers?  

Good friend:  they’re going to burn your asshole, but order them anyway.   

Larry:  (to me) have you ever held a baby? 

Me:  okay, Larry, are you ready for me to frame this in a way that I’m certain you can grasp

Larry:  I’m all ears.  

Good friend:   Oh the fuck you are Larry.   Trust me.  

Me:  nah, it’s cool.   You ready Larry? 

Larry nods.  Peter orders jalapeño poppers. 

Me:  DO YOU LIKE DICK LARRY? 

Larry: excuse me? 

Me:  I asked you if you like dick.  Cock.  You know, peckers, Larry.  Do 👏🏻 you 👏🏻 like 👏🏻 them? 

Larry:  no! 

Me:   Have you ever held a cock Larry?  Like, someone else’s cock? 

Larry:  this is inappropriate. 

Me:  so is insisting I will change.  It’s saying that you’re gonna like dick one day.  One day you’ll change, Larry.  One day you’ll like dick.  

We were pretty quiet until those jalapeño poppers arrived and Larry never asked me about having kids again.

Edit:   I wanted to just follow up and say that yeah, Peter was, and still is, the real MVP.

Edit 2:   You know, I want to expand on this because I’ve definitely been met with “it’s not the same, having children is a biological urge and it’s natural.”   And, if you use this, you will to.  So here’s where I go with that BS:

“Okay, so wait.  Gender and sexual fluidity are not?   These things are complex and complicated for some people as is the desire to have kids. Don’t dismiss that complexity.  

What I’m trying to impress upon you is that child-bearing and parenthood can feel as alien, unnatural and repugnant to me as the thought of having a dick in your mouth can feel to you.  The same you feel you will never naturally want that is the same way I don’t want have a child.  You may have found my analogy offensive and you should take that into consideration the next time you discuss family planning with someone.”",childfree

Stories From Set: I’m a Photographer and a Woman. And I Don’t Want Kids,,childfree
"I saw this article in Finland which made me really really furious, I'll translate some of it here.","""""The nickname ""Mother Not Ready for Infertility"", writing to the audience section of Helsingin Sanomat, describes what it feels like to lose the chance of becoming a grandparent.

A woman telling about her difficult situation. The woman's daughter is married but the couple doesn't want children.

The woman writes - I don't want to deny their right to make choices. However, I also want to make the feelings of those of us in the shadow visible when we lose our future grandparency(idk if that is a word but it's all I could come up with for the translation)

She says that when someone she knows tells her that they have a grandchild, she feels envy, sadness, and a feeling of helplessness.

""The thought of never having grandchildren is sad""

She is now seeking the help of society.

- There is a need for groups where people can share their feelings and learn to accept this lack of life.""

This to me was a load of bullsh*t. I sent the news station this message regarding this article:

""This is just awful, you advertise this view of ""have children atleast so your parents can be happy"" and it is messed up. Why are older generations so focused on ""my child will make me a grandparent"". It is just as awful as expecting your child to be straight and then hating on them when they aren't. The norm belief should be ""my child will make their decision and I will be happy about it"" bc then if they would have kids you would be happy about becoming a grandparent and if not then be happy about that, but blaming your child for something to the point where you say ""I wish there was a therapy group for this"" is truly f'd up. Making your child feel awful so they'll think ""my choice made my parents so sad they have to go to therapy"". I'm really disappointed that you publish this side of the story in a way that instead of emphasizing that it's an awfully selfish way to think, you make it appear as if ""all parents want to become grandparents and society should provide aid for parents being left out of their dream"".""

They likely published this bc for some reason it is seen as a bad thing that people here are having less kids than before(was it like 1,8 per couple or something). In the media there's always these ""reasons to have kids"" and ""we should give more aid to parents and push people to want and have kids"". I for one will never want kids and am happy about it. Sorry if the translation sucked I tried to pick up the points in the article that to me felt stupid as fk. Hope you all have a good ""childfree/accidentally had a child oopsie"" day.",childfree
My most irresponsible friend and her boyfriend of 1 MONTH have decided they are going to try for a baby.,"My response when she told me was ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?. My friend (B) met her current boyfriend exactly 4 weeks ago on a night out and 2 weeks later they signed a lease on a £1400 a month flat (she’s £2000 into her overdraft and they are already scraping for bills). If I had to describe B in one word: Chaotic. She goes through boyfriends quicker than tampons, falls in love too quickly, raves about them being the one, then gets bored or they get too clingy and the relationship turns toxic - constant arguing, controlling behaviours etc. 

She is adamant her current boyfriend is her soulmate and she hasn’t been able to picture having kids with any of her other boyfriends. I reminded her of her career ambitions, travelling, financially stability, and all the other big and little things that will change. She shot down every point. ‘’ I’ll do this new job until I get pregnant, get enough experience to get onto the doctorate course, then study through my maternity leave’’ WHAT?, ‘’I don’t really care about travelling, I mean it’s nice to go away and we’ll do one big trip before the baby, but it’s not something I really care about’’, and she justified the financial instability one with her boyfriend receiving £1500 monthly and  £30k 2 yearly payouts from an injury sustained while in the army that doesn’t affect him anymore. HE’S BEEN GETTING THESE PAYOUTS FOR YEARS YET THEY’RE SCRAPING FOR BILLS THIS MONTH? According to her they have it all figured out.

Oh and finally! ‘’But our babies would look sooo cute!’’.  I honestly feel sorry for this kid, B is impulsive, terrible with money, a poor judge of character, is on medication for social anxiety and depression, is only 23 years old (boyfriend is 32), and has only known her boyfriend for a month. HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE A GOOD IDEA? (Her family support her decision).

Sometimes I think it's a mental illness.,"...to want to reproduce if you have literally nothing going for you.

This is another excerpt from my adventures through support groups for my various illnesses that I browse. 

This woman is 4 months pregnant and was asking for advice on whether she should do a C section or vaginal birth.

No bingo items after first year of marriage -- What does this mean?,"I came across this sub after Googling stuff about getting married later in life, and I realized that my wife and I fit the definition of childfree, so I got intrigued.  I even found the bingo card in the FAQ.  But the weird thing is, as much as I would get irritated to hear some of those comments, like ""you'll change your mind"", ""why don't you want kids"", ""children are a blessing"", ""you're being selfish"", and can easily imagine people saying those things to us... so far, we haven't encountered any of it.  From the posts here, it appears that other childfree people get it all the time.  So it got me wondering why it hasn't happened to us yet, and what it means.

We've been married a little over a year.  Is that not long enough?  Do the comments about having children usually come after a few years?

We both got married later in life than average, plus there's a bigger age difference between us than usual -- she was 33, and I was 47.  Plus neither of us had ever been in any other long-term relationships prior to each other.  She's at the age where people would normally tell her she's running out of time.  But perhaps they figure I'm too old to start a family by this point?  Or maybe they're just so happy that each of us finally found love after so many years, that they don't care if we have kids or not?

Although we got married in our 30's/40's, people say we both look a lot younger than we really are.  (When I first met my wife, she was 29, but I thought she was around 17!)  People also say we're the ""cutest couple ever"", especially when we post selfies of us together on social media.  Maybe they just see us as a cute young innocent couple in love, and can't really picture us being grown up enough to be parents?

Or maybe, if I really want to be paranoid, for some reason that nobody has ever told us about, maybe we don't strike people as a couple that will last more than a few years, so they don't want to encourage us to have children that would complicate our situation after we split up?

EDIT:  I'll even throw in that we're an interracial couple, in case that means anything.  (Nobody has ever made an issue of that before, though... at least not that I've heard.)

I know I shouldn't complain about the lack of bingo remarks in our childfree life, and I do enjoy the fact that we haven't encountered any so far.  But I just wonder if there's a reason for it that could mean something even worse that people might be thinking about us behind our backs.  Or if there's a simple explanation based on our unique situation.  So I'd be interested in any insights anyone might have, based on the information I've mentioned above.",childfree
I just don't... WANT any.,"I just felt like sharing, because I've been thinking about this a lot lately. This turned out a little long and rambly, and it may make no sense, but I had very little sleep these past couple of days so I'm truly sorry about that.

Upon reading so many posts about why many of you are here, I have had to realize that... at the end of the day, I don't really have a REASON to be childfree.

All things considered, I'm a healthy, fertile (as far as I know), 25-year-old woman in a loving and harmonious, long-term heterosexual relationship (with a healthy, fertile, and very handsome 25-year-old man) with enough disposable income, enough room in my home, and technically nothing barring me from having kids. I could have one tomorrow, and nobody would bat an eyelash- people would just be like ""yeah, that sounds about right"".

I've only been reading this subreddit for the better part of a month, and so many of you have SO MANY and such well-defined reasons, it has made me think about mine... and I came up empty. Like, yes, each and every one of those reasons you guys give are perfectly valid, and more than enough on their own (ranging from hereditary conditions to the general stickiness and grossness of children), but none of them are the very first thing I think of when asked. The first thing is that I just... don't WANT to have kids. Case closed. And when asked, I can't say much else besides ""I don't want that in my future"", which, to so many people, doesn't seem to be enough.

(Which is so strange to me, because personally, I can't imagine how not having a kid in the first place would be worse than having a kid that's unwanted.)

Ultimately? Sure, pregnancy and childbirth are nothing short of a horrifying hellscape and reminiscent of the 1979 cult classic film ""Alien"", but my first and fundamental reason is just... that I don't feel a desire to have a child in my life, and I'm content with the way things are. I felt the desire to have my kitties, I feel the desire to have a dog, I felt the desire to be with my partner, even changed my mind on marriage because of him... I don't feel the desire to have a kid in my life, biological or adopted. I'd be content living in the same apartment, with the same man, with the same cats, for another 50, 60, 100 years. And I'm a firm believer that with this one thing being the single irreversible decision in life (you can sell a house, divorce a spouse, quit a job, switch majors or carreers, even have someone else adopt a pet if you absolutely must, but you can't ever undo birthing a child)... the only reason to do it is if you're 100% certain and enthusiastic at the prospect.

Violent hate is not the only ""no"". Complete apathy twinged with antipathy is not a ""yes""- it's not even an ""I could go either way"". *Anything less than an enthusiastic, happy, excited ""YES, I WANT this for me!"" is a definite and non-negotiable ""no"".* 

Motherhood.... just holds no appeal to me. It never did. So I won't do it. And simply not wanting to be a mom is reason enough not to become one.

What are you guys' thoughts, are any of you like me? Are there any of you whose main reason to be is CF isn't well-defined and detailed, but just a very simple ""I don't want it, so I won't""?",childfree
Being CF≠Not having a life or being able to work the leftover shifts,"So I work at a restaurant, and I understand that it's normal to have some change in schedule sometimes. It seems like unless you are a child or have one, your schedule just gets 0 consistency. Can't have the same days off, can't work the same shift, ect. I've had weeks where I'd work 3-11…5-1…12-8 ect and I rarely get the same shifts/days off as the last schedule. 
Am I overreacting? I don't think I am but it just feels so annoying. It's hard to plan anything, maintain a decent sleep schedule or anything. And it's not even like I'm a manager who signed up to work more hours.",childfree
Why don't governments do this?,"This applies to countries where there is a welfare system.

This applies to girls only because there is no reversible long term implant for men.

The basic premise = contraceptive implant with a cash handout. Removal of the implant is on a sliding scale of cost with it free at the 5 year mark.

Either copper IUD to avoid hormones or hormone based contraceptive. Yes all have side effects, so does having a baby.

1. Age 15 - a 5 year contraceptive implant plus £1,000 cash.
(It costs the government more than £1000 to deal with a teen parent and baby, the cost of the birth and one year of social welfare is more than 20 times that)

Cost of removal £1,000 until age 20.

2. Age 20 £1000 cash for 5 year implant. £1000 to remove in years 1-2, then 800, 500,200.

3. Age 25 £5,000 cash, with removal 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, 1,000 and free at the end of year 5.

By this age, the taxes someone would be paying instead of being a stay home parent would be covering the fee.

4. Age 30 £10,000, with a similar sliding scale. Again at 35, 40 and 45.

5. At 45 the option to tie tubes for free.
* the reason this is not offered earlier is that the religious would not stand for it but even there most agree about 45 the risks of pregnancy complications for mother and child are very high.

Also free condoms everywhere. Doctors surgery, shopping malls etc. The shops would still sell fancy types, ribbed, flavoured or whatever. Men should be encouraged to wear them.

This counters eugenics arguments. You are not forcing anyone, and if £1000 or at age 30 £10000 is too much to turn down then you can't afford to look after a kid.

Hopefully greed would be enough to deter the feckless and the only people having children would be those who have made an active decision and can afford to do so.

Why wouldn't this work?

'Oh, but everyone has a right to have children !1!!'
'Noone's stopping them'
'but you're bribing them'
'yes, if they want the money more than a child that's their decision'
'but then poor people can't have children'
'by breaking the cycle of poverty where underaged people with no qualifications or work experience have their careers permanently crippled by caring for children, they have a better chance of enjoying parenthood.'",childfree
My mom is finally getting it!,"My mom started bingo-ing me the day I left home. ""When are you going to settle down?"" and ""I want grandbabies""... you all know the spiel. I got a dog and started referring to her as my mom's ""grand-dogger"" and my mom actually sent her a puppy kit with treats and toys and still sends her Christmas presents every year. 

The bingos kept rolling in all the while. They even got worse after my sister had a baby girl. I ignored them for a while longer. Eventually, I came out and confessed that I am a lesbian. My mom's response? ""Well, you could always adopt."" FML. 

This year, though, they finally stopped. Last month, I attended my sister's wedding. With kids galore, one of our family friends said something about me having a baby one day and my mom actually said ""Oh, allthemarmadillas isn't going to have children."" She didn't even say it resentfully; it was just all casual and matter-of-fact. 

Freaking finally!! She's finally accepted the fact that I'm not going to have children and am not going to change my mind! I almost thought it was too good to be true but yesterday confirmed the good news- my mom texted me asking whether I heard my sister is pregnant again and didn't even mention me having a kid. Instead she said she missed my dog. 

I am so relieved and happy. My dad had no problem accepting that I'm CF, my sister doesn't try to convince me (and didn't even ask me to babysit after I said hell no the first time), and now my mom is finally on the same page. I feel so lucky! I hope more of y'all get to find some acceptance with your families.

"I'm sorry my lifestyle (and others you know) makes you feel guilty, but fucking stop taking out on us CF people when we bring it up in conversation!","So, I have this friend, he married young, had kids in his late 20s and early 30s. Followed the life script and all. 

He snapped at me a while ago when I posted a meme that both CF and parents would share. I finally told him a few days after that I didn't appreciate how he handled his problems. He revealed to me that he is jealous of CF and empty nest adults. And that makes him incredibly jealous, and because of that he feels guilty, and because of that guilt, its wrecking him with anxiety.

And look, I am sorry that you feel that way, I wish you didn't and that you were happy with life. I really do. I don't have anything against people who want kids. I wish everyone finds happiness in life.

Cut to today, I comment how when I pay my student loans off 5 years early, I am going to take that money, and buy myself a brand new mid engine corvette with that money since I have no other obligations. And what does he do? Jumps down my throat AGAIN because I am flaunting my CF status. Because apparently buying a 60-80k car in a couple years down the line is CF. When many families spend that much on an SUV. 

I am so tired of his shit, if his wife wasn't so nice, and part of a bigger friend group, I would drop him like a sack of shit. As it is, I am already an asshole to him when he says stupid shit in group chat. 

Ugh. I am tired of being attacked because I chose not to have kids. Handle your own shit dude.",childfree
Got bingoed in a video game by another woman,"Yes, you read that right. I got bingoed while playing a video game a few nights ago and damn is it stupid.

So I'm an F26 Lesbian (this will be important later), and I was in a discord call -onna friend of a friend's server- with the guys while we played Rust. Another member of the server (let's call her... Connie) joined the call and all was going well for a while. She mentioned not being on for a bit due to a new baby. Ok fine, we're cool. He boyfriend? Husband?  Was looking after the baby while she played with us, occasionally picking the baby up to play with him. I was getting annoyed by the wails of the baby , but I tried to ignore them so as to be polite, all while trying not to quote Danny (from Game Grumps) by telling ""God, get that kid a bottle!""

Eventually she started talking about her baby and we all got into the conversation of kids and such. I mentioned that I didn't want kids, as I get put on edge and their cries makes me want to leave the room/area because I get that uncomfortable (I wasn't dropping hints, just explaining myself). Another gay friend mentioned that I must lack a motherly instinct (fair enough, and I agree) and then Connie leaps in and starts going on about how I'll change my mind. 

Apparently she was Child Free until one day she got curious enough to try or something and boom she had a child. I think she has 2 of her own and has fostered many others (including this new baby I think) and how she changed her mind. Apparently I'm young enough to still change my mind and my opinion will change when I have my own.

I kind of started to get pissed, and I started listing off why I didn't want kids. From health issues innmy family -including reproductive issues with women on my mother's side- to me not feeling ready, responsible or able to support na child, or even being a lesbian and not interested in the idea if kids or men (oh but adoption and sperm donors! Shut up lady). I even mentioned the abuse I suffered at the yard of my mother, saying I didn't want to risk losing my cool onna child AND not wanting to have ANY child around my mother.  

Luckily the boys shut her down by changing the conversation back to happenings in game but still, it pisses me off that she bingoed me even after I had valid reasons and tell, didn't need to explain myself to her but did anyway. Like who ignores the fact that you were abused and mentally you may not be able to handle raiding a child, and says ""you can still have kids, your opinion is will change"". Lady I get bingoed by my doctor, I get bingoed by my mother's side of the family... I'm unsure if I can look after a dog if I get my life settled, let alone a child! Me recognizing that I'm not ready or even responsible for another human's life should be a sign of maturity a sign that I at least have my priorities straight and that I want to be responsible. 

And if I'm ever responsible enough, I'm getting a dog instead. You do you lady, and I'll do what I feel comfortable with.",childfree
"After years of telling me he doesn't want kids, my BF wants kids.","My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 10 years, living together for about 3 years. We first started dating when we were in high school.

For years, he was adamantly opposed to the very idea of having kids, but I was in love with the idea of having a child when I was ""ready"". I had been raised with the idea that having kids was ""just what women do"", and it took a very long time to shake off that mentality. My BF and I talked about kids off and on over the years, but he remained fully opposed. And, as I got older and wiser, I lost my desire for kids. We were perfectly happy going child-free for the rest of our lives...

Until now. I don't know what caused him to change his mind, but a few months ago, he started bringing up the idea of us having kids someday. It's mostly just him joking about our future children doing dumb things, or how our future kids would brighten up our lives, or some shit like that. I don't know whether or not to take it seriously. There's a list of reasons that we *can't* have children, and the idea of having kids also makes me really uncomfortable now.

Got approved for tubal ligation!!!,"I’ve been wanting to pursue sterilization for a few years now, but I assumed it would take a few appointments to build a paper trail documenting my intent or find a doctor who would do it at all. Not expecting much, I went in armed with my binder and ended up talking with the gynecologist for 45 minutes about why I prefer sterilization over long term non-permanent methods and the importance of doing it sooner rather than later— I’m experiencing a lot of pain with Paraguard and have no interest in hormonal methods, but really I’m just sick of delaying what I ultimately want to do with my body. 

The doctor was definitely skeptical and kept stressing how unusual it was for a childless 24-year-old to be coming to her asking for a tubal ligation, but I think she was begrudgingly impressed with the binder and had to acknowledge that I had thought of it from every angle. I was surprised when the conversation turned to how the surgery and recovery would work, and even more surprised when she said to talk to the front desk about scheduling.

I’ve never advocated for myself like that to a doctor, but it was so empowering— even if she hadn’t said yes, it feels really good to go in knowing what you want and having the facts to back it up. I don’t think I would’ve been able to do it if I hadn’t found this sub, so thank you to everyone who’s shared their tips and experiences! I’m going to be sterile!!!",childfree

Parents Gotta Learn to Live and Let Live,"Inspired by a post I saw about parents hating on CF people in other threads:

It strikes me how the most core goal of being childfree is to simply be *left alone.* For people to hear that we are childfree and leave it at that; no trying make us say ""we might change our minds in the future hohoho."" Like I also might win the lottery next week, or trip and bash my head on a rock, causing me to loose all knowledge of even basic human function. There's no reason to say something like that other than to try to make the CF person doubt themselves with gaslighting or something. It's rude, and it's malicious.

For people to quit trying to make us say their baby, specifically, is the exception/adorable/etc. *Every. Person.* Tries to make you say Their Baby is the exception. That's not possible. That's not how exceptions work. And saying ""No, they aren't an exception"" shouldn't be an insult. They're a baby, I care about it no more or less than I would any other baby. I didn't say I would chuck it in the trash, my only observation is that it's a baby.. It does the same 3-4 things every other baby does and it will for quite some time. None of those 3-4 things are of any interest to me. The fact that I don't find your baby any more interesting than any other baby should be neither surprising nor important.

For people to quit letting their kids run amok in our yards and houses, and near our animals. I know we make comments about wishing kids were banned from certain places, but if the parents made them sit in the restaurant chair, watch where they're going in the store, be quiet at the movie? Most of us *wouldn't care.*

We don't want children, and that's somehow a slight. We don't want to be around children, and that's somehow a slight. Somehow, some way, not wanting to have or be around children is a slight even if it isn't malicious. I don't want a pet pigeon, that's fine. Don't want a kid? I'm the devil. I'm hateful and toxic or I'm just deluding myself because I haven't met the right person yet. But if any of that was true, why bother engaging at all? Why spend the energy on a hateful, toxic person? Why waste the air if you can so assuredly wait and say ""I told you so"" down the line?

People need to learn to let people enjoy things or the lack thereof. Want kids? Cool. Don't want kids? Cool. Hate chocolate? Want pineapple on your pizza? Already celebrating Halloween in July? Awesome. As long you haven't stabbed anybody (for example, obviously other illegal things that shouldn't be done) or made a public nuisance of yourself it shouldn't matter.",childfree

Update: I dumped my anti-choice partner of 3 years,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/dg7k4m/my_male_partner_is_childfree_but_not_prochoice/)

Amazing people of this sub your support was overwhelming and much appreciated

So we sat down to talk and I told him that I couldn’t be with someone whose values were fundamentally against mine

He got all defensive and said I was picking a fight because of a very hypotetical situation and that I was choosing imaginary women and a imaginary abortion over him (??)

He also said that other women would never throw away a great partner like him for my sake (???)

We then had a pretty bad fight I said I wanted to give our relationship a break so he really thinks if he sees me as a person of equal value, come back when you realize you’re being a asshole

I asked him to get out for a few days for that reason (he moved with me to the apartment I rent so only my name is on the lease)

He asked me if I was “getting ideas from bullshit feminism forums” and if now I'm a lesbian

I’m baffled!!

I said you know what? Don't come back at all

He sort of freakd out and said that the feminist agenda wants to break up healthy straight couples like ourselves!! Lol!!! What’s his standard for healthy, not beating the sh\*t out of your wife?

So for those who asked me how in 3 years I didn’t know he was like that… he wasn’t. He was a neutral guy then started being indoctrinated by conservatives online

My heart aches for the nice smart guy he once was…

I really really like ex-SO, I certainly thought he was -the one- if there is such a thing for the last couple of years, but there’s no point in trampling over my self-worth to try to fix a man (especialy one that's been contaminated this way)

So that’s it… I feel relieved but sad and it sucks that at the ripe age of 32 I’ll need to get myself a roommate!

Held a baby over the weekend and everyone was surprised I didn’t immediately change my mind on being CF after holding baby for 30 seconds lol,"Been lurking on this page and thought maybe you guys would find this entertaining... 
I (28F) was at a family event over the weekend and held one of the party attendees twin babies (it was a family friend)...I decide to hold one of the babies (please note: I said “ahh I guess I’ll hold one of the gremlins as I’m taking the baby lol) 

It def was cute baby but just passed out and cuddly. So pretty easy to manage. 

My own mother than says - “ ohh you change your mind about kids now!?”  And proceeds to start taking pictures of me. 

And the mother says “omg you don’t want kids? Even after holding him?” 

I reassured them - “yes even after holding your cute baby I don’t want children” 😂

I just found this so funny and odd. Like this chick thought her babies were so powerful to light up my uterus into baby mode. FOH

He brought his 2 year old to dinner,"I made a comment about this on a thread earlier and it got so popular I figured some people would want to hear the whole story.

So I've been on Bumble for about a year. I like it more than Tinder because  1) the woman controls the conversation 2) they have actual security checks so it's harder to catfish and most of all 3) you can put on there that you don't want kids. Which is great because it's so awkward once you start talking to someone and you find out they have kids.

I normally don't like guys who dont have the want kids/dont want kids option filled in but this guy checked every box for me. And yes I know I'm shallow AF but he was tall, athletic, liked animals, smoke free, and hot. Model hot. 

Anyway we matched and hit it off right away. He was really funny and nice. In all honesty I didn't even think to ask if he had kids. There were none in his pictures so I just assumed. I know. Bad. 

Anyway he asked me out to dinner and I accepted. He actually asked me to this really nice place that I had been wanting to try but it was way too pricey for a broke college student. 

I get there and I'm totally prepared for this guy to not look like his pictures and or stand me up. But when I see him pull up he actually looks like his pictures! Huzzah! Then he opens the back door and pulls out *dun dun dun* A TODDLER!!! 

At first I'm optimistic. He says ""I'm so sorry, the sitter canceled, this is Sammy. Dont worry he wont be any trouble"" I smiled at him and said ""Oh no problem, I dont mind if your little brother joins us"" (I was so hopeful) 

He just laughed and said ""Oh no! Sammy here is my son! I'm a single father."" 

Well crap. Now I was stuck. If I left I'd be super rude plus staying = free food. So since the kid seemed to be pretty well behaved (famous last words) I decided to stick it out through dinner and make up some story later to leave quickly. There obviously wont be a second date but call me cheap I love free food.

We get in, get seated and the waiter puts down water and menus. Then all hell breaks loose. 

The kid Just. Starts. Screaming. 

I don't know if he was scared or the people were stressing him, or if he saw dead people. But he just starts screaming bloody murder. His dad tried to shush him. Then gave me a smile and said ""This happens sometimes when we go out. No big deal."" All while the kid is still screaming and has now started throwing things. 

At this point I've had it. No free dinner is worth this. I bolt. I didn't even say anything. Just got up and ran. Not even exaggerating. I think I may have knocked over a plant or something. 

Anyway I run out, hop into my car, and burn rubber. I then blocked the dude on everything and ordered a pizza. 

I enjoyed the rest of the evening with my nice quiet dog. I will never have kids. Thank you.",childfree

I Remember More Clearly Than my Mom,"For context I'm 27 F and I'm the youngest of 4. My Mom likes to wax nostalgic about how great it was when we were all little but the thing is I don't remember it the way she does. My Mom was a stay at home house spouse and I mostly just saw my Dad on weekends because of his long commute. Can you imagine being stuck in the suburbs with 4 kids? And only the first 3 were on purpose. My Mom has always been anxious and on edge for as long as I can remember. Most of my memories of her were of her being angry, stressed out, and exhausted which I don't blame her for because holy hell 4 kids.

And now that one of my siblings has had a child my Mom is all ""oh I loved it when you all were little! What a magical time!"" like what?

One of the main reasons I don't want kids but never tell anyone,"So one of the biggest reasons I didn't want to have kids and a main contributing factor to me getting a vasectomy is the fact that I hate life. I don't know if I will actually kill myself but it's definitely an option on the table, is it a good one no. Yet it is still there at the back of my mind. The worst part about it is you can't really tell anyone this for obvious reasons. The fact that I'm a broken person that may very well never be whole is something that just haunts me and makes me feel like shit. I can't imagine bringing anyone into this world with me as the parent. But trying to talk objectively about your mental health with people always seems to devolve into how I'm basically just being a bitch.

Do things get less stressful moving forward?,"I am a senior in high school, currently doing three college level classes. The reasons I do them are varied, one is to fulfill a (high school) graduation requirement, the other is because I heard colleges want to see a physics class on my transcript if I apply for computer science programs or urban planning programs. And the other is an exclusive, global city class that I forecasted for in order to confirm that I want to be an urban planner (I do).

Thing is this, in order to be an urban planner, most jobs require a master's degree, leaving at least seven more years (including this one) left of schooling for me to do. 

None of my life plans involve having kids, but I was just curious, because I have heard so many stories of ""stress-free lifestyles"" and ""disposable income!!!"" on this sub, this was the only place I felt comfortable posting this question. Does life get less stressful (in your experience) once you finish whatever schooling you want to do? I know it depends on what decisions you make such as the job you do, or if you're in a relationship, or things of that nature, but is the stress constant, or is there not as much stress as when you were in school?

"So you can't handle three, so you have more?","First off, I would like to preface this by saying I understand having children is stressful and difficult (some of the reasons I don't have any), and that everyone has bad days. 

So I work in a box retail store, and see many of the same people, and see all kinds of behaviour, including shitty kids and parents. Just saw this family that I hadn't seen in a bit, since they had just had twins that were born a month or two early. 

They already had three kids (a girl that is 4, a girl that is 3, and a boy that is 2) that are always a terror, running around screaming and throwing things, having tantrums when not getting what they wanted, and their parents are no better, ignoring all their kids' shitty behaviour to bicker with each other over everything under the sun.

So they come in tonight with all 5 kids now, the oldest 3 screaming about wanting McDonalds, and the newborns screaming because they're newborns. The parents are fighting about something, and soon the kids are grabbing clothes and hats, not sitting in the cart, hitting each other, everything you can imagine. 

All of a sudden the mom just starts shouting about how she can't handle all of this, and that she just needs to get through the store. The dad tries to calm the mom down, but she just starts yelling at him. Then they just abandon their cart and go to leave.

Then the oldest has a complete meltdown, screaming and crying, running around and hitting her parents. Why? She doesn't want to put on her coat. Smh.

All of this makes me wonder, if she already couldn't handle three, why have more? I understand that you can't predict twins, or it may have been unplanned, but you'd think after 3 kids under the age of five, you,'d be trying real hard to stop from getting pregnant again! 

Makes me so glad I never made that mistake. I knew from a young age that I couldn't handle kids, and it took my boyfriend a long time to come to terms with the fact that he won't have any more (he has a daughter from an ex), not as long as he's with me, that is. 

I just don't understand why you'd have more if you couldn't handle the ones you have.",childfree
My coworker,"I don’t really know if this qualifies as a rant since I’m not really mad about it, just irritated/annoyed. I am a shift lead at a gas station that serves food. I’ve been there for 3 years, but the last two months I moved to third shift, 10pm to 6am.

There are two others on this shift with me, only two work a night. Well the last two months the other two have been taking turns having 3 days off in a row and I only get one day off at a time.

So our work week is Wednesday to Tuesday so I’d be off Thursday and Monday. That’s exhausting when you work nights, I’d be sleeping all day on my days off.

Let’s call my coworkers sh and am. Am was bragging to a guest that she was about to be off for 3 days, and she said “all the midnighters get 3 days off”

I said, “no. You and sh get 3 nights off I don’t even get two together”

She then told me I don’t have kids so I don’t understand.

She always says stupid stuff like that, stupid just because she doesn’t understand how she sounds or looks when she says some of the stuff she says.

She always tells guess how tired she is from working a full time job and being a single mother of a 4 year old. She is not a single mom.

I guess because her and the baby daddy broke up that makes her a single mom. Ignore the live in husband she has been with for the past 2 years.

That’s not a single mom that’s co parenting.

She constantly complains about her kid and what she has to do for her as if she is some kind of saint for having to do so. She throws out jabs about me but having kids and it might or might not be selfish, but also says she doesn’t blame me and might be a bit jealous.

Just gets on my nerves sometimes.

Oh! I finally get two days off in a row and she wanted to trade shifts with me cause the day after one if my days she is having a birthday party and doesn’t want to be tired during it.

I said no. I said I’ve been fighting to get two days off for a while I’m not trading it away.",childfree
My breeder sister is the mombie queen,"My younger sister is 29 years old and his four boys under the age of five. This of course impresses my religious parents much more than my PhD in Microbiology, but that is besides the point. 

We live in different cities and rarely see each other. When we do, I am seriously walking on egg shells doing my very best not to offend her in some way. But no matter how hard I try, it is inevitable. Her boys are a nightmare. They are so loud, rambunctious, and play extremely rough. It is overwhelming to everyone. If I ever tell one of her boys to be careful, to slow down, to stop doing something FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY, she breaks down into tears and tells me I am a selfish child hater and I will never understand how hard it is to be a mom. 

This mothers day was also my dad's 60th bday. For once, we had the entire family together and it was such a lovely, special day for my parents. Until she made it all about her, that is. My dad made an innocent comment about how energetic her boys are and shit hit the fan. My heart breaks for my parents because it truly ruined what would have been such a perfect day (despite the fact that the children were around). 

The worst part is that she acts like she is the most selfless, special human being for popping out some vag goblins, and nobody else can possibly understand. Sigh... just needed to vent.",childfree
Post sterilisation,"So, I got home yesterday following my sterilisation. Had my tubes clipped.

I fought for years to get this done, saw countless patronising doctors who assured me I'd change my mind, the usual drivel. But finally, I got a refferals to a sympathetic and understanding gynecologist. And here I am, laying in bed hurting like hell but over the moon.

My other half's mum has called twice, she's managed to not ask how I am each time but had wanted recipe help. No surprise there, she never missed a moment to ask when we'd be having kids. I almost think my other half thought I'd change my mind, despite extensive discussions on this. He's barely asked how I am, how the surgery went and made a scene at the hospital when they discharged me. I had some complications, and it they found out whilst in there I have what appears to be endometriosis, which does explain a hell of lot. 

But despite that, I am over the moon that after 8 years of trying, I am finally sterile!",childfree

I hate parents who see their babies as some kind of an accessory,"So I was babysitting these kids. One was 3 the other was a baby maybe 7 months but tbh they were super chill. There was also this dog who was like super cuddly.

At 7 pm I have to put the baby to bed (I’m child free but the dad is a lawyer and he’s paying me so 💰 💰 💰) and the instructions were to change the diaper, bottle, and put her to sleep in her pyjamas. 

Diaper? She didn’t even move. Very relaxed. Bottle? It’s like she was in a trance. A milk trance. Pyjamas?????? Absolute hell. 

I took one look at this thing and it resembled a monkey costume with a hat and gloves and it covers the babies ears and it’s super fluffy and has like 6 zippers to fit the baby in. As soon as she saw it she started wailing. Now I have to put this thing on her but tbh she clearly hates it so why are you making the baby wear it???

I text the mom that the baby was fighting me to put it on and crying so maybe I should pick another pyjama but she replies saying “oh she always does that just FORCE HER IN AND MAKE HER WEAR IT it’s cute”

Ummmmmmm I’m sorry but I’m not grabbing your tiny babies hands and arms and shoving them into a costume (that’s what this thing really is) while she clearly doesn’t want it or like it. I wouldn’t want someone to do that to me and if she does that all the time then maybe she doesn’t like it??? Your child is not an accessory like a bag or a pair of shoes. She’s a human and she doesn’t want to wear this monkey costume. 

Abortion when the fetus isn’t sentient and aware?? Evil!!!!!! How dare you!!!! Using force to shove a baby into a restrictive costume that they overheat in and they don’t like???? Cute as fuck!!!

Inappropriate Customer,"So, I do service calls sometimes to help fix customers' computers. Most are very nice and decent people. However, I have this *one* customer who always brings up inappropriate questions to ask me. It's sooo uncomfortable. The last time I was over, they were asking me when I was getting married. *I hate that I even shared I was engaged a few years ago. Rip being excited I guess? It'll happen when it happens damnit!* I said I wasn't sure yet, so they followed that reply up by stating that once I do we'll have kids. It wasn't quite a bingo with the way they worded it (they don't mind me not wanting kids), but it made me feel compelled to say, ""That's not all marriage is, and it won't if it's impossible."" I don't even want to reply to these sort of questions. It's a professional business I run, even if I run it alone, ya know? Not really looking for advice here, but wanted to vent cause I have to go over again this week and I'm dreading it. I don't like being confrontational, but I'm going to have to tell them I'd rather keep questions professional. *Siiigh.*",childfree

So what if my reasons for being child free are selfish?,"I’ve seen a lot of people being bingo’d because “we’re selfish,” or worse people here trying to justify their reasons as unselfish. 

Guys, who cares? My reasons for remaining child free are entirely selfish: I have zero interest in ruining my body for some disgusting brat that’s going to be ungrateful and suck all of the fun and money from my life and relationship with my husband. Screw having to pay for a kids school, put my career on hold, give up sex whenever and wherever I want with my husband. It’s 100% selfish. 

And so what? Seriously, it’s not like we’re in some post-apocalyptic world that’s dependent on us with viable eggs to repopulate. Like, we have plenty of people breeding here. Don’t really need more of them.

I don’t have a point. I just needed to rant :)",childfree
Apparently medical problems aren’t medical problems if I’m not trying to get pregnant,"Short version: Bleeding for 3 months straight isn’t an issue since I’m not trying to get pregnant. 

Long version: Essentially I have a “few months on/ few months off” kind of period. I’ll literally bleed for 2+ months straight then have nothing for a few months before it all starts over again. It’s been like this for 6 years. 

When it first started happening, I was placed on the pill. It regulated everything just fine at first, but after about 10 months, no more period. I kept on the pill for about 6 more months after, but a combination of me being in college 6 hours away, it not actually working, and me not really caring because I wasn’t dying led to me not going back to the doctor for a follow up. 

Fast forward 6 years and a new relationship means I need birth control. The period issue hasn’t changed at all but they prescribed the pill last time so maybe I’ll get some relief. Nexplanon gets implanted at planned parenthood and one month later I start bleeding. I’m thinking “sweet, no babies and no constant bleeding!” I have not stopped bleeding since July. 

Doctors appointment gets made end of August but there’s no opening until today so I sit and I wait and hope it stops. It has not. I explain all of the above to my doctor. His response “are you trying to get pregnant now?” I of course respond no. “Well when the time comes, then we’ll reevaluate the whole situation. See you next year” and I get sent on my way. 

No suggestions of removing the implant, no follow up for further testing, no prescription to at least temporarily stop the bleeding for some relief, not even a  “come back if it persists for another month.” Just a plain old “when you want babies, then we’ll talk”

I don’t even know how to feel right now. I waited a month and a half. I was excited to finally get a real solution after all this time. All I got was a handshake.",childfree
Sterilization was this morning (26/F) and wanted to share my awesome experience!,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile.

Okay! I’ve known I was not going to be a mother since I was six years old, when I had cried and asked my mom how women could not have babies and if they could spay me like we spayed the family cat. 20 years later, I finally got my tubal ligation!

So I had the procedure done through Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest, who worked out of UCSD Medical Center, I got the info through this sub actually! I checked in this morning and immediately all the staff was super friendly and welcoming. I was a little anxious when they couldn’t seem to find my consent forms but I remembered I had brought extra copies just in case. I’ve never had abdominal surgery before, so I was nervous but my excitement far surpassed my nerves. The surgeon was Dr. Kyle Bukowski, who I actually recognized from pamphlets and such that they hand out at PP, I think he’s the lead surgeon for the area? He was extremely friendly and helpful, he gave me the option of having a bi-salp or to have the tubes burned, and after we discussed the pros and cons of each and what he recommended I ultimately decided against a bi-salp: I realize that it is the more popular choice on this subreddit, but cauterization was the better choice for me. 

My procedure was fast and when I woke up my throat and jaw were sore from the tube they put in, but that faded really quickly and I was given ice chips to eat. I remember having a big stupid grin on my face and when my mom came to see me in the recovery room I just said “I love you”, and got super sappy: I’m lucky to have a mom who was so supportive of my decision. The scars are very small, the one in my bellybutton won’t even be visible once the bruising is gone. My stomach is a little bloated and sore, but I’ve been feeling absolutely fine on only high doses of Tylenol/ibuprofen. They aren’t kidding about the shoulder pain from the gas they use though, it’s not too painful but it is a really strange sensation! It’s much worse if I am standing up or sitting upright but even then it has been no big deal. That being said I have an extremely high pain threshold and have always healed quickly so your experience may differ!

My insurance also covered the procedure 100%, which is fantastic!

Overall though I highly recommend getting it done if you’ve been on the fence, I am planning to update this in a few days and then in a week or so with any changes, but I am even more confident in my decision now than I was before! Grateful to this sub for answering my questions and providing such great resources!

Feel free to ask any questions, too! :)",childfree
My Ma hates her own children but apparently wants more grandkids.,"My sister and I were talking about life, and she brought up that my Ma said that she was sure I was going to have at least three kids. My entire life I have told her, and others around me that I do not like children. Nor do I plan on having any. I’m 20, F, and in the closet. I eventually told her to her face, that I don’t plan on having kids. She doesn’t take me seriously, at all. I don’t hate children, I don’t hate kids. I just don’t want them.

I am just getting a bit frustrated. Every time I am having a nice conversation with my half-sister she will walk into the room and inevitably change the topic to my lack of a man, and the fact she wants more grandkids. Even though she has told all of her children on several separate occasions she shouldn’t have had kids. I’d rather go without the “blessing” of a kid than have them and resent them their entire lives. 

Life for me isn’t about having “my line” continue. I have 1 twin. 1 half-sister from my mom, and 1 half-sister and 1 half-brother from my Dad. 3/4ths of them already have their own children. Why are my non existent kids so important to you? You don’t even like your own kids, let alone your actual living grandkids.",childfree

I'm actually so tired of telling people I don't want kids ive had to start saying I CAN'T have kids which is insane that I can't tell people the truth jut because they can't fathom someone not wanting one.

Its easier for me to come out gay then to come out CF,"First off I'd like to say that I have a loving family! My parents, my aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents all support me and love me. 





I'm 22 and I came out as lesbian this year. I did get a side remark from my aunt about me ""going to hell"" bullshit. However, that was shut down by the rest of my family immediately. Even my Grandma who grew up in the 40s supports me. 






However, I'm still nervous to tell my family that I have no interest in having kids. My family is big and I am the oldest, cousin/grandchild. I already have a cousin who is about to have a kid. She is not ready financial or mentally but, my family is extremely happy and excited about it. 





I dont want to push my loving family away. But having a kid is just not what I want in life. And I'm not sure how my family members or even my parents would react for me to Express my CF interest. When I was in the closet I asked my about about sterilization for women who don't have/want kids. She didn't like the idea. I had an older brother who passed away when I was 4ish.

I’ve come from the other side,"I want to start by saying that this sub has helped me come to my own (somewhat) controversial conclusion. Controversial in my life anyway. 
Also for context I’m a 26 year old female. 

I was always that person in high school and afterwards in my early 20’s that said “yep, can’t wait to have kids, I’m gonna be the best soccer mum to all 5 kids that I have” and so on and so on. 

The last couple of years my best friend had kids, both my stepsisters had kids a couple months ago and I do a lot of babysitting for some extra cash for people at work (babies that I actually know). 
 
Through all these events I’ve come to realise that actually, no, I don’t want children of my own. The last few months the feelings have come through the strongest and it feels so good to be confident in my decision. I reckon half the reason I wanted kids is because ‘I was supposed to want them’  

When I started mentioning it to people (just in context of the conversation we were having, didn’t go out and make some huge announcement) they all said those silly things: 
“You’ll change your mind when you have a partner”
“You’re still young, there’s so much time”
“You can’t change your mind that considerably” 
It’s been frustrating but I’m starting to get through to people hopefully that I’m serious. 

Maybe in the future I’ll adopt but if I do I’ll be adopting children from 10-12 years upwards. No babies. Don’t know if that makes me technically childfree but for know, I know I am. 

Has anyone else change their mind as they got older or had something happen and made them not want children after all?

FOMO over being childfree,"My wife and I are strictly CF. We both have a lot of stuff we want to do with our lives, and have two adorable dachshunds that we spoil rotten. I’m usually the one vocally complaining about the screaming baby at the store, and get angry when I get anxious. But...there is one thing. 

I am a HUGE baseball fan, both watching and playing. The ONLY thing I’ve ever wanted a kid for is to have a kid to teach my love of baseball too. Unfortunately, we live half way across the country from our families, so we go months or years without seeing our nephews. I read an article today about the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, IA and it was full of stories of fathers bringing their sons out to the field to play old-school baseball. It just hit me in my one weak spot around kids. 

I know, I know. There is no guarantee my kid would be into baseball, and if they are, and that is a ton of rough times to get to the age when they really start appreciating it. Not to mention that this is right up there with probably the most selfish of reasons to have kids. But, I plan to volunteer with YMCA or Little League at some point to coach kids once I have the means to do so.

RANT Bingoed when quitting my job,"Last Monday I had the pleasure of quitting my weekend job in customer service (struggling PhD candidate here) since I am starting a full time job in research and my supervisor decided to be a smartass.

Toxic relationships and children,"I have a friend who’s really into kids. She desperately wants a baby with her boyfriend. My issue with this is their relationship is constantly on the rocks. They have a breakup at least once a month. They fight and insult each other constantly. They also are very financially unstable. He’s about to get kicked out of his apartment beacause he doesn’t have a car to take him to work and back so he can’t keep a job really ( rural town. No ubers or public transportation) and she still lives with family and is 1000 dollars in debt, partly because of him.  And then they go on and on about wanting a child. I think the most disturbing part is that she’ll tell me that they have sex without any protection and no pull out. She even knows she shouldn’t do that  with her situation but she just doesn’t care. I think it’s selfish to bring a child into the world that you know for sure you aren’t ready for. 

What brought me to bring it up here was that I had a pregnancy scare and I was panicking and crying about it because my boyfriend is in the navy and I live with my parents And I know for a fact that I do not want a child ever.  And her words of comfort were “Maybe it’s gods plan”

32 F - Getting a divorce - my father making underhanded comments about me not giving him grandchildren,"After 13 years with the same person we have decided to go our separate ways, which is good for both of us since the relationship was toxic and abusive on both ends. We both never wanted children, and for me to get pregnant I would most likely have to have surgery since one of my tubes has a blockage, so it was kind of a win-win with him. 

A couple days after the separation is final my father, who had been very supportive of the situation up to this point, says to me "" well I guess I am going to have to go find me a young girl to have more kids with since you aren't gonna give me grandchildren - you being the age you are and single"". Maybe I am being a little sensitive about this, but he knows I have medical issues with having children in the first place, he knows my career has always been a priority, and he knows I do not even LIKE children.....and I have been having a really hard time with this divorce - it is hard to let go of the person you have loved since you were 19 years old. He KNOWS all of this, why would be say something laced with so much guilt trip in it???

Bingo’d by coworker..,"This guy worked at my desk for maybe a few months. Have had maybe 5 conversations with him. He’s a few years older than me, and he married and had a kid right out of high school. 

He mentioned his plan to get a new car next year when he got his tax return -
“Cool thing about having a kid is you get like 4 grand back [from taxes]”
“Eh I think the cons outweigh the pros for me”
“Oh kids are great”
“I could get 4 grand or just not have a kid”
“You’ll eventually have a kid, and you’ll love it”
“Probably not.”
“We’ll see :)”

1) I don’t know you 2) don’t argue with me about what I want 3) if I want 4 grand I’ll just not have a kid! Amazing how many expenses I don’t have! 4) cut the cryptic “we’ll see” bullshit - the only thing you’ll see is me not being a parent.",childfree

UPDATE: “My CF friends had a baby” - dog rescue &amp; Charlie’s pink eye,"****If you’re just here for the status on Molly Dog the German Shepherd, I labeled the sections.****

I want to first acknowledge that my original post was removed. I was told by a mod that the resulting conversation was feeding the trolls, and drawing negative attention. Fair, and I do appreciate it being left unlocked so the ✨discourse✨ can continue.

Next, I want to clear the air. I got messages and persistent comments about this: 

I do not hate baby Charlie, and if that was your takeaway...you didn’t read the post or my additional comments. He’s a baby. They’re not my favorite members of the population, but he cannot help his weirdly sticky baby existence.

***PINK EYE UPDATE:***

Some went digging in my post history and found that I’m a medical doctor. The living are not my speciality, but I am, by law, a mandated reporter of child abuse/neglect. 

I personally don’t believe that abuse or neglect is occurring here. (Stupidity? Absolutely.)

You all helped me come to the realization that ALL of our judgment is clouded here (mine, Morgan, Kate, and Rick) and thus, I’ve asked another MD in our medical group to privately speak with Kate about Charlie’s eye. 

***NOW ON TO MOLLY DOG:***

Morgan and I went over last night to have a heart to heart with Kate and Nick. They’re being awful and I am incredibly frustrated by them. That’s all I’m going to say.

Molly Dog wandered into the room during the part of the conversation where Kate broke down crying about how we will “never know what it’s like to selflessly sacrifice for an infant, or the joy in that, because we’ll never be mothers.”

🙃 k

The fur on her hind end was matted with shit. Nails overgrown into talons. Reeked of piss and “wet dog.” Totally silent. As I said, she WANDERED into the room. She used to LEAP to meet us at the door, bark in excitement, lick all over us (lowkey, ew, but whatever).

I’ll keep it short, but Morgan told Kate that Molly’s pure and unadulterated filth probably contributed to Charlie’s pink eye. (She’s probably not wrong.) I really that is the only reason they allowed us to take her. 

She went to the groomer’s first thing this morning. We will be putting her in doggy daycare for most of her waking hours, until we can find a suitable adopter. Our lifestyle would be a disservice to her, so unfortunately our home is not a good long term solution. We have extremely busy lives, and simply cannot give her the attention and exercise that she needs. It wouldn’t be much better than Kate &amp; Nick’s place. 

TL;DR: Baby eye is getting cleaned up, and the dog has been liberated.

EDIT: Thank you to those offering Molly Dog a home and resources! We’ve found a couple of potential adopters for her in our local friend network. In any case, we won’t be adopting her out until we are sure she’s getting the best of the best. 🙏🏼

I think my nephew has ruined kids for me.,"Backstory - I raised my nephew from the age of 4 years to the age of 11. My sister had him at a young age (20). She wanted to go to college and I offered to look after him and raise him while she did. She completed her Bachelors and Masters degree in accounting a few years ago. She received a job, but she was required to travel a lot  while in a staff position so I held on to him until she was promoted to being Manager. Now, she's hardly travelling and my nephew is 11, he moved to live with her this past summer. 

I'm not going to lie, there are times when I miss the little bugger, but I will say that this is the 1st time in a long time where I felt truly free and I love it. I always thought that I wanted kids one day, but after putting in 7 years of being a single parent to my nephew, whew, I really think I'm good on my own. It's a crap ton of work, I always knew that before, but thinking that you know and actually doing it is two completely different story. 

Now  I am getting calls from him asking if he can come visit and I'm trying to find all sorts of excuse to say no, lol. Am not even sure why I posted, just to let you guys know that being childless is a blessing and being a parent is every bit as hard or even harder than you are currently thinking",childfree

“I’m thinking I should just get raped and get pregnant”...,"...“So that I can tell them how much I love them to have them after that”.

HOLY FUCK LADY! WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?

Twice a month my company has a meeting with everyone in the office, about 35 people. A group of women probably 18-25 were sitting in the row behind me and the seats beside me.

They were talking about how much they wanted a kid/second kid. Guessing what order people in the office would get pregnant. Talking about their ovulation cycles and fucking their boyfriends/husbands at certain times of the month. Talking about being ‘fertilized’ and ‘bred’. Fucking puke. I’m glad I was facing away from them, I wasn’t able to hide the disgust on my face.

Then one chick blurts out the rape line. Seriously? You want a fuck trophy so badly that you’re willing to get raped to have it? Not even willing, but WANTING?

I’ve been at this job for about 6 weeks. Between these girls fantasizing about rape babies and the constant screaming infants and toddlers in the office (I’m in the construction industry...this may be an office but it’s no place for a child) I’m at my wits end. Every sound a child makes sounds like hellfire to me, and headphones can only drown out so much.

I work with lots of Mormons and other baby crazy people. I haven’t had to tell anyone yet that I’ll never have children...I’ve avoided that conversation since I know they’ll look down on me afterwards.

Why do breeders think it’s okay to subject other people to this kind of shit? I don’t want to hold your baby. I don’t want to hear your toddler scream. I don’t want to listen to your rape baby fantasies. I come to work to work, not to bow down to your breeder ideals. I could be so much more efficient than I am, but I can only do so much work with children screaming for 3 hours straight and the people beside me talking about literal breeding.

I hate parents/want-to-be parents. I hate their children. I was already sure of my CF stance and sterile before I started this job, but holy fuck that stance has only been solidified in fucking concrete over the last 6 weeks.",childfree

"Pregnant friend upset that I'm not being ""sensitive"" to her complaints about pregnancy.","My newly pregnant friend is going through the general symptoms of being pregnant, like nausea, swollen ankles, and painful breasts. She's upset that I haven't been able to sympathize with her as someone who would never, under any circumstances make the choice to get pregnant.

I have no idea what she'd like me to say to her; I told her long before this that I would never want to be pregnant because I consider it endless suffering. Somehow she thought I'd change my mind after she got pregnant and is - wait for it - going through endless suffering!

I can't say, 'aw it'll get better' in good conscience because it won't. She'll give birth, probably tear her taint, leak breastmilk on all her nice clothes, and pee on herself when she laughs for the rest of her life. And that's if everything goes according to plan. She'll have a sick, tired, screaming baby at some point, a toddler who is a constant liability, a child who will lie to her face, and a teen that may steal or sneak out. That's what having kids is, endless suffering. I don't think a spaghetti sauce covered smile, or macaroni glued to a scribbled card make up for that. 

She can't say that I've changed on her, and certainly can't call me jealous (I'm also in a long term relationship and I get nagged all the time for grandkids from my MIL-to-be). It's not like having children is a special privelege only the best people get chosen for. I'm not the one to say, 'oh I can't wait for it to be me' because that's simply not the case.",childfree

I swear they made their daughter (a year ish) say bye like 7 times,   then when I thought FOR SURE he was leaving (because he got up and did the bye thing AGAIN) he looked at me like I was supposed to applaud his daughter and seemed shocked that I just wanted his seat.  I wasn't a ahole just stealing seats either because he paid his tab and was standing saying bye. But for some reason everyone's supposed to be impressed by kids (I wasn't). 

Same thing when people bring their kids somewhere and walk around and expect everyone to be impressed (work, or group settings). I go to the bathroom right before they get to me because I feel like a a-hole not oooing and ahhing over it.

Breeder SIL already ruining the holidays,"My husband’s sister is already making the holidays unbearable. She’s currently 8 months pregnant  and has 2 biological children and 3 step children. 

She sent a huge wall of text to the family group chat saying she wants to have Thanksgiving at her house this year because she’ll have a ~2 week old baby and doesn’t want to travel. And she expects me and my MIL to do all the cooking AND clean her house for her before hand because of the baby. She has 2 teenagers and a 20 year old that live there and can help her but no. She’s doesn’t want to “ruin their Thanksgiving breaks”, so only me and MIL can do anything.

I told her that my husband and I will be with my family for Thanksgiving for a number of reasons, including the fact that my dad is having surgery the Monday before Thanksgiving and that my grandpa and I always have a mini joint birthday party for our November birthdays after Thanksgiving dinner. 
SIL threw a fit saying that “holidays are for family” 

**record scratch** So my family doesn’t count as family? Apparently husband and I aren’t a “real family” until we have kids and we should do whatever is easiest for the ones with kids (aka the REAL families). 

At this point, MIL intervenes and blames SIL’s pregnancy hormones and asks if we could do a family dinner the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Sure. We can be back for that.

Then SIL has the audacity to ask if I can come early that day to clean AND THEN if I could throw her a fucking baby shower between now and when the baby is born because she’s still missing stuff for the nursery.

Y’all. I just can’t. I’ve muted the chat. I don’t even want to be around any of them. Her step kids are the worst-behaved screeching demons and everything will be focused on the new baby. But her entitlement takes the fucking cake.

Never been BINGO’d,"That pretty much says it all. 

I (33F) was married for 3 years. I wanted a child of my own at the time. It was the thing to do. Get married, have kids. I had 3 step children. One of which had Down Syndrome and ODD. (Oppositional defiant disorder). 

Basically that means that EVERYTHING is a fight. From what you eat. To not running in the street and getting hit by cars. To putting on shoes. Everything.  My inability to parent this child was a big reason for my eventual divorce. 

I also have a history of alcoholism in my family (myself, my mother, and uncle) and have bipolar disorder. 

I decided after I divorced to remain CF. 

No one cares. When I explain that I don’t think I’m mentally prepared to have a child with special needs and that I don’t think my genes give a child the optimum chance for success, people just generally say ‘fair enough’ and move on with their lives.

I'm talking drugs, 3 children under the age of five with all different fathers, massive financial debts, and many legal troubles.

Insurance Coverage for Bilateral Salp.,"Hi guys! In my last post I mentioned that I will be getting my bilateral salpingectomy procedure on October 28th and I couldn't be more excited! Right now, I am covered through the Wisconsin Medicaid BadgerCare plan until November 1st. I've been on the phone on and off for the last two days with the doctor, hospital billing department, and my insurance to figure out if it is covered or not and nobody is giving me any kind of answer. All I was told by my doctor was that no pre authorization was required so does that mean it should be covered? Medicaid wouldn't give me any type of billing information. Anyone dealt with Medicaid before for this procedure? Should it be covered aside from any copays? I did fill out the consent form for the state over 30 days ago so that shouldn't be an issue. I'm just really stressed and frustrated because I feel like I'm so close to getting this yet there seems to be so many barriers I have to keep jumping over. Thanks loves &lt;3",childfree

"""You don't want children!? YOU MUST BE A MURDERER""","Just a quick one from me, it made me laugh so much I thought I'd share. Wasn't sure what to flair this as but it made me laugh so I went with that.

Was doing some shopping today in my local town centre, there was some religious folk there with a speakerphone screaming the words of their god and how everyone is going to hell etc etc, this is quite normal here (it's also the same place I met that other screecher I've mentioned before who told me that ""Rape was Gods Way of telling a woman to bare young"").

One of them comes over as I'm passing and tries to strike up a conversation with me. She spies some chocolate in my shopping bag and jokingly asks ""Ooh, treat for the children?""

I replied no and that I have no kids, she immediately asks me why because they're ""gods creation"" and it's my ""obligation"" to have some to continue my families genes and make them proud.

I managed to get ""I don't like kids-"" out before she immediately cut me off and started screaming at me, saying that hating kids is akin to being a murderer and that I must lure kids in and kill them with my ""Deadly Chocolate"".

I just burst into hysterics and continued to laugh until she shut up. It was so pathetic, ooooh big scary child free Commander 5AM they're going to harm your children because they don't like them! Beware!!!

"Parents, children deserve better","One of the reasons I decided to be child free is because I couldn't bear bringing someone into this world unless I was completely prepared mentally and financially, to care for them in all the ways they deserve to be. Yes, kids can be little monsters but what makes me furious is when parents have children with such reckless abandon that they introduce them into horrid conditions.

Conditions that scar them mentally and physically, leaving them with trauma they didn't ask for. Blaming their kids for every bad thing that happens in their life, even if it wasn't their fault. Introducing them to poverty even though they knew they couldn't afford to have them. Not wanting children at all and, instead, tossing them aside like they're objects. It is infuriating.

Childfree is absolutely fine. Having kids is absolutely fine --- I just don't want them because I understand that my life doesn't have room or preparation for them. But to the people who continue to have them, KNOWING that they will grow up in squalor, KNOWING that the family is in shambles and will not offer support, KNOWING  that the children will be tossed between two parents who treat them as a weapon against the other --- I don't know how you make that decision.

I've had friends who grew up damn near without a family to speak of and they have wanted to end their lives because of their upbringing, wishing they were never born into that environment and doomed to a future based on a past they never asked for. I know this isn't a usual post for this sub but I get so tired of the kids being used as pawns or treated with the same, if not less, importance as pets by those who choose to have them.

If you're going to have kids, be ready to take care of them. There is NO excuse that you shouldn't be giving everything you have to make sure that the children you have are given the best care you can possibly provide.

I would rather choose NOT to have kids and have a fruitful, free life rather than have children and create a breeding ground for trauma for everyone involved.

"I had 4 miscarriages in my early twenties, and I'm so goddamn glad.","When I was 19 I was depressed and hit with baby fever like crazy. Thinking back, I cringe real hard because I was NOT in a good place financially and I would most definitely have been an abusive mother (in the sense that I didn't even have patience for myself, much less for children). It took a lot of therapy over the years to recognize that abuse doesn't happen overnight, it takes a while to creep in and normalize your actions and thoughts. And I would have been, eventually, a terrible mother no matter how good my intentions were in the moment. 

The first time I had a miscarriage at 20, I cried a lot. It was very bloody, pretty traumatic. I hadn't been necessarily trying for a baby, but I wasn't actively preventing it either. Then I had my second miscarriage at 21, less tears, more ""maybe it'll work next time"" thoughts. At 23 I had my third, and found out that I had a severe form of PCOS and the likelihood of a fetus successfully attaching to the walls of my uterus were slim due to lacking a very important enzyme in my body. I remember feeling somewhat numb in the moment, but also a tinge of relief in the back of my head. I decided to stop focusing on babies and focus more on enjoying life in the moment. And then the 4th miscarriage, at 24. And honestly? When I found out I was pregnant beforehand, for the first time i had thought ""wait, shit..."" So I was... extremely relieved. 

And that was a huge wakeup call. I talked to my mother, who had 6 children herself, about these feelings. She'd never pushed the idea of having children onto me, very much a ""I'm happy if you're happy"" kind of person. And she said ""This gives you a chance to live the kind of life I never could now. And I'll always love you, no matter what you choose."" 

It had seemed that fate and the universe were speaking to me, because I fell in love with a man who'd gotten a vasectomy many years before we'd met. I found a partner coming to the same conclusion as myself. 

I had the potential of having an 8, 7, 5, and 4 year old child right now. And instead, I was cut some cosmic slack.

And I am so fucking glad they were never born.

Coworker spent an HOUR in the backroom trying to convince me to love children.,"So, I’m at work and I have to be in the backroom to clean. It generally does take an hour or two to do this, as we have to make sure everything is sanitary.

I’m scrubbing, cleaning, moving things, trash, compost, etc. 

He’s an older gentleman and usually he’s very kind and considerate.

When it comes to things he believes, however... He likes to spend a great deal of time trying to convince people of his ways.

(i.e. Our boss is atheist and CF, I’m agnostic, and this coworker likes to pester him and me about it).

Anyway. So I’m cleaning the backroom. And he brings up children again.

My answer and response is, “no. I hate children.”

He goes on to say that I’m changing and that I’m still young.

“I fucking hate children.”

“I pray that you become a preschool teacher and change.”

“That’s like praying for someone who wants kids to go sterile. You’re basically hoping their life will be ruined.”

He gives me a funny, confused look. Then he goes, “You will change and we will come back to this years later.”

“My boyfriend is having a vasectomy.”

“Vasectomies can fail.”

“I’m getting my tubes tied.”

“That can also fail.”

“Thankfully, abortion usually doesn’t.”

Now he looked extremely hurt. “No... you don’t have it in you to do that.”

Firmly: “Yes, I do.”

“... No, I don’t believe that.” (Still hurt).

“So why do I have Planned Parenthood’s phone number and address on my phone? I’ve made an appointment before when I had a pregnancy scare.”

Realization dawns upon him that I would, in fact, get an abortion.

“Before you do that... hold the baby in your arms for a couple of days.”

“No. That baby will die before it gets the chance to reach the outside world. I’m not having some stupid, annoying, needy little crotch goblin fucking up my body and my life.”

He looks sad, and before you harp too much on me for being harsh, let me remind you that he hadn’t let up for a whole ass 45 minutes and I was getting pissed.

I mean, it got to the point where I had just repeatedly said “I don’t want children/I fucking hate children” in response very quickly to whatever he said.

But he didn’t get it. He eventually gave up, but for some reason, he didn’t get it...

I was so irritated the next day at work. I told one of my bosses (not the CF one) about it (venting) and he goes, “Well it’s usually then ones who are most adamant about it that end up changing their minds.”

I instantly shoot him a look and open my mouth to say something mean, and he catches it and goes, “But I know what you’re saying, yeah.”

God. All these men, if they had to think of their health and their body and their shitty genetics being passed down, they’d think twice before opening their mouths.

(Oh, and YES I am on birth control, so no, abortion is not my go-to, it’s a backup plan. I have an IUD, so I’m good for five years. And yes, I realize men are also CF but I’m speaking about the men at my work, not men in general).

EDIT: Thank you all for the suggestions and the support! This hasn’t been the first time this associate has done this so I decided I would take your advice about HR... and tweak it a bit.

They really are idiots aren't they?,"Ftp, mobile 

Possible TW for mention of graphic images?

This is a bit of a rant, so I apologize if it's jumbled. I had to deal with this on my birthday, so I'm kinda mad.

For context, I go to a very popular junior college in northern California that is known for it's support of at risk and poor students. Like, you can't be expelled for having excessive late fees, only really bad grades and conduct.

With that in mind, I was very suprised and angry to see that there were 2 anti abortion booths set up in the main area where students hang out during lunch. What got me angry was that they put up huge banners with those fake ""this is what an abortion looks like at 10 weeks"" pictures. If you know what I'm talking about, then you know how gross and scientifically incorrect they are. The images were so disturbing that some students put up signs around the area to warn people who may be sensitive to them. 

Now, let me get into the people running the booths.

First of all, it was mostly old white men who were handing out fliers. Second, all of there arguments were emotional (pathos) and not logical (logos). Seriously, if our school debate team was there, the people in the booths would have been decimated. A medical student went up to them to explain that that is not what a 10 week old fetus looks like. They told her she was wrong. She is literally studying this stuff! Third, they were extremely rude. I tried to just walk by and not give them any attention, but this ""conversation"" happened.

Booths idiot (BI): Would you like a panflet?

Me: I support planned parenthood 

BI: But this is about jesus!

Me: I am a pagan 

BI: Oh wow, you are really down there!

I just...you do not know how to persuade people do you? You are both insulting my reproductive rights and my religion. Really? 

Thankfully, a bunch of students saw these people and created pro choice signs and stood around the booths. One guy even got a kazoo and started dancing around them. It was hilarious. These people really are idiots if they think their message would be well received in very liberal northern California.

I’m 18, but I’ve always labeled myself as CF. I would definitely rather have my dogs and money than a crotch goblin. I’m a selfish person sometimes, and I admit that. I don’t think I could handle being a parent and I wouldn’t want to put an innocent child through that. 
However, every time I say I don’t want kids, the response I get is “oh, you’ll change your mind when you’re older,” “you’d be a great mom though!” Or “you wouldn’t make a good mom anyways.”
The first one ticks me off because no, I don’t think I’ll change my mind because I don’t want to be a baby factory. The second one is kind of a compliment I guess? I’m decent with kids. I treat them like mini adults because that’s what they’re gonna be one day and there is no reason to treat them like they’re incompetent creatures. Plus, some kids are hilarious and I know mine would be. 
The last one is what really gets me. If I ever do have a kid (I like the idea of fostering kids bc the system is so screwed up that kids need somewhere they feel safe and loved and I could offer that), I would be a dang good mom. Like okay, Karen, you talk to your child like it’s stupid and I’ve seen you yell at it more times than I could count for something simple, but I would be the bad mom? My dogs are being treated better and living better than your bad ass kids, but go off I guess. 
Not really a rant but I had to get that off my chest. Why are people’s responses so insanely different when you say you’re CF? Ugh",childfree
My Maid of Honor can't leave her child for 4 days for my wedding,"I'm going to go on a small rant about my wedding and would love to hear comments and advice about how to handle this situation from like-minded individuals. I considered posting in other subreddits, but I honestly don't want to hear sappy stories about children at weddings.

I am getting married next year in Costa Rica. My maid of honor (MOH) had a baby last December and I adore her and her baby is pretty okay. However, trying to explain to her that I do not want kids – not even hers – at my wedding has been exhausting. She continues to come up with various plans to make it so we can accommodate her baby and does not seem to get the point that my fiance and I do not want kids there. She told me last week that she doesn’t think that she will be ready to leave her baby by the time of my wedding (even though he will be almost two by this point in time) and I don’t understand how she can’t leave the baby for 4 days. She has more than enough options as her parents, her husband’s parents, and her brother’s family all live in town. The area we are getting married is not appropriate for a toddler and we already have other family members on my fiance's side that we have told cannot bring their children and they have opted out of going.

My fiance and I are both CF and he really doesn't like kids. I feel like I'm stuck between choosing between my fiance's wishes for our wedding and having my best friend by my side.",childfree
I matter more than grandchildren,"So I’ve been living with a chronic illness where I have to take medicine that would be toxic to a fetus. Yes, I COULD take an alternative, but it would fuck up my body big time. My mother knows my stance on children (tails only), and supports it. Recently she came out with “I’d rather have my daughter healthy than have grandchildren”. She’s even offered to pay for tubal if I want to go that route! This is the same lady who made excuses to spend all her free time with my nephew when he was born and basically had her life revolving around diaper changes and picture books again (voluntarily). She’s come a long way in the last decade, and I am very lucky.",childfree
Don’t know where else to post this....,"Can’t tell family as we don’t have answers. 

Can’t tell my SO cause I don’t want him anxious next to me in the ER. 

My grandma (adoptive/guardian mom) that I’ve been taking care of had a possible stroke this morning getting into the truck. I was essentially the first responder getting her into a proper position, monitoring heart rate, checking visual tracking, “squeeze my hand if” etc. 

No response. Drooling, trouble breathing. No response. 

I told her how much I loved her sitting in the truck waiting for the ambulance. 

In the waiting room. They are only letting grandpa back there. I’m expecting the worst. 

And to tie it all back to Childfree for the mods: Who is gonna take care of you when you’re older? It doesn’t fucking matter. So live your life the way you want.

UPDATE: C02 overdose, not a stroke. EMS thought it was a stroke so I was absolutely in the right field of diagnosis. Can’t confirm until tests are run which they were and it was negative. 

She’s getting admitted.

UPDATE 2: she’s awake and responsive. No damage from the CO2. Bitching about the damn mask on her face. So I feel a lot better. But yeah... thinking your mom is dying is a weird feeling. Coming off of that feeling is weirder. I wouldn’t wish this limbo of hell on anyone.",childfree
I had a dream about a CF airline last night,"Cocktails and coffee were served all around. The in-flight entertainment was a raunchy comedian that swore a lot.

Questioning,"Does this happen to anyone else? I'm staunchly CF (in my late 20s now and have never wanted children, even when I was younger). I get bingoed all the time, obviously. I enjoy spending my time with my niece (and sometimes my nephew) and some of my friends are starting to have kids who I love and see every once in a while (thankfully the moms so far still have lives besides their kid). 

*But*... every once in a while I will get a little... feeling of doubt and wonder if I really will regret it in 5, 10, 15 years that I don't have children. And I question if I would maybe want to once I'm more financially stable, etc. 

And then I plan a trip with my SO and have to find someone to watch our dog and cat and remember how much harder that would be if it was a child. Or I go to Sephora and drop $100 and think that I would have to be buying diapers and clothes every other day. Or sleep in on a Sunday and spend my morning drinking coffee in bed and reading. And all those  doubts go away.",childfree
I’ve Come To A Realization,"My boyfriend is very against having kids. I was as well since I was kid (10). My mom would ask what would I would do if I ever got pregnant. My answer was always abortion or put it up for adoption. I didn’t want kids period. Of course she was disappointed and told me that was bad.  She never pulled the “I want grandkids” line but she said she was like me once and how she has 4 kids. “The ones who claim to never want kids, are always the one who has the most”.

Over the years, I’d see others with their babies and think “yea, maybe I’ll adopt one. The same was done for me.” Then my grand aunts were disappointed, since it wouldn’t really be part of the family. Especially when my cousins of the same age were already having kids. 

Yesterday I babysat my cousin’s 6 month girl. It was hell. She was cute, but then she kept crying and pooping. She’d cry when Peppa Pig wasn’t on loop. My cuz thought it was a good idea to put her on mushy/solid food so her diapers stink worse. I had to have my roommate clean that. I stuck to my 19 year oath of NEVER cleaning a poopy diaper. 

So this guaranteed I’m never having kids, I’m just getting a dog.  Or three.",childfree
Sister almost died during childbirth. My mom still thinks she should have more.,"This is my first time actually posting on this subreddit and I just got off working my night shift so I apologize if it's a mess. 

About a year, almost two years ago, my sister gave birth to my nephew and she almost died. There were a bunch of complications when she went into labor and she almost bled to death. Afterwards my sister decided to get snipped so she wouldn't risk getting pregnant and almost dying again. 

At this time she had also just finished divorcing her (p.o.s. I hope someone is stomping on your grave) husband and she was most definitely not ever planning on having more kids even if she remarried. Fast forward to the other day when my mother and I were discussing a potential man my sister was somewhat interested in. My mom says ""well if HE wants kids she can always just try to get her surgery reversed""....WHY? NO. JUST NO. SHE ALMOST DIED FOR FRICK FRACK SAKE!! NO ONE CARES IF HE WANTS KIDS!! HER KIDS ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH! But most important of all, she doesn't want more kids! My mom was almost offended when I said ""absolutely not. She almost died. That is ridiculous."" I just couldn't believe she's actually suggest my sister endanger her life for something so unnecessary.

Why is it that all they care about is being able to pop out babies? It's like they don't care if you almost die or ruin your body. The only thing that matters is that barely-in-existence baby. I'm so tired of hearing people prioritize popping out crotchfruit over the woman's mental, physical and emotional well-being. It's like ""Who gives a shit you almost died!! This random man you're just slightly interested in could possibly want babies!! Put your life at risk!""

I don't know if maybe I'm being dramatic, but the complete lack of care for women's bodily autonomy is yet another reason to add onto my ever growing list of why I will never have children. Thanks for listening to my long rant. Hope y'all have a wonderful bingo-free day. :)",childfree
Denied Tubal because my doctor changed HIS mind about being CF,"Want to preface this by saying that I (F/22)  have a few medical conditions that makes having children detrimental to my body/health. So coupled with not liking kids and my fiancé and I both individually deciding we want to remain CF, I’m ready to be fixed and be done with it. 

So I made an appointment for a consult with my doctor for permanent birth control.

It started off by him walking into the room and saying how interesting my medical history is. (I have Factor V Leiden which means taking birth control can cause blood clots, so condoms or sterilization is the only thing that will work for my partner and I.) So I’m thinking it’s going great. 

Then, he hits me with, “you know, I was in your same boat when I was 22. Had my vasectomy scheduled and was ready. Now I have 6 kids, HAHAHAHA.” He finds this hysterical, I don’t crack a smile. I stare directly at him. He finally stops laughing and says “but you know, you’re young. When you start your career, find the right person,  you might change your mind! I like to give everyone the chance to change their mind like I did.” 

2 things wrong with this: A. I am ENGAGED to my high school sweetheart of SIX YEARS THANK YOU!! My doctor KNOWS I’m engaged, so he basically told me keep searching until I find someone who wants kids. And B. WHY on God’s green Earth would I want to start my career and then have a kid!? His arguments were not valid at all. 

My frustration at this point was boiled over. I walked out without even getting the flu shot I told the nurse I wanted because I was so upset. This is like me saying “you don’t like peanut butter? I didn’t either, now I love it! I’m going to feed you peanut butter and maybe you can change your mind.” 

Thank you for letting me vent, CF community. Back to the drawing board in search of a new doctor...",childfree
What to do with too much housing space?!,"Here’s a strange issue I’ve been having: living in family suburbia and house hunting in family suburbia- all houses are basically designed for family suburbia. Even the small houses designs I’ve been looking at.

Poland wants to punish those that teach sexual education with 5 years in jail,"Abortion is absolutely illegal, female sterilisation is ABSOLUTELY illegal because it is a HUGE ""demage to health"", you can get morning-after pill only when prescripted and doctors can DENY you that because it basically hurts their feelings, from what i heard some doctors deny contraceptive pills (?? what the fuck?), and now they want to ban sexual education because it is ""pedophilia"" - as they say. They are talking about putting teachers in JAIL for 5 years if they do. This is not settled yet but they want to do it. What the fuck? What the actual fuck? They pay people for having children - literally, m o n t h l y. People can quit their job just because they have children! And now they don't want to educate young people about sex and contraceptives so they would GET fucking PREGNANT. I see no other reason really. Pedophilia? How? Are you insane?   


So let me get this straight. Poland wants everyone to BREED like fucking RABBITS and punish those that don't want to have children. Great. And the rest of the world doesn't even know about this nonsense. I really believe that this law about banning sexual education won't work because people will protest BUT just think about how insane everything in here is. As a CF person I am just scared. Poland is not some poor, stupid country without internet or something but from what you see we certainly behave like we are still hundreds of years behind.",childfree
I'm dreading because of bingos...,"I am 20F, full time student. I've been lurking this sub for a long time and I, as many people here, am CF and constantly being bingo'd, especially by their family members and relatives.

My mother (45) is not religious, she's just very... old-fashioned. She believes a woman's duty is to get married, have at least 2 kids and serve her husband while still maintaining a decent job. As my parents got divorced when I was 7, my sister was a month old and my mother raised us by her own since then, I am completely baffled by this mindset of her. She said ""That's how women secure their happiness. If you don't do exactly that, you're 'social garbage' living unworthy life and you're being ungrateful and disrespectful to your parents 'cause they've sacrificed to give you this life."" I, on the other hand, believe everybody can find their own happiness in anything. You don't have to get married AND have kids to feel contented.

One of my ex-classmates (20F) recently got married (oh I'll save this story for next time). My mom, despite not knowing a thing about this girl, showered her with compliments of how ""mature and responsible"" she was.

My mom is totally baby rabies. Sometimes a bit extreme. She'd drop everything for a baby, be it one of my relatives' child or a complete stranger's. Yesterday we were just picking some stuff at a convenience store and there was this lady with her son who was about 2-3 years old. My mother was basically fawning over this kid, constantly following his mom to talk with her and asking to hold him. He was a very loud kid too. His mother and he happened to be in front of us in line waiting to check out. He couldn't decide which milk to take and kept switching one to another making us wait for roughly 15 minutes. He also screamed and yelled to get his mom's attention. Still my mother was like ""Isn't he adorable?"" I was speechless.

She's also crazy about my cousins' kids. She wanted to be the first person to see the kids once they are born. One time I was sick and bedridden at home (I live with my mother), one of my cousins was in hospital giving birth that same day. My mom didn't waste any second rushing to the hospital to see ""the little angel"". She didn't mind paying for my cousins' children's diapers, baby food, all kinds of essential things for babies. She held them, fed them and played with them at every family gathering. She usually video chats with the cousins just to see the kids.

Every time I'm vocal about not having children, she gets very offensive. She said she ""didn't raise her daughter to say such things"" and told me I was delusional because ""every woman wants to and HAS TO have kids"". ""You despicable little cunt! (yep, her exact words) You're gonna regret it and don't come crying to Mama about it!"" Oh mom, I'm certain I won't.

We were watching the news while eating dinner one day. They were talking about an anti-abortion law (I don't remember in which country exactly). They said that under no circumstances can the woman get an abortion, even if the unborn child is a result of incest, rape,... My mother was like ""Now they are doing the right thing!"" I got kinda pissed and told her ""How can you force someone to bear a child they don't consent!?"" She yelled in my face ""That's just how it is! The woman simply has to accept it without questioning!"" I was beyond shocked and disgusted at that point.

My mother isn't the only bingoer. Few months ago I was invited to my aunt's house for dinner. I'm not a picky eater, I just eat small portions. My aunt noticed this and she joked (or so I thought) ""If you eat that little, your future husband won't have to be worried to support you and your kids!"" I smiled and said ""I make my own money to support myself."" My aunt just laughed ""Yeah right"".

These are just some ""highlights"" and I KNOW that there's plenty more in the future lol.",childfree
Demanding grandkids has evolved to guilt tripping,"Long time lurker. Previously posted a topic. Just look for it in my profile :)


English is my second language but I still suck at it every now and then. 


I'm an only child. It's very difficult to be an only child in a family that believes a woman's fulfillment will be achieve ONLY once she has a litter of kids. At some point I did want kids but after years of having to take care of tiny goblins without pay nor early notice has made me not want any. Plus, I can't have any kids anyway. The internal organ I need for reproduction did not develop properly. 


My parents are aware of the last sentence My OBY/GYN even told them about it. Not sure if that's legal or not...



Anyway, I recently had a ""talk"" with my mother. I've told her before I NEVER want kids but you know this is her answer everytime I say I don't want kids:


""But who will take care of you when you get old?""


I'll hire people to take care of me.


""Aren't you jealous of your childhood friends? You're at the age to have kids in a few years!""


Hahaha no.

You’re a women and you will have kids,"Hello,
This is my first time posting and sorry if the format is weird I’m on mobile.

To start off for years I’ve been struggling with my (N 25) gender and it wasn’t until I was finally an adult that I realize that I am non-binary and that I might go through some transition. 
Not only did I struggle with my gender I also struggled with not wanting kids since I was young and dealt with an abusive mother as well as a abusive boyfriend who became my fiancé I stayed with for almost 5yrs (I was young and scared of being alone) I never liked kids nor am I good with them but I always felt pressured.

It wasn’t until I found this sub that helped reaffirm my decision on not wanting them and also the fact I finally got away from my ex but I still have to deal with my mother occasionally since I live with my grandmother still.

Anyways sorry for the ramble but I felt like that was needed as a bit of background to help with my story.

About a week ago I had officially changed my name to something I’ve been wanting for years. This was also the time I decided to come out as non-binary and my name change  to my family (everyone else like friends and coworkers already knew and have been supportive). 

My family(mostly mother) except my brother was livid hearing about this and have been bingo me nonstop about how I am a women and how I’m made to have a baby and how they’ll never call me by my pronouns and new name. Apparently I was given my body, gender and name from god himself.

This isn’t the first time  they’ve bingo me ever since when my cousin who never wanted kids finally had one and because of that I should be the next one in line. 

I’ve been getting texts nonstop about this from my family about how I am women and nothing else which means I should have a child. 

It’s been exhausting dealing with this, I wish I could cut them off but living with my grandmother it’s hard.

Sorry for the ramble but I feel like this was the sub that would be right to share.",childfree
Wanted to see a Broadway show... turns out to be a breeder fantasy... UGH,"My wife and I recently got into Broadway shows and we want to see more. We heard a few songs from musicals like “Dear Evan Henson” and “Waitress” and both shows seem like they’re good.

Welp, I just read the synopsis of “Waitress” and it’s a breeder fairytale. UGH!

*SPOILERS BELOW, YOU’VE BEEN WARNED*

To make it short, it’s about a young waitress who also bakes pies at the diner she works at, she’s married to an abusive husband, becomes pregnant by him, decides to keep baby even though he’s a piece of shit, he controls her into giving him half her earnings since he was fired, also makes her promise she will love him more than the baby, and she also has an affair with her OB/GYN doctor...

At the end, the abusive husband leaves, she stops seeing the doctor, she then opens her diner (or bake shop, whatever) and she lives happily ever after with her daughter.

Really? 😒 All a breeder fairytale...

These types of stories kill me because my mother was married to my father whose an abusive narcissist.

I have to see two psychologists to prove I'm not crazy before the doctor will yeet my tubes.,"Twenty days ago, I [posted a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/d9irwm/i_have_a_bisalp_surgery_date/) here saying I'd just seen a gyno who had given me a surgery date for a bisalp—it was my first visit to a gyno on the road to sterilisation, and I couldn't believe it happened so quickly. It seemed almost too good to be true.

Well, the joke's on fuckin little old me, because it WAS.

First of all, the doctor's secretary told me she'd send through the pricing information within 24 hours. When it hadn't arrived a few days later, I rang, and she said the doctor was just following up on a few things and it'd come through soon. 

I had an appointment with my psychologist a week after my appointment with the gyno, and in our session I mentioned I had approval for my surgery and was really happy about it. She got this puzzled look on her face and my heart sank.

""Well,"" she said, ""I actually got a call from their office yesterday, wanting some paperwork from me saying I approved of you getting the surgery or something like that. I told them I couldn't do that.""

I wasn't surprised that she'd denied them—if the request was phrased like that, it was not really medically appropriate for her to 'approve' the surgery—but I was more surprised that the gyno had contacted my psych... behind my back. I'd mentioned to the gyno that I had been seeing a psych for ten years, the same psych, and the gyno noted down her name but I thought nothing of it. She certainly didn't say she'd be ringing my psychologist, or contacting her in any way, and seeing as my psychologist isn't really relevant to the surgery it felt almost... inappropriate? It pissed me off, but I couldn't really put a finger on why.

The gyno herself rang me a few days later and said that she talked to her insurance, and they wouldn't let her do the surgery unless she had a letter from my psychologist stating I was of sound mind and able to make this decision unaffected by my mental illnesses (anxiety and depression—currently extremely well-managed; I'm in remission, if such a thing in this context is possible). Fine. Sounds more like something my psych would be able to help with. I rang my psychologist, told her verbatim what the gyno said, she wrote a letter saying I was of sound mind and was making this decision appropriately and she didn't doubt my conviction.

All good! I thought. I'd finally get that fucking email with the payment information so I could work out how much of my savings I'd have to wave goodbye to. But a few days passed... A week... Nothing.

I rang on Monday. Asked if they'd got the letter from my psych. They said yes, but they didn't think the gyno had looked at it yet. I rang today, which is Wednesday. Asked if the doctor had looked at my letter from my psych yet. Keep in mind my surgery was less than two weeks *to the day* away and I had no payment information, no forms, nothing. I was told the doctor wanted to chat with me about something, she'd call me later in the afternoon, and I spent the rest of my day at work turning myself in knots with nerves.

Well. As it turns out, she's feeling 'very unsure' about doing the surgery. She quoted a bullshit statistic about how 1 in 3 young women who get sterilised regretted it—I should have called her out and asked her what study she was quoting, and rebutted, but I was just too shocked—and she thought that most, if not all, gynecologists would feel the same way. She tried to talk me into a copper IUD, for the third time. I said no, for the third time. She asked why. I told her I'd written about it in the paperwork I'd given her. She said she looked through it, and couldn't see anything about IUDs. So I said—well, risk of perforation. Heavier periods. Being able to feel the strings. And it's not permanent, which is what I WANT. Fine, she said, what about the clips? No, I said, I want the bilateral salpingectomy.

She sighed. Well, she said, in that case, I'm going to have to ask if you'd be willing to see an independent psychologist specialising in fertility options, and see what they say.

I was *seething*. She doesn't trust me, she doesn't trust my fucking psychologist—honestly I'm more upset to the insult to my psych's professionalism than I am about me—and she wants me to see someone else, jump through another fucking hoop, spend more fucking money—for what? I was saying to my partner that she said this psych is independent but given that she's so against this surgery, and has changed her mind, I bet she'll send me to someone who is old-fashioned and thinks that women can't know they don't want children at my age, and will find me medically unfit for the surgery. And then I'll be fucked.

I don't think I've ever been this angry in my life, ever. I have no autonomy over my own body. I seriously doubt a man my age would need to have documentation from two psychologists before he was able to get a vasectomy. It's not fair. It's not fucking *fair*, and I'm fucking sick and tired of it. I don't know what to do except keep playing her game, although who knows, after this maybe she'll want documentation from a psychiatrist as well, or a hypnotherapist, or a fucking massage therapist for all I know. 

Anyway. Sorry. This is super long. I just had to vent my frustrations somewhere I knew I'd be understood ;__;

ETA: woah this blew up overnight. I'm not located in the US, I'm in Australia, we don't have HIPAA, and I'm not sure if what she did violated our patient confidentiality laws (if we have any at a state/federal level).

I think I'm going to write her a complaint letter, and complain to the medical board about her.",childfree
Anxiety attack from Baby shower,"Mini rant here...

I had to attend a baby shower last month. Well, I say HAD  to as I still haven’t found that perfect balance of telling people ‘no’ just yet. (I tend to swing from “Fuck You I’m a straight talking badass bitch!”  type to a meek and demure “yes mam.” wallflower....it’s a work in progress.) 

So the baby shower was for my partners best friend. They’re recently married and just in their newly bought house (they’re both great savers and really nice people.) 

Thing is... I only met them once. At their house warming. A month ago. 

I also suffer from crippling anxiety. Especially when it comes to combining things like baby showers (ew diaper games- vom!) and meeting new people. 

Partner keeps asking if I’m okay to go and I, like my usuals denial-denying self, keep insisting it’s fine when in reality I’d rather gouge my eyes out than go. To make matters worse, a good friend of the pregnant lady (her maid of honour no less) was someone my partner briefly dated before we met is going to be there. No biggie there except she didn’t take their breakup well and started a blog about it constantly referring to my partner as her ‘ex boyfriend ‘. Something that makes him super frustrated as he never asked her officially. (He’s big into “asking when he knows it’s right.”)

Anyways, the day of the baby shower my partner finds out his aunt has passed away and need to attend the funeral three hours cross country. “Yay’ I think to myself “it’s my get out of party ticket.” ......except no. My partner states he wouldn’t want me to miss the party for this and insists I still attend.

Did I speak up and decent my choice?
....did I fuck...

So I get all dolled up, his kinda ex bein there and all. Grab the present (voucher for a well known toy store cos neither of us know what to get.) and a bottle of alcohol free procecco (or two) for myself as I was driving and for the pregnant lady... (I don’t drink much but it’s gotta suck bein pregnant and not having an alternative.)

Drive out only to get stuck in a traffic jam halfway there. Now if anybody else has anxiety PLEASE let me know if being late makes it worse?? Cos being late really makes mine amp up full blast! 
Add in the fact that I’ve only recently started back at college as a mature student and I’m under serious family pressure at home and I was like a pressure cooker about to blow. And the traffic was the last straw. 

I actually pulled up in the estate, nervously sweating, practically hyperventilating and shaking. Then it dawned on me.

I didn’t know which house it was ....

In my panic to get there on time I had forgotten to ask what house number it was.

That’s all it took... the fear of walking up to the wrong house and looking a fool kicked my building anxiety into when turned out to be the biggest attack I had in YEARS.

I literally flung the car into reverse and sped out of the estate, tyres screeching, barely able to see through my tears, just randomly driving. Anywhere. Just fleeing.
Somewhere down the road I let out a primal bloodcurdling scream that chilled me to the bone. Months of buildup just exploded. I flipping between wailing through tears and turning completely stoic as I drove for over two hours along random roads just getting lost. 

All because of a baby shower. 

I don’t like baby’s. Never felt comfortable around them. Don’t think they’re cute and don’t think I want them. (Fence sitter but staring resolutely at the CF side) 

I hate that so much pressure is put on women to breed. I literally would no be happier if I found out tomorrow that I had to have a hysterectomy so then I wouldn’t feel this unending GUILT I have for not wanting kids. For not wanting kids with my partner. For feeling selfish for only wanting dogs or cats or chickens or whatever instead of noisy, smelly, dirty children ruining my life. 

Then I feel mad because I shouldn’t feel guilty for not wanting them. 
I’m tearing myself up inside purely because of society’s views on motherhood and it’s opinion that if you don’t like kids your somehow _broken_??

Like I’m already broken.
My family’s in tatters because of their actions.
My dads instilled this unrelenting nightmare that I’d somehow become the same type of parent as him.(a horrible one.) 

I suffer from extreme anxiety and depression and do NOT want to pass that along to my kids.
This world itself is so, SO fucked between riots and climate change and yet all that seems to matter to my partner is that I pop a baby out somehow inbetween five years of studying to become a vet??

That makes me so mad. 
Then sad because I’ve never been brave enough to voice my opinions so surely like others here have. Sad that I’ve found the perfect partner but because I might not want kids, then I’m not his perfect partner. 
Angry because IVE got to give up a year of my study because HE wants kids?? Yeah maybe I do too someday but I have FINALLY gotten my shit together so don’t you DARE tell me what I’m going to do with my womb thankyouveryfuckingmuch mate. You want kids, you go ahead and carry the little parasites. 


I want a nice home.
I want a job that I love.
I want to travel in renovated camper with our dog and see the world. 
I don’t see kids in that equation. 
I feel like kids would hold me back from that. 

To make matters worse, I couldn’t even tell him how I felt about the baby shower because that would inevitably lead to the break up discussion that I deep down know would happen. I don’t want to lose him yet I’m harbouring so much anger and resentment for this expected duty of me?? And I know it’s only going to get worse.

You know what his reaction was to me not attending the baby shower? Disappointment. 
That I let an anxiety attack get in the way of bein friends with his friends (which I can understand.) but I feel like he brushed aside my feelings in lieu of ‘what would the others think’ kinda attitude. 

Honestly I havnt a clue how t end this... I think this is the only safe place I can come to to vent about things like this without being lynched.

"I realized I love my partner way more than I will ever love a child, but does that make me selfish?","I’m usually a lurker on my phone, but I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while. I hope this is the right place to share this. 

I [22F] have known my boyfriend [22M] since we were both 11. I have loved him since I can remember. We started dating in college. When I was a teenager, I never saw children in my future. I always fantasized about marriage— but never children. I continued into my young adulthood even more certain that I will never have children. I’ve never liked the thought of having my own. Well, ever since I started dating my boyfriend, I’ve become dead set that I will never have kids. Why? Because I literally cannot live with the thought of loving someone more than my boyfriend. I want to marry him and spend the rest of my life loving and compromising with him, but I’m not willing to sacrifice or compromise anything with my said child. Even if my BF and I broke up, I would still want to dedicate my life and heart to whoever I married and refuse to share my love with a kid. 

My boyfriend is equally as child-free minded as I am, maybe even more, but he has different reasons than I for why he will never want kids. Also,  I have more than one reason why I won’t have kids, but this is the one that really solidified my decision. 

Does this make me selfish? This reasoning seems so wrong but it’s the main reason I’m looking into tubal ligation. I have seen other’s reasons for not having children but I feel a little ostracized with my reasoning. 

tldr; I never wanna have a kid cuz I don’t wanna share my spouse. Is that egocentric?",childfree
Tokophobia is ruining my life,"Hello everyone! I've been a member of this awesome community for two years (I've been CF since kid). I want to share my story with you. I'm too scared of pregnancy.

I'm fairly young man who is not the best person on this world. I now live with my gf of 4 years and I love her, she is the best for me.

Since we've started living together (we don't have sex, both don't want it), we started experiencing first things. Suddenly everything became source of worries and anxiety.

I can't even ""touch"" her without being worried of accidental pregnancy (yeah yeah, I know it's almost impossibile without PIV), I look at her and become sad almost instantly because what I'm doing to her.

Today I took my decision: stop ""touching"" each other or sleeping together. She was very hurt but I can't live with the thought of a possibile monster ruining both of our lives. Probably she will left me soon.

I'm suicidal (yeah yeah, I know I need attention) and I think a pregnancy would bring me to death. A vasectomy is out of option because I'm too young (I would need to be 30 to be taken seriously) for doctors and there aren't CF doctors near me.

We are not fucking ableist,"You CANNOT go around and preach how able-bodied people (if that's even the right expression) are privileged and later get pissed when someone doesn't want to bring a child into an existence of suffering if there is a (high) possibility that child will be born with a disease or a disability. It's basic fucking compassion to not want to condemn someone to a life full of pain and misery that they didn't consent to, you selfish prick.

What WOULD be ableist is if someone birthed a sick/disabled child and hated, abused and neglected them because of it. Big fucking difference.

"I'm (23M) haunted by the ""what if?""","Hello,

I've been pondering the idea of being CF for a few years now, as I have never seen kids in my future. This has only been exacerbated by the increased likelihood that we will not address climate change in time to mitigate the effects it will have on future generations.
However, even prior to that realisation I just never liked the idea of having kids. I enjoy the idea of having time and financial freedom to pursue my own goals on life and advance in the ways that I see as fulfilling - all of which do not include kids.

I've been tossing up whether or not to have a vasectomy over the past few months, after a pregnancy scare I had with a girl I am seeing! Don't worry, it was a false alarm. But when that happened all I felt was dread. Not because I wasn't financially secure, but because of the world I was bringing the person into, and the lack of freedom I would now be faced with.


It would also bring me a lot of sexual relief too! I have a lot of casual partners and despite using protection, am ALWAYS anxious about pregnancy. I always get anxious after sex for that reason too.

 The more I think about it, the more I really want to go ahead and get it done! But I know that I am young at only 23 years old. And while I feel resolute about having it done, I can't help but question 'what if'.

What if in 10 years time I feel the want to have my own children. Will 33 year old me regret what I do today? That's such a large time period, and much can change in that time period too, regardless of how resolute I feel.


Does anyone have any advice? Or have had similar experiences?

TLDR: Wanna get a vasectomy, but I'm worried I'll regret it when I'm older!",childfree
''I still want children even though I can't financially support them'',"Before my rant I just want to say THANK YOU! I absolutely love this thread. It is such a joy discovering so many like-minded sane people! Now unto this ear-vomit:

Had a chat with one of my acquaintances today (I think she’s around 25 but not entirely sure) She’s currently looking for a job and has basically been offered two very different job opportunities. First opportunity: A less-interesting job (but still very interesting in her opinion) earning her a decent amount of money that will allow her to set enough money aside to save up for her long-time dream of having multiple kids, a house and everything in-between within the next 3-4 years together with her partner of 4 years. (I’m CF myself but hey, if that is her dream I think it is a reasonable way to plan it at least - especially if her partner is in on this)

OR 

she could take the other job opportunity: A 3-year contracted job which ‘’seems like more fun’’ according to her, but will basically make her do free-labor as they’ll pay her NEXT TO NOTHING, with almost no paid maternity leave. Taking this job will pretty much make her and her partner live on the poverty line having to rely on benefits from the state (He’s a student at the moment and has many years to go still). Now, if this is her passion and if she really thinks this job if the most exciting thing to do, I respect that - but here’s the kicker: She is STILL planning on having kids and buy a house within the next 3-4 years! And she believes that her and her partner ‘’will just have to make it work somehow’’ Either by her partner quitting his degree and just start working to support her dream of being a mom with a fun job or him at least doing part time so he can support her partially. She literally wants it all - I sat there completely flabbergasted and REALLY tried to make her understand how completely irresponsible this thinking is and she just brushed it off because ‘’everyone else makes it work with kids so why shouldn’t they be able to’’

What the hell is it with people?! As soon as they get the idea of breeding all logic goes to hell and you are the pessimistic asshole for stating the fucking obvious. Despite her asking for my opinion!

Baby shower,"We’ve been invited to a baby shower, my partner and I like everyone on this forum really want nothing to do with babies / kids / talking about them. Just not how I want to spend my day. Baby shower is of a good friend of ours but my goodness the invite which is basically designed by all our other friends who are also gagging for a child (or about to have one themselves) has just made me want to cancel. Make a cake if you like? Here are some ideas for gifts to help the new mum to be, send us photos of you as a baby for games and be ready to play lots of games and have a fabulous time! Puke. I want to be supportive, I really do but where does it stop? She wants at least 2 kids, what about the birthdays? Surely it’s fair to leave people who don’t want kids out of it, we don’t want to be there (have nothing to add about parenthood) and you surely don’t want people who don’t get it there..! Such an expectation no matter what your choices - you don’t see me throwing a dog shower.

Is it fair to send a gift and our love and an excuse not to attend? We want to be supportive but I feel like we are in many other ways, we will show our faces (late arrival and early exit) for future birthdays but dear God a baby shower shows like my idea of hell. So self indulgent. Advice?

A little shout out to my mom,"My mother and I don’t always get along, and never really have. We have our issues stemming from different opinions, beliefs, etc. She knows exactly what buttons to push or what to say/how to phrase something so that it worms it’s way under my skin and festers, and I do too.

That being said, my sister and I are both CF. And adamant about it. And my mother, for all that we don’t see eye to eye, completely respects and supports the both of us in our decision knowing this means she will have zero grandchildren. We’re able to crack jokes about it, have frank discussions about it and she genuinely accepts it. Ever since we both told her, she has never pushed or dropped any lines like “who will take care of you?” “You’ll regret it!” “You’ll change your mind when you meet the right person.” And for that, I can’t thank her enough. I never expected her to be ok with it and she pulled through in the most amazing way. I didn’t realize I wanted her support or approval so badly until I had it.

Hell, it’s to the point now that when we’re all three out somewhere and a kid is causing a scene, we all share a knowing look with each other. We may not share a lot, but we have this and it’s honestly more than enough.",childfree
"Thanks, Sis!","I think my big sister inadvertently confirmed my CF status years ago by getting me to babysit 2/3 of her young kids one day.

This was many years ago but I was just thinking about it when another OP mentioned not knowing how to look after kids or ever interacting with them. 

Basically she lives in another state, she has 3 kids all two years apart, I think when I was visiting I was maybe 16 or so, and she had to take the middle kid to a doctors appointment so she asked to watch the other two. One was about 2 and the other 6 or 7 at this point. 

Basically what happened was the youngest pooped and I had to change his nappy, and it was the most rank thing ever (like I almost threw up from the smell). Then not 20mins later he pooped again so I had to change it again, in the meantime older kid had been having severe constipation so she had to go but couldn’t and then she started crying for her mum and was trying to help but I was freaking out and pretty much by the time sis got home I had confirmed I would never look after kids again. 

Honestly she’s actually done a damn good job with them they’re all teenagers now and really awesome, but I’ll never forget the trauma of babysitting just the two for a few hours and realizing she does this every day for years. Gross, but thanks Sis!",childfree

PSA you don't owe your parents grandchildren.,"In fact you don't owe children to anyone. 

People with uteruses shouldn't have the choice of being sterilized taken away from them by doctors because they think that they'll regret it later on.

Your inherent worth should not be decided if you want and can have children or not. Besides it's not like being sterilized is the end of ever being a parent. Adoption or fostering is almost always an option.

I'm just so frustrated. If you want a baby to dote on just get a dog or something instead of pressuring me into something I have not wanted for my entire life. I personally am not going to painfully squeeze a horrible, crying, screaming, ugly little thing out of my vagina just to make someone else happy.

Train Platform Bingo,"Short Bingo Incident.

Was waiting on a platform with some people I know, watching these 3 kids (between 9-12yo maybe) near us restlessly and noisily run around, knock each other over, and at one point freak out over the train being ""cancelled"" bc they were reading the sign on the wrong side (effectively giving us all a jump scare). I made an offhand childfree comment to one of the ladies I was with (closer to my age, who's reactions made me think she thought similarly), and of course was met with a ""yeah, but it's different when it's your own, having a family is important"" etc.

Looking back at the 3 kids, their two moms sitting on the bench looking absolutely exhausted and done, was not exactly supporting that argument.

I later transferred onto a busy train and had the pleasure of two young girls stand at exactly head-height (I was sitting) next to me and scream excitedly for 2 hours while their dad entertained them. I've been suffering back pain and felt no guilt keeping my seat despite one girl complaining of nowehere to sit.

Mother pushing children on me after hearing her friends daughter is in hospital still after traumatic birth,"So basically I work in the same place as my mum for part time work, I'm 20 years old and I overheard my mum talking to the cleaner because the cleaner was showing her pictures of her daughters new baby.

She had gone home after this only to be rushed back to due complications. The cleaner didn't seem to care that much, in fact, she talked about it and then went right back to saying how it didn't matter because the baby was fine. 

My mum then went on to say that she wished I would hurry up and have a baby (straight after hearing how the cleaners daughter was in a mess!) and she knows I'm planning on a childfree life, I am completely not a fence sitter and It wound me up like crazy hearing how she wants me to hurry up and have a baby when I haven't even finished univeristy yet/have barely any savings and just from the point of how disrespectful it is to my feelings!",childfree

"Questions regarding ""the snip""...","(the bullet points are the tl;dr) I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that on paper, I 100% want a vasectomy, but I don't know what that all entails and am terrified of the mere thought of someone slicing up my nutsack. So, for the betterment of all mankind, I ask a few questions:



- Does it hurt? How much? 


What I've heard is it feels about as painful as getting a fairly gnarly shot (like tetnis or blood samples), and then achy balls for a few days. How achy are we talking about here? I've had steriod shots before that they said would ache a little for a few days, and I was legit bedridden for 2 days because of the pain. I'd consider myself to have a high pain tolerance (many tattoos and injuries to back that up) 



- Is it reversible? 

I'm in my mid 20s, and while I'm fairly certain I don't want kids, I've only lived half the life I will have lived when I'm 50 and people change, I was a completely different person just 5 years ago, so what if I want kids then? Too late? Totally reversible? Can I just freeze some cum and it'll be good and ready when I'm older if me and my partner decide we want it? Adoption wouldn't be any worse I suppose.




- What exactly are they going to do to me?

I've heard there are a few different methods. What are the pros/cons of each? Something about a metal clamp vs a laser I think are the two main methods?


- Will I jizz the same amount?


Not really a deciding factor, but something I'm sure everyone considering it thinks about. Will it be the same? I have this idea in my head that I'll produce far less ejaculate and maybe it'll look more watered down or something because of the snip. Is that just something I made up in my head? I don't really care, but it's definitely an unknown part of the process.



- How does the snip effect orgasms?


Will it hurt or something when I cum? Will it be less intense? 



- How does the snip effect sex-drive, testosterone, etc.?



I don't want to Lord Varys myself into a sexless dandy lad. I want to be the same muscle-bound sex-crazed maniac I've been since I was 15. Will it effect any of the different testosterone types? Will it effect sex drive? Emotions? Energy?






I believe that covers most of my concerns that can't really be found on your standard webMD type website, would love to hear your answers CF.

Still, I can’t help but see these people as inferior and seriously pity them and even berate them in my mind and question their intelligence.  

I believe that life has no inherent meaning and you have to apply meaning to you own life just to distract yourself and cope through this hell that they call earth and humanity.  That being said, I can’t find how voluntarily taking on the life long responsibility of a kid (even worse MULTIPLE kids!) is actually PREFERABLE to most people!  It blows my mind.

"""you don't want to go down that road.""","Sorry for formatting, on mobile and drunk a bit. Me (27f) and husband (37m)  were drinking wine and discussing the world.

He thought it over a few months and said he did not want to divorce me and was ok without kids. 

It's 8years now, and while drinking I mentioned the awfulness of this and that of kids, ECT and the title came up. I was very confused, as I thought he made his decision but it seems like there is regret there. I'm not sure what to do here, I told him that if he has ANY regrets or feels like he needs a child that he needs to leave but he said no, he's made his decision. he made his decision sure but now I'm worried he will grow to resent me for not giving birth for him.

"All of It Gets Old Really Fast, Huh?","I suppose I'm a borderline ""fence-sitter"". I don't hate kids, but I do feel very uncomfortable around them and it has never been in my plans to become a mother. I've always said that, in the off-chance that I'll change my mind, I'll be adopting teenagers as they are far less likely to be adopted as they get older and deserve a chance of having a family.

In the meantime, I'm left to put up with the complete dismissal of my thoughts and opinions on a child-free life. I'm currently working in hospital catering (delivering meals to patients, washing, etc) and the majority of my coworkers are easily 15+ years older than me (I'm 23), so all of that ""Oh, how do you know you don't want kids if you've never had one?"" bullcrap is par for the course.

Oh, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right. Let me just run down to the supermarket and get one of those trial babies that have a 30-day return policy if I don't like motherhood, shall I? How is it selfish of me to not want to bring a child into the world that would have a rotten childhood because I can't find it in myself to love and care for it as much it deserves to be?

Luckily, my parents accepted a long time ago that grandchildren were only going to come from my brother, who is great with kids. I'm looking forward to being a decent aunt when the time comes. Dad did once give me the ""it's selfish"" spiel, but I quickly opened his eyes to my perspective. He's not a bad person, just very stuck in his generation's mindset sometimes and accepted that I felt differently. I think Mum is quietly disappointed, but again, she'll get grand kids from my brother so it's not like she's gonna miss out on anything.

So they're okay, but I'm not looking forward to the Christmas family reunion where I'll once again have to put up with the interrogations as to why I still haven't found a boyfriend or when I'm going to produce new members of the family.....",childfree

"Pet Allergeris, Yet Another Reason to Not Have Children","I know we all have so many reasons to not have children but does anyone else include possible allergies on their list?

Manager: ""Why are you getting rid of your dog?""

Coworker: ""I think the new baby is allergic."" 

Me without thinking: ""Get rid of the kid instead."" 

My manager thought it was hilarious and agreed with me, the coworker didnt seem as amused and didnt acknowledge it hahaha.

How did your relationships with your friends change when they had kids?,"Hello, you lovely people! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here, so this is my obligatory ""sorry if I mess this post up; I haven't quite grasped how to Reddit just yet"" message. 

My best friend is getting married soon, and not being childfree like myself, her and her fiance have already started talking about kids (i.e. how many they want, when they will have them, what they will name them, etc.). I'm incredibly happy for them⁠, specifically how happy they make each other, but as selfish as this probably sounds, I can't seem to get rid of this angst that our relationship is going to change completely when they do have kids. 

I don't know if it's because I've seen one too many posts discussing how having kids ""destroyed"" friendships (or at least made them one-sided) because the new parents no longer have time for much else beyond their children, but I'm genuinely concerned that once my best friend has kids, she'll fall off the face of the Earth (or our relationship will become me visiting her at her house just to listen to her talk about her kids and nothing else).

I find my friend more irritating now that she’s pregnant.,"A friend of mine has always been baby crazy, ever since college. She (27F) with a POS guy (24M) now who manipulates her and takes all of her (teacher) money to cover money that he supposedly owes his dad, while never doing anything nice for her. She bends over backwards for a guy who told her she was not attractive and influenced her to get a gastric sleeve, and now he got her pregnant. He barely works and they live in another friend’s house.

It’s just so irritating. She has 2 degrees to pay off, an income that can barely support herself and her bills, and a guy who treats her like crap and takes her money. Like really? Why have a kid with him?

Why not focus on the career you’ve been building with those two degrees you need to pay off?

Her announcement photo was her in a shirt at Disney that says “I’ve got a rumbly in my tummy” standing next to Pooh and Tigger. Like...ugh. The stereotypes and cheesy “I can’t wait to be a mom” posts are killing me. What about the rest of her life? What about the anxiety and depression she won’t treat?

A family visit and personal reminder to myself,"So a family member was visiting us from out of state, my cousin I (F20) think. Basically my mom is her aunt, so in a sense I'm her cousin. Keep in mind my family has the youngest kids because my parents delayed having us. Anyways this leads to my niece who for the longest time I thought was my cousin since we were so close in age. I dont why she went forward with this, but she has a kid at 20. 

Why?

At 20, I joke that I'm a baby, I don't know why she decided to go through it, whether family pressure, cultural brainwashing, but she doesn't really take care of her own kid and as a result my real cousin ends up babysitting the kid and while sure it can be an alright human being, I just can't see the appeal in a mini human. 

Keep in mind, this mini human was grabbing at anything and everything including the knobs on the stove until my niece saw me stop his hands. I'm not so sure if it was because she didn't want me to touch him, make him cry or what else. Plus aside from that, there were at least 5 other kids in a 4 person mobile home with 3 other adults. 

So yeah another good reminder to never do that, especially if that mini human will know they are unwanted. And to throw away your life so easily and early? Screw that. That being said, to my cousin no I do not want to visit you back in Nevada, I'm broke and just because you are and yet you still came out to universal studios in California with so many kids doesn't mean ""why shouldn't I do that too?"" It means I have priorities and realistic expectations.",childfree
I don’t know where else to go. I’m pissed off at my mom.,"My brother is 10 years younger than me, and I’m 17F as of now. Ever since he was a baby I’ve had to babysit him because mom went back to college and had homework every night. I’d have to turn off my cartoons and go sit downstairs with him. For years she’s gotten free babysitting out of me, simply because I believed it was my job. So much time wasted because I had to watch him. I’ve grown to resent him because he has ADHD, is addicted to YouTube and Netflix, and never. Shuts. Up. He’s always talking and babbling and making mouth noises and I feel like soon I’m going to lose it. I can’t stand all that noise. More recently after I discovered this sub I told my mom I’m not watching my brother anymore and she threatened to punish me since I’m “punishing her” by not letting her frolick off to her boyfriend, leaving my brother with me. Now she set a compromise I didn’t even agree with where she puts him to bed before leaving but it still pisses me off. He could wake up at any time and then I’d be forced to watch him since mom doesn’t answer the phone when she’s with her boyfriend. I feel trapped, hating my brother and I don’t know what to do.

Edit: a couple times over the years she’s tried to offer money for longer babysitting times, but I always refused since I felt like it was my obligation and if I accepted I’d be stealing money from her and I’m so mad at myself.",childfree

Not really. But that's not my circus, not my monkeys. They're the same age as me, early 20's, but they're already settled down.

"""But you don't have kids!""","Damn right I don't

Anyway, on my team in work of 10 people I'm the only one who doesn't have any children. It's not a problem with 8 of the other 9 people I work with, but the other is a single mother (SM)  who thinks she deserves everything and all the time off in the world to take care of her kid. 

Whenever any projects we do come up, she puts herself in the job that takes the least amount of time and never bothers to help anyone else out. 

So, a few weeks ago people were talking about Christmas and what days we're working (everyday except Christmas day). 

Back in May I booked a holiday for myself and my wife as an anniversary gift and we're leaving on the 21st December until 30th. I organised my time off with work and all is good with them as I was first in.

So during this conversation, SM declares she needs to book time off for Christmas. But somebody mentions that only 2 can take Christmas off, 1 was a woman who has 3 young kids who booked it just after me and me obviously. When she heard this she went to our boss to say I should not be allowed to take leave at Christmas because I don't have kids. I shit you not. 

A couple of days go by and I was asked in to a meeting with the boss of the boss who SM is friendly with to find out if I'd be willing to take my leave another time and let SM have it instead. (He didn't know I had a holiday booked). I said in no uncertain terms that would not be happening and why should I. 

Boss said something along the lines of family friendly and I almost lost my shit. So my wife is not my family?
I'm not allowed to spend time with my family at Christmas because I didn't conceive them?

So after leaving that meeting, it has now transpired that they are trying to make special circumstances for her to have Christmas off which will leave our team short over Christmas (we're busy over Christmas).

Why don’t people hash it out BEFORE marriage?!,"  

I recently saw two separate friends who are newly married (within the last few months). 

The first one was always staunchly childfree for financial and environmental reasons. But now, AFTER being married, she admitted that he wants children and they are thinking about whether or not to go through with it. She didn’t seem into the idea but apparently, they are going to figure out this question. They are both physicians (with the level of student debt and pressure that comes with the job) who love to travel internationally.

The other one hasn’t really made it clear where she stands except that her whole life tends to be childfree: fitness is her lifestyle, extensive traveling, high level job, even a dog is too much responsibility. Her husband would like to start having kids asap but she is currently pushing that further down the road because she is not ready to settle down. They are also early thirties.

They are both strong women in their thirties and I can’t believe how irrational they are being about this. I’m worried about the future for them, whether they give into the pressure or their husband grow resentful.",childfree

Childfree and Pets,"Whenever a group is considered different from the norm there is always something said to try and bring them down or make them seem like hypocrites or bad people. I've seen it for older gamers, people who are not into getting married and people who are childfree.

What I have seen is people trying to make it sound like anyone who is childfree replaces all the possible negative effects of having a kid and how some parents act with their pets. Now we know it is not the same at all, but they try to find a case of someone with a pet that on the surface talks or acts like an obnoxious parent.

My question is, has anyone else run into this? How do you counter these people and finally, what about those who have no pets and don't like them. Do you ever feel separated from CF'ers who do?",childfree

I just read a story about this CF couple and their friends and it just crossed my mind... What if there is a place where people could try how being a parent is for a couple of weeks or something like that. 
But Ohhhcrap isn't that a bit rough with the kids? Well what if we do it at orphanages. They'd be receiving help and the chances of making a rational decision and not an emotional one seem higher to me. 
The people who decide to do it will be in charge of a set amount of children but it's not within their power. For example, I sign up for the mock parenting (that's how I'm calling it) but there is a chance I have to take care of 2 babies instead of one.

Big Strollers and Busy Bus routes.,"For context, I am a teenager. I attend an SHSM Highschool, which is a little ways away from me and busing through the school is hard at my grade level. So I have to take 2 city busses to my school, one West and then I transfer onto one going North.

Now, theres an important issue with these busses: both of them are **school routes.** Which means both of them are ALWAYS filled right to the front with highschool kids and of course the few adults. These bus routes together cover a total of 5 or 6 schools, mine having the largest volume of kids. The North bus has an overflow bus (second bus that follows a few minutes along) but that gets a little busy too.

Everything is smooth going until we get to a stop and everyone sees it. Its dreaded. Theres a large groan. The bus lowers, and we watch in horror as a mom with those **stupid chunky strollers** gets on the bus. Most of the time, they have a baby, and maybe an older kid. And I'm okay with this, they need to get places too - but they're so **entitled**.

I've had parents push through crowds of kids with their strollers, sit down at the priority seating, and leave their stroller in the aisle. You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to block peoples access to the door with the stroller, you have to put the seats up and stand. It's a safety hazard. And oh my /god/, the amount of times I've had bitchy moms ask me to move out of the priority seating because ""I'm just a lazy disrespectful teenager"" is hilarious. Because I'm absolutely able to be there, I just have an invisible disability.

These moms always get on the bus with their chunky, oversized strollers, block everyone from getting in and out easily, and never pay attention to their damn kids. I dont want to hear your baby crying or you yelling into your phone. Every kid here is quiet but you. And they get so mad when people are annoyed. I've had a parent with their little kid literally come through yelling ""MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!"" just to get to a seat at the back. It's ridiculous. 

I feel like on busses like this parents with big ass strollers shouldnt be allowed on. For the safety of their kid, the safety of us, and the convenience of everyone. Of course theres good parents, I've seen people just say ""I'll wait"" on the way home because they have a stroller, but dont bitch at teenagers on a full bus for being annoyed at you because your ugly little kid is taking up all the aisle space... put up the seats like you're supposed to.

Not really sure if this fits, but if it doesnt that's okay. I've also been binged a few times unprompted coming home late in the day. Parents are fucking weird.",childfree
My boyfriends business partner told my boyfriend he doesn’t deserve a raise because he doesn’t have children.,"This actually happened a few days ago but I’m still seething about it even days later. I feel like this is a good place to vent.  
My boyfriend works for his dad’s small business and has for about 4 years now. He does a lot of different things at his job, but I think a good umbrella term to describe his role is salesman. He has brought a LOT of money into this business over the past few years. He’s great at what he does. However, he still makes far less than anyone else there, even after being there for 4 years. His business partner, (his brother in law/his sisters husband) has been there just a few years longer than my boyfriend. But, he makes over $1000 dollars more a month than my boyfriend does. My boyfriend mentioned in passing that he feels like it’s time for a raise to his brother in law. We bought a house a year ago and between the mortgage and the repairs, he struggles with money from time to time. It’s life. But when he tried to discuss the raise with his brother in law, BIL immediately got defensive. Asking him why he’s struggling with money so much if he doesn’t have kids. My boyfriend explained that not only do we still have expenses, he also makes over 1000 dollars less than he does because he’s received raises since he’s been there. BIL says something to the effect of “well. I get that money because I have a kid. You don’t have one so I don’t see why you would get that extra money.” My boyfriend responds with something along the lines of “Your own choices in life don’t dictate whether or not I get a raise.”  He then walked away from the conversation and that was the end of it.  
I’m still so mad about it. My boyfriend works so hard at his job. He’s the first to arrive and the last to leave, and makes a ton of money for the company. Not only that, he takes on ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of last minute business trips, which happen a handful of times a month. And you know why he can do that? BECAUSE HE DOESN’T HAVE ANY FUCKING KIDS.

Clump of cells &gt; brain tumor.,"!!! Trigger warning: Talks of miscarriage ahead. Also mention of bulimia. !!!

TLDR: People are seemingly nicer to me now that I've had a miscarriage, than when I was actually sick.

Throwaway account. This will be a slight rant about my miscarriage, so trigger warning although I won't be going into much gory details. I'm labeling it personal though, because it really truly is personal. This will also be long and maybe even quite scatterbrained, no pun intended. Let's start the word avalanche:

Everyone keeps expecting me to crack, guys. I had a miscarriage last month but I'm completely over it. Everyone keeps expecting me to become angry or whatever, and I get it. A lot of people would count a miscarriage as a huge loss, even when they didn't know they were pregnant. Which was me. I have PCOS and have been told that getting pregnant would be pretty damn difficult. My husband, who is also childfree and is currently now losing weight for a better vasectomy recovery, and I have been careful for years. But difficult doesn't mean impossible after all. Even if I wanted children, I would adopt in the first place because with the difficulty of getting pregnant, there's also a higher chance of a miscarriage and I would never want to put myself through the constant heartbreak some of my acquaintances have been through. 

All that being said, I didn't know I was pregnant because of my sporadic cycle. I didn't know I was pregnant because I'm a recovering bulimic and feel sick often. I didn't think twice about it. And until now, writing this, I still don't think about it. As a loss or anything. And if I'm angry, it's because of this...

When I was 27, 31 now, I was settled in my career as a third grade teacher, I was engaged to my husband, we moved into a fantastic fixer-upper (that we're still updating), and things were so great.  Until it all came to a halt. I started to get headaches everyday, which wasn't that unheard of because of my ever changing hormones. But these were something else. I would feel nauseous, disoriented, and in a two week period, I went from bad to worse. Forget about the headaches, I started to forget things. Not just appointments and stuff on my calendar. I'm talking about the words for things like ""water"" and ""rug."" I started slurring my words as I taught my kids. I knew something was wrong when I was driving and almost caused a wreck just because I forgot and didn't look in my blindspot. I went to about 3 doctors and finally one suggested I got an MRI. And so I did. Within a few days or maybe a week, I can't remember, I got the news. I had a big, fat, spot ""the size of a prune"" sitting in/on my brain. My mind blanks out about what happened in what I call ""the between time."" But it wasn't cancer. I had my surgery and I was once again, (PCOS and former bulimia aside), the perfect example of health. I had to learn a lot over again because the brain surgery left me with some memory problems, as well as issues with my motor skills. I'm almost 100% now. I struggle daily with certain things, but I'm very blessed; a lot of people don't recover as fast as I have. If at all.

So why did I tell you that? Because people, most of which know that children of my own aren't in my plans, treated me more kindly and more sympathetic NOW because I've lost a clump of cells (I was 10 weeks invaded, btw) than when I was learning how to write my fucking name again. My own mother would get frustrated at me during flashcards instead of being patient back then, and now calls me up on her lunch hour almost every single day since I've had the miscarriage to check on me. My mother-in-law is forever telling me that we could always try again, because she too has PCOS and tried for three years to have my husband. She was there when I was going through the brain stuff, and wasn't nearly as attentive then from what I can remember. Everyone keeps telling me that I will find another job like it's easy to just leave the teaching career path for years, then enter back in (I have a different job now, teaching was very overwhelming after I had to relearn a fuck ton) after I've worked my ass off getting to where I was. Yet, those same people who scoff at me complaining about my work situation, are rubbing my back when we pass by baby clothes at Target. I do not want children. I like to work with them, but that is where it ends. All I want to do is send out a mass text saying, ""Please stop bringing up my miscarriage and trying for another baby sometime. If I knew I was pregnant, I would have aborted it."" 

I feel like an asshole sometimes because I just want to tell everyone to shut up about it and leave my husband and me alone. I know that they're just being nice, but it's annoying. They all knew we didn't want a child ever. Anyways, if you made it this far, you're awesome and I hope your day/night is fantastic. Thanks for reading my story/rant.",childfree
Neighbors kiddos came over today and it was genuinely.. okay.,"Background: So i‘m(F24) CF and i‘ve never liked to be around children for too long but for some reason kids really love me. 

Today i was working in the garden (suburbs) with my cat (the closest thing to a baby i‘ll ever have). His name is Spooky and he’s a wonderfully polite cat, digging when i‘m digging, chasing after discarded weeds, just a delight. 

Anyway, across the street there’s a big tree and some kids were running around there yelling and making me consider putting on headphones until i overhear that they need a ladder cause a kid can’t come down. 

I’m not an asshole so i go up to the 3 kids (all brothers from age 6-8) and ask them if i should bring a ladder, they say yes please so i do (followed by Spooky meowing concernedly at me handling a huge ladder). They instantly love the cat and want to help me garden so for the next two hours i taught them how to gently approach my very patient feline friend and give them all some garden tool to play with. They help with watering too, soaking me with water. Oh well. 
The whole time they were asking questions and talking non stop and i genuinely listened and tried to teach them a thing or two about cats and tulips. 

So after spending some rather okay time with kids i‘m feeling reassured that i do not want any but i could absolutely hang out with a niece/nephew if there ever was one.",childfree
Costco Birth Control,"I have been childfree for a long time, but I also love Costco - which puts me in a conundrum, because Costco might as well be breeder central. But, for the food court, samples and the toilet paper, I am willing to brave the gauntlet.

While browsing jackets, a lady with 3 kids (2 in the cart, 1 walking beside the cart) stops next to me to lecture her kid for misbehaving.

Big surprise, he doesn't. So she resorts to threats, and the one that sticks out to me is ""If you don't stop right now, I am going to punch you.""

The thing that bothers me the most, is that I'm sure she would turn around and tell me how happy her kids make her, and how they make life worth living, and why haven't I popped out one of these bundles of joy that I will eventually want to punch in the face yet.",childfree
Marriage started out great,"So before we even discussed marriage my wife and I had a very important conversation. I told her I didn’t want to have children. My thought here was if I tell her my intentions she can save herself time and leave the relationship to be with someone that wants kids. She told me she didn’t want kids either, mind you we are relatively young. so 4 years later she brings it up, she says she wants to have children would I change my mind. My answer is still no. My worry is that our relationship, our marriage is going to fall apart. I don’t know what I would do if that were to happen. If anyone has been in this situation please reach out to me. I’m going mad right now",childfree
Could in-laws ever have the power to change a spouse’s stance on being CF?,"I am a worry wart when things get into my head. My husband and I are in our mid 30’s. His mom is awesome. She did get a little at us in one convo about us not having kids a few years ago but she never bothered us again and is one of the kindest women I know. I think the concept was just very different for her and unexpected. But my husband’s step mom is another story. I honestly don’t remember his dad ever piping up. Anyway, sMIL always is making comments to us “when you have kids, when you have more mouths to feed, when I’m old and grey I hope I’ll have grand children!” and asking us why we won’t so many times!!!! 

My husband actually answers her and says he has no idea how he could manage with all he wants to accomplish in his life. My reasoning is I have never wanted to take care of children or even adult children, and I explained this once and beyond that I just remind her “we aren’t having kids”. Then beyond that I let him handle it. I can hardly decide if I ever want a cat! Nevermind a child. 

But sMIL’s constant comments, even when corrected, make me nervous. Like is she trying to break him/me? Can anyone even do that with a decision like this? I don’t see my husband being manipulated or changing his mind but my mind knows how to imagine things vividly. I never told her it’s none of her business but my husband said that is fine for me to say to her and go ahead, but he will say his reasoning why because that’s what he thinks is right. It just freaks me out. Why are people like this woman? Why do they do this to people? Just the bringing it up all the time makes me think of manipulation/brainwashing. Thanks for listening.",childfree
Kids are not fun,"Why in the hell people keep spreading children videos as funny videos? Kids are not fun, they are just a mess. I’m tired of unfollowing and unsubscribing all the time because I don’t wanna be massive spammed with infant nonsense. I would like to have a safe haven with funny videos of only things that matter. The saddest part is that in order to be “funny” kids must be injuried or in danger or screaming its lungs out for no reason, I wish people were more sensitive about this kind of exposure, it’s like parents don’t even care.",childfree

First, thank you for such great community!  
I have a question. I hope someone can point me to the right direction.

I found that fascinating and interesting.

Felt bad for couple who brought a baby on date,"Last night I went on a date at a small korean resturant. There was a different couple with a baby in a stroller there and i thought ""oh great it's probably going to scream and whine"". But actually the baby only made small babbling noises and didn't scream, but then i noticed it was because the other couple was taking care of it the whole time, i felt kind of bad they didn't really get any time to themselves while they were there, and was so happy i could just relax and enjoy food with my date.",childfree
I could never be a parent,"I’m honestly too selfish and theres things I want to do. But when you’re a parent your needs and wants come second to your kid. That’s just depressing to me, I couldn’t deal with that. 

I know it’s selfish but fuck it. I don’t want to give up my life for someone else’s, other than my partner if I have one. But even then that’s different. A relationship is a compromise but raising a kid is just complete surrender to this other being you’re responsible for. It’s too overwhelming. The thought of that being my future enrages and scares me. I want to live for me and not someone else. I can’t see myself giving up everything and having myself take a backseat to a child that may not even like me or be a good person. I don’t understand it and I feel like I’m missing a component of being a person when I hear people talk about parenthood. How it’s a great sacrifice and they wouldn’t change it for the world.

The movie Game Night is basically Lifescript™ propaganda [Discussion],"So I recently rewatched the movie Game Night and at the end I realized it was basically how getting married and having kids is the best thing ever.  &gt;!So a man and a woman meet and bond over their incredibly competitive natures and end up getting married. Then they decide to have a kid, but it's not going so well so they go see a fertility doctor who tells them that it's most likely a psychological response. And it turns out he has an inferiority complex about his older brother who is single, lives in a mansion, travels around the world for work, has younger bros dream car, and dazzles all their friends. So instead of dealing with his issues with therapy or something they decide that if they beat older bro at a game his issues will be magically solved and the baby making can begin. During the game the man has doubts because one of their married friends had kids and now they never see them and their lives don't seem all that great. But she convinces then that having a baby will be great because they're such extra special period that they'll produce they world's best baby. Later it's revealed that the older bro is actually criminal and is insane jealous of younger bro for getting married and having a normal life. So At the end they get pregnant and even the serial dater of the group decides to settle down and get a steady gf.!&lt;",childfree
"One ejaculation, four lives changed forever: My childfree friends decided to have a baby.","Long and depressing content ahead.

The cast: 

Morgan &amp; I (Iris) - lesbian couple, 28/F, together 4 years. CF. 

Kate &amp; Nick - M/F married, 29, together 8 years. Formerly CF, now struggling parents to a 10 month old.

Morgan met Kate at work about 3 years ago, and they instantly hit it off. We all began hanging out together. We were both DINK couples with high paying jobs and no debt. We were also all marathon runners except Nick, who picked it up after a while. So we spent our free time running together, drinking at new craft beer spots, attending concerts, catching flights and taking road trips, wine and paint nights, trivia nights at our favorite bar, and so on.

To hear Kate talk just over a year ago, you’d have thought she was 100% CF. She frequented this sub. She bitched about entitled mombies, would talk about her 2 abortions to anyone who would listen, and openly loathed the idea of childrearing. She became visibly disgusted when hearing about or discussing pregnancy and birth. We never explicitly asked Kate &amp; Nick if they were CF or had “the talk” because of all of that.

Then, all of the fucking sudden, Kate was just 4 months pregnant and keeping it.

I don’t have words to describe my shock at the time, or in the months that followed. Kate had an extremely difficult pregnancy. She was ill and bedridden nearly the entire time - preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, the whole 9. She had to quit her job the very month after announcing the pregnancy because she was just too fucking ill to work.

She had a life threatening complication and went into labor at ~27 weeks, about 3 months early. She tore from her V to her A and nearly died from other issues. The kid (Charlie) was a super preemie and came out sickly as fuck. He was on life support for the first 3 months. Despite having health insurance, this financially devastated Kate &amp; Nick. They’re now living paycheck to paycheck with almost nothing in savings.

We’re currently separated by that incident by about 7 months. Charlie is fine and healthy. Life is objectively normal again. Kate’s job even took her back. But she and Nick are completely different people.

You read what I wrote about Kate’s horrific experience. Just yesterday she made a “vajasshole” joke and talked about how she pisses herself every time she sneezes. Somehow despite all of this, she’s begun to bingo Morgan and I. She even went so far as to suggest that we get inseminated at the same time, because wouldn’t it be “so cute??? They’d be like twins!” Fucking revolting.

Their once-cherished dog is suffering. They have a German shepherd that was going to doggy daycare while they worked. They can’t afford it anymore because they’re spending $1800/mo on fucking BABY MONTESSORI DAYCARE. The dog began shitting all over the house and tearing things up, because OF COURSE THE POOR THING DID, and is now crated for 8+ hours a day while they’re at work.

Despite Morgan and I being there for them through it all, we are essentially yesterday’s news. They’ve cancelled on every plan we’ve tried to make, aside from us going to their home. Before Kate found out she was pregnant, we came up on an INSANELY cheap Alaska travel package, and we all bought in. The trip is in December, and they’re canceling. It’s non-refundable. They have the option to leave Charlie with his grandparents, but Kate “has to keep pumping” and “they can’t afford to miss work.” 🙃 It’s a 5 day trip, already paid for, and Nick has PTO. Kate isn’t working, and do you want to know why? Because she won’t let go of her “crunchy mom” bullshit. Charlie clearly has fucking pink eye right now, and Kate’s just been squirting tit juice on it instead of taking him to the doctor. Surprise, the $1800 BABY MONTESSORI DAYCARE won’t take him back until the pink eye clears up. 

We asked if her and Nick could drop by our place (1 mile away) and take care of our cat while we’re on the trip. All she needs is some attention and her litter box scooped. Just eyeball the kitty water cooler and feeder - both are automatic. They said no, because “Charlie.” 

Kate acts like we’re the problem when we tell her to stop bingoing us - we use the very word itself and she KNOWS what we mean. She keeps saying “I’m not bingoing you, you’re just being assholes and refusing to see another point of view.” I SEE her point of view, and it’s fucking awful. She’s gained 50 lbs and lost everything to Charlie. I won’t sit here and call him a crotch goblin or a parasite because it’s not his fault - it’s his stupid fucking parents’. She can’t run with us anymore because of her poorly healing vajasshole. Can’t drink, can’t travel, has to milk herself like a cow every 2-4 hours. Barely sleeps. And for what? Financial ruin and a total loss of freedom? 

We’re currently not speaking because of all of this. Morgan and Kate got into a blowout fight after Kate text her a picture of a mom breastfeeding 2 babies at once with “you &amp; Iris 😌” as the caption. Fuck that. I’m incredibly hurt and upset to have lost Kate and Nick like this, but the experience has been the best birth control I could have asked for. 

TL;DR: A dude blew a load in his wife and we lost our friends. Thanks for listening.",childfree
Visiting my in-laws....,"So this past weekend my fiancé and I went to spend some time with his parents. Now we have made it perfectly clear we don’t want children, maybe ever, and we both felt this way long before we met each other. Now my parents know how we feel and I don’t actually know how they feel about it because they don’t insert their opinion into something like this that is our personal choice. Now, back to my fiancé’s parents... ever since we have been together his mother has been adamant that we give them grand children. And every time it comes up as politely as I can I say “no thanks, that’s not for us”. This most recent visit was the worst, here are some of her bargaining chips:
1. We would have such cute kids! Maybe. But I’m not taking on the responsibility of raising a child (that I don’t want) for the next 18 years in the hopes that they are cute....
2. We don’t have to decide right now! You have time! (We are both 26) But just in case she told me to freeze some of my eggs so I don’t wait too long and miss my opportunity. LOL I didn’t say this, but little does she know my fiancé and I have had discussions and I’m planning to have my tubes tied in the next few years. 
3. We don’t even have to take care of a baby! She will take care of it! Ummmm. No. One of the reasons I am against have children is because the thought of carrying and giving birth to a baby is repulsive to me. And I don’t believe in having children and pawning them off to someone else to raise. No thank you. 

That’s all I can remember at the moment but I’m sure there were more. Honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can stay polite when she goes on a baby rampage. My fiancé and I are working really hard towards our personal and professional goals, none of which involve children. We have both said that if we ever change our mind about children we would much rather adopt or foster a child than have one of our own, and when we gave this possible option to his mother she was completely against it because she wants a grandchild who is related to her. 

For the most part my MIL is a wonderful person, but damn, things like this make me rethink how involved of a relationship I want to have with her. 

Sorry if this is a bit rambly and lacks cohesiveness, but it feels really good to rant in a safe place!",childfree
I don't regret my 2 abortions. Life is soo much better without kids and pregnancy,"So I was just thinking about how I'm actually so glad that I had my abortion (back in August at 13 w 4d) then last year in July.

Thinking off the top of my head of all the immediate benifits:
No more vomiting, nausea, leaking breasts, less fatigue. Actual time for myself. More money, can go on my cruise I had booked after the abortion, not being a literal glorified slave to someone else, not having to babyproof everything, not having to move, being able to sleep in, no screaming, very quiet and peaceful, less work to do (id of been principally incharge probably), not having to waste money, not having body destroyed, being able to actually do things and have hobbies.

It can be a bit hard at first accepting what happened but there is so much immediate relief and from that point on I just realised how much better quality my life is from not keeping those pregnancies and staying child free.",childfree

So hard to find an apartment,"My SO and I are thinking about moving closer to my family when our lease is up in January. I've been looking at places online and the places within our budget either don't allow pets or only one is allowed. We have three cats and they're a package deal, I would pay any amount they wanted in pet fees to keep them. Where the hell is kid fees? They're so much more destructive than any of my cats. They hardly destroy their toys, they're all so gentle and loving and lazy. Why am I not allowed to bring them?

*""Pets are a luxury.""*

**KIDS AREN'T?** They're way more expensive than an animal. Just because you *can* have a kid doesn't mean that you *should*. 

Sally chose to have a kid, I chose to have a cat - they're both animals. So where is that pet fee for kids.

Thanksgiving and the Screeching Child,"I'm in Canada, so this past weekend was our thanksgiving long weekend. My S/O and I had a lovely time at my grandparents on Sunday night, and then the Monday evening we were at his grandmas. 

So yesterday (Monday)my S/O's sister, her boyfriend and their child (about 2M) drive down to join us at his grandmas for dinner. The kid is cute enough, I'm thinking ""this is fine, I babysit my niece and nephew and it's great"". NOT. GREAT. 

This kid is definitely old enough to be talking coherent words, yet walks with a soother in his mouth, and I don't think I heard him say anything all night. Not so bad right? WRONG. Instead of talking, he likes to SCREAM and I mean high pitched wails ALL night. The parents  reactions range from his mom saying ""No, please stop, I don't like that"" to ""Give him what he wants so he'll stop"". Did he stop? No, not once. For about four hours this kid ran around and screeched, varying from him being upset, to just doing it seemingly for fun/attention? 

I felt awful, because I was clearly visibly annoyed and his sister and her BF are nice people. I'm very sarcastic by nature, so when he screamed at the dinner table I said jokingly ""That's how you get stabbed by a fork"" which did not make for a happy look from mom haha

But seriously, am I the only one who thinks they should punish him for screaming like that? If he did it once, maybe I could understand, but all this kid did was shriek high pitched noises for five hours. I felt bad for leaving early but it's honestly not fun going to a family gathering and all the attention is on a screaming kid, we didn't have any actual conversations just watch him run around and scream",childfree

Got bingo'd... by another CF.,"Glad everyone enjoyed my story from the other day because I’m back, and apparently, I’m surrounded by these people. 

I went out for girls’ night on Sunday night (my friends and I all had Monday off for Columbus Day), and while one of my friends has a 3-year-old (and she’s a fantastic mom, not a breeder at all. VERY well-behaved little girl), the other 3 of us are CF. Mom friend totally gets it, she’s a rad gal imo. 

So, we’re at a bar, and mom friend steps aside to answer her phone because her husband called. When she stepped aside, I made a comment about how I appreciated the kind of mom she turned out to be, she doesn’t shove her kid down our throats, etc. One of my friends (let’s call her Sam) kind of huffed and disagreed, saying that mom friend isn’t the same anymore. Now, I’ll agree with Sam here, mom friend used to be different. She used to be a hardcore partier who would get so drunk, we’d have to carry her home to her abusive ex-boyfriend and probably call the cops and all this other shit. Now, she’s very responsible, intelligent, has a fantastic husband, a very well-behaved daughter, and STILL makes time to hang out with us. I’m damn proud of her. 

Sam then made a comment about her daughter being a brat and “we don’t need more kids on this earth,” and so on. I made another comment about mom friend’s daughter being cute. This seemed to set Sam off. She just kind of looked at me like I was crazy. I just said “what? I really like kids, especially ones like (mom friend’s daughter). I just don’t want any of my own, and I get why you don’t care for them.”

Now Sam was enraged (and honestly, maybe a drink or two too far in). She told me that I can’t call myself CF if I like kids, kids are awful, I’m gonna end up with kids anyway, I’m gonna change my mind and have kids, I’m immature (ha!), I’m gonna end up with like 6 kids, blah blah blah

And I swear to you all this went on even when mom friend came back to the table. We didn’t stay too much longer before Sam called an Uber home, my other friend went with her just to make sure she got home safe, and mom friend and I went window shopping for another hour before we all headed home. 

Because apparently if you’re child free, you must be a child-hating monster. That’s the rule, everyone.",childfree

Stop telling me to have children,"First I'd like to say me &amp; my wife both 28 are and have been CF for 9 years. I'm a clinical pharmacist and she's a PT. We enjoy life and going on random trips out and holidays to other European countries.
Co workers keep telling me that I should have kids soon and that I'd love my own. Fast forward to today where a Co worker has sent me a message telling me they're late for work as their kid has shat themselves and they need to clean the kid up whilst doing the school run. Here I am on my holiday from work, sitting in my dressing gown, reading some Brian Cox, watching cartoons and chilling with a nice fresh coffee &amp; my Siberian Husky. Life be good.

Paying for sterilization without insurance,"I’m 20F and on my parents’ insurance. My mom knows I don’t want kids but hopes I will change my mind. My dad doesn’t know and I want to keep it that way. When I mentioned a bisalp in passing, he got really mad about it. Our deductible is so high that we never meet it so I’m sure they pay for all my doctors appointments out of pocket. I’m just wondering how other people paid for their sterilization and if it’s possible to do it myself at such a young age.",childfree
Needing more than just a childfree advice..,"So first off, let me say that what I’m about to say will probably seem all over the place because I’m currently feeling all over the place. This is speaking from a childfree view in life, abortion and relationship problems.

I have a boyfriend, who I’m absolutely crazy about. When we first met, I told him what I always tell people (I date both genders), I’m not one for having kids. Everyone seems to accept it or not but that’s their choosing. So anyway, growing up, I was told that having kids would be difficult and I accepted that because I already knew what I wanted. I been telling my family before I was even 10 about not wanting kids. So, at 27 years old, I got pregnant. Surprisingly. You’d think I’d see this as a miracle and keep the fetus, right? Wrong. I seen it as my life being over once the test went positive and when I did the ultrasound as it was mandatory before operation, I felt nothing. My boyfriend still isn’t forgiving to this day. He tells me I’m being selfish and not considering what he wanted, but this is my body. I choose what happens. 

Now forward until now, after that happened, I’m now doing everything to make sure I won’t get pregnant again. I’ve done birth control with many failures, and now I’m in the process of tubal ligation. I finally told my boyfriend about it and he doesn’t approve. He told me that he’s not going to allow it. I simply said “this is my body, I choose what happens.”, now I feel like, when did I stop having control over what happens with my body? I’m also a victim of sexual abuse, even then I had to work on myself to have my own sense of body ownership. But I’m dealing with it again but over the fact of having kids or stopping the produce permanently. 

He told me he can’t be with me now if I actually go through with this surgical procedure. I told him he has the out. As much as I love him, where is the respect?
Who said we HAVE to have kids? Who decides this about ourselves?",childfree
Children were allowed to yell during my dads celebration of life.,"My dads celebration of life was this past Sunday evening. It took place outside around dusk as we were going to be lighting candles. The man who we got to speak at the service did a really lovely job. He read a Washington Irving poem that made me cry. He was also a good friend of my fathers so his speech was very personal and moving. 

HOWEVER

A lot of people brought small children and these kids literally. Did. Not. Stop. Yelling. There was a good hour beforehand for them to run around the small park, play, get their energy out, whatever. But when the ceremony started, none of the parents even attempted to settle them down or quiet them. I had to strain to hear my dads friend talk and he was practically shouting.

Got my consultant appointment on Thursday and I’m nervous AF,"Hey fellow childless folks

I’m 30f living in the UK who has managed to get a referral from my GP to see a consultant about sterilisation on Thursday. There is 8-13 week wait in my city so I’ve taken the soonest one which happens to be this week. 

I know already about the fabulous sterilisation binder but has any one got any tips to really convince the consultant I want my tubes tied? 

I’m worrying at the moment as my GP said ‘you clearly know what you want but it’s not me you have to convince it’s the consultant who will be doing the surgery. They are going to ask you why you don’t want the coil and you were unable to give me an answer when I said there was a 10 year non hormonal one that has a better fail rate than tying your tubes, so be prepared.’

I argued that I have very heavy periods ( 2 weeks) and the coil could make my periods heavier. I also mentioned it’s not permanent and I have weighed up my decisions but that’s not enough to convince a consultant? 

Also some background I have hashimotos so I can’t be on the pill or implant (or any hormonal choices) 

Thanks a bunch",childfree

Roommates stopped talking to me because I'm CF. House is an awkward mess right now,"First of all I wanna make it clear that I don't think that it should be a crime or something that they stopped talking to me, but I'm sure anyone that has shared a house before knows how awkward and uncomfortable it can get. I have 3 roommates, all girls, all obsessed about children. One of them is never really present so I don't have many interactions with her either way, but the 2 other girls are both always in the living room or the kitchen so anytime I go out of my room I have to see them. Both of them are absolutely mental about children, one works at a childcare and the other is studying to be a primary school teacher, so you can imagine where this is heading. 

Up until last week, we've been living for a few months together and never really had any problem and they would talk to me normally, but then it all changed. I was making dinner one day, and they were in the kitchen and talking about 'children with cancer' and were literally crying their eyes out and I was just thinking to myself 'yikes' but said nothing, and they thought it was weird I didn't cry with them or showed any emotion about it. I never said anything bad or offensive I just stay quiet when the topic is children, because thankfully they never had asked me (up to that point) if I planned on having children. 

Then a couple of days pass and they are showing baby pictures to each other on the phone, and having all that 'they're so innocent' kind of talk, and somehow the conversation we had drove to the point that one of them said:   
'I'm not saying that when adults die or get hurt isn't bad, but when it's a child it's so much worse'  


And that's the one argument I always hated hearing so stupidly I said that that's BS, because am adult is also someone's child and they basically got the idea 'OP HATES KIDS' which to be fair, is not wrong, but I also don't say that out in the open to almost anyone. So now, every time I go cook, they sit there in the kitchen and talk and ignore me, like if I'm not even there, they don't say hi or just catch up on things, or even talk to me about anything regarding chores in the house. It's so awkward I kinda hate getting out of my room even. 

TLDR: Roommates find out I don't like children, they're both crazy about children. They collectively ignore me and give me then silence treatment and I feel uncomfortable in my own house.",childfree
I don't know what to title this.,"I literally tried like three other titles, but I couldn't think of any that actually described the situation in TLDR manner.

This happened almost a year ago when I was spending time with my grandma. Now, my Dad divorced my Mom almost six years ago, which of course means my Dad got together with a woman who already had a 24 year old daughter and grandkids. 

Now my Dad's girlfriend, who I will call Janette, is a very demanding person. She will only agree with things that don't concern her grandchildren, and if anything comes up even remotely mentioning the two little crotch stains she either gets all out yelling defensive, or mocks them like they aren't in the room (which they are, most of the time).

So, we were sitting around the small outdoor table my grandmother has in front of her house talking about whatever came to mind. Of course, Janette has to bring up her grandchildren because why the fuck not it's not like nobody else cares. 

Before I go any further, I would like to mention that these grandchildren have a cacophony of issues. Both the younger and older have very bad attention issues, which prompts them to make loud noises, make scenes, and yell at people to watch whatever retarded kids show they're watching. This is mostly because their mother, Janette's daughter, lets the TV raise them instead of doing anything. 

The two also have many other problems. The eldest constantly gets himself hurt, which then leads to other medical problems since from what I've seen his body can't heal any kind of injury without medical help. He also gets sick every other week, which is a lot more than normal. The youngest on the other hand, is a very punchy little kid who'll fight with his brother over every little thing. He will then cry when he is either disciplined or things go wrong like the eldest fighting back. 

Janette says that she doesn't know what to do anymore since her grandchildren refuse to listen to any disciplinary action and change for the better. Part of this is because Janette's daughter reverses any kind of disciplinary process by letting them have whatever the fuck they want when they're with her. 

Of course, neither me or my grandma can actually bring this up because Janette will get angry. So we let her continue her little tirade, which eventually culminates in her wondering if they have something wrong with them mentally.

Of course, being the person who had ADHD and borderline Autism (I mean the real Autism not the internet insult) I know exactly why the grandkids act the way they do, because I did the same thing as a kid. Not to mention I had to sit and watch as I learned that Janette's daughter has mental illnesses like depression, ADHD and Bipolar Disorder and takes NONE OF HER MEDS. 

So I decided it was time to actually say something. I of course ask something across the lines of ""have you ever considered they have mental issues?"" Which I will admit was a very bad way to put it, but either way Janette gets angry. 

She looks at me and says that I don't know anything because she's taken her grandchildren to fifteen different doctors and they've never mentioned anything like Autism (which says a lot about the doctors in Michigan) and that if I wanted to insult her grandchildren then I could do so somewhere else.

I say that I wasn't trying to insult her second generation semen demons and go on to say that I was the same way her grandkids are when I was their age, the only problem is that they don't have the medicine they need and the discipline that they need. 

I promptly ended the conversation by leaving, which I'm sure Janette had a fit about to my grandmother. 

And now almost a year later I learn that Janette has been spewing shit along the line of ""My kids have Autism so please don't mind them"". 

I can't explain in words the extent to which this infuriates me. It was already a leap to be angry at me for bad parenting, but to turn around and start using what I said as a reason to excuse your kids for their bad behaviour?

News flash, it's not an excuse. It's an explanation. There is a huge difference between the two. It explains why your kids are energetic, but it does not exempt them from the discipline they should be receiving. So not only do you twist my words to your benefit, but you also use it as a reason to retract any kind of disciplinary effort you already had? 

I could vomit in anger right now just recalling it. 

So, moral of the story: Janette is an absolute failure of a parent, her grandchildren will grow up to be good for nothing delinquents if everything goes the way she wants it to, my grandmother will be stuck in the middle (which I am not happy about at all) and I will forever be stuck with my hatred of both Janette and her shitty grandkids. 

I apologize for my rant, I just needed to convey my anger in words and explain exactly why I should be able to beat sense into people.",childfree
Feeling left out,"So I don't know what's going on with the water around here or if they're spraying something into the air but everyone and their dog is all of a sudden having kids around me. My dance community is currently going through a baby boom and it didn't stay away from my social circle as well.

I was a part of this little training/performance group, originally consisting of six dance pairs including me and my partner. A year and a half ago we started training together and over time performed at a couple of little social events - Halloween party, Christmas party, stuff like that. It's just for fun, nothing professional. Anyway, those people eventually became my friends. I don't mean close friends, I really really don't make friends easily, but they were basically my only real social circle. We would sometimes hang out together outside of dancing, go to the movies or whatever. But then everyone got pregnant.

One of the girls was actually already pregnant in the beginning, she stopped going a few weeks after I joined, but then two girls got pregnant around the same time, one gave birth two months ago and the other one three weeks ago. Also, this new fad seems to be self-sustaining, a girl that was previously making jokes about everyone having babies told me that she and her boyfriend decided to jump the fence because at least their kid will have a lot of friends their age growing up. I get that they probably wanted to do it for other reasons but that was the deciding factor.

Newly joining the lactating squad is my friend, a girl that I became really close with, that joined to replace one of the pregnant ladies. She told me just last week that she and her husband are also expecting and now should be around three months along.

And they all seem happy with their new family situation (or at least seemed to be when I last saw them), so I'm happy for them. But I have also seen my pregnant friends just twice in the last six months, since they quit our dance group. Their partners (both in dance and in life) quit shortly after them and I only saw them a few times at a social dance before they stopped going altogether. And now I'm losing another person. My social circle has basically fallen apart. We have now decided to dissolve our dance group, the attendance has been steadily dropping (and not just for pregnancy reasons, my partner for example is currently buried in work).

And since the baby boom has been going on for a while, there's been also an increase in people bringing their kids to social events and even dance lessons and I'm so over that. In two out of three lessons I went to last week, there's been a baby making noises every five minutes, same goes for basically every social event I've recently attented. I'm dreading the moment the kids will be old enough to join the dance floor themselves. I just can't imagine it would end in any other way than kids running around unsupervised, getting into everyone's way, screeching from the top of their lungs and everyone standing around cooing how cute they are.",childfree

It scares everyone and it has come to the point where you can't blame the parenting. He is a born horrible person. He breaks everything, all we do is clean the house after him. Whenever he spends the weekend at his dads, neither my mother or I want him to get back too early, because all the cleaning has been for nothing.

Tips on consultation for tubal ligation?,"I scheduled a consultation for tubal ligation, it'll be in about a month. Over the phone, I asked how long after consultation would the procedure take place. The scheduler asked what I wanted the procedure for (I said for permanent birth control), then she kind of hesitated before saying something like 'well, insurance approval usually takes longer when you're so young like this.'. I am 27f.

I heard tubal ligation requests are usually met with a bunch of condescending questions/ comments or even outright refusal to perform the procedure, but I live in a very liberal state so figured I'd be fine. Now I'm not so sure. To make matters (maybe, don't want to assume) more complicated, the only gyno available in any reasonable amount of time is a male.

I'm wondering if anyone who'se had this procedure has come across any magic words or reasoning that finally 'clicked' for the doctors to get the procedure approved without too much flack? I just want this done asap so I don't have to deal with side effects of hormonal birth control anymore. 

Tldr of my personal reasons for not wanting children is basically: physical and mental health issues in my genes. Raised by extremely abusive parents and cannot continue cycle. Didn't get a childhood so am not willing to sign away even more of my lifetime caring for another being. Also dislike children.

Not confident any of those reasons will sound 'good enough' to the doctor/ insurance.",childfree

Children running around the gym,"Ok, so the gym I workout at is pretty good at keeping normal people (non gym rats) away, because it is a warehouse with no air conditioning and located in the deep south of the USA. It has no mirrors, no air conditioning, no bullshit, and I love it.

A few sets in, I saw the same kid, who was standing next to one of the benches, and piling a bunch of 5 pound (2.2kg) plates on the very very end of the bar, and pretending they were a steering wheel for a car. This kid put sooo many mini-plates on the tip of this bar, with someone benching right next to it, I have no idea how it didnt flip over.

I grabbed the bar once I noticed and tried to say, ""no, you can hurt someone like this"", but the grotch-goblin just went to get more plates. I finally had to yell, ""hey, does this belong to anyone? and the awkward dad I saw earlier came up and said ""oh, it's ok, I got it""

Like, dude, no you do not, your little 'oopsie' was just hanging off a 45 pound metal bar right next to someone. If that had flipped from the off balance load the clueless gym bro next to it would have been in some serious hurt.

The past six months, I don’t know what happened but SIX of my coworkers have gotten pregnant. Another two girls got engaged. So now that’s all anyone can talk about. It’s my own version of hell lol. 

Two of the pregnant girls got knocked up by guys they were hooking up with. 

The first girl got knocked up and the guy decided to stick around. Their first child is autistic and it has caused her a lot of stress. Her boyfriend (he won’t marry her) lets her work all the hours, clean, and run errands. She complains about her boyfriend and her child - and then she asks me when I’m having kids! Oh yeah, now she’s pregnant with her second kid. Like...did you not learn from your first mistake?

The second girl had been hooking up with her on and off ex and a new guy. Apparently the new guy is the dad so now they’re rushing to get married. 

I feel like a lot of women rush to get married and have children so their lives look good from the outside. They could care less about the man they’re marrying. They want to show off their engagement ring and their expensive, over the top wedding. 

The two girls I talked about will probably end up “proud” single moms at some point. It’s a shame that these women trade in their freedom because they wanted some dick. And I’m the weird one?

Totally surprising!,"My sister in law has 2 kids, one close to 2 years old and one at 3 months. She has her mom babysitting on Mondays and Tuesdays so she can work.

Healer Told Me I’m Gonna Have A Child When I Know I Want to Be Childfree,"So this was an interesting situation for me. About a few months ago my mom and I went to see a healer that I had seen previously. Lots of things she said resonated when I had a reading led by her prior to that. 

My mom had her reading. I went to support my mom. Then at the end, she says to me I feel a sadness from you. Yes, I have depression and I had been dealing with my parents terrible relationship and abuse. 

I didn’t feel like opening up. But then she proceeds to say you’re gonna have a little girl that will bring lots of healing. 

I remember feeling like “hold up” (dr Dre voice). 
So I said “I don’t want children”. Then my mom of course grabs onto that and says “you see I’ve it a chance blah blah”. It was weird and I started crying because I was frustrated and it seems like my whole life I’ve had to fight to the fact that I just don’t want children. It’s not a picture I ever had in my head. I mean I can’t make up the kids in my head. 

I’m 34 years old and my husband and I have had several talks about it and came to realize that we would have children for all the wrong reasons. It’s just something that we don’t want to embark upon. It’s not meant for us. I feel at peace and I actually told this truth to my therapist about finally feeling at peace knowing I don’t want children of my own. 

We have different plans for our life partnership together. I just was wondering if this type of situation has ever happened with anyone else. 

I actually work with several women trying to conceive ironically, which I love doing. So I thought maybe that’s what she felt? But either way it was a very interesting experience and the more I thought about it it solidified my decision to live childfree. 

It just seemed really insensitive to the fact that I was not heard. And that now the idea that something is telling you a higher power wants me to have a child will heal me. There are other ways of healing and that doesn’t necessarily mean I need to have a child to do so.

But I do that because my apartment doesn’t allow pets and I wish I could get a dog. What if my bf likes meeting children because he wants some of his own some day?

I’ve talked about this with my bf many times and he always assures me he doesn’t want kids, but the way I see it, if his family’s medical history is all he’s worried about, he could want to adopt.

We’re talking about getting married soon, and I guess I’m just looking for some comfort. Those of you CF folk who love children, why do you like them? Why do you remain childfree? If you’re in a relationship, how does your partner feel? How do you balance your opinions if they’re opposing?",childfree
Simple observation,"I had a student arrive In class today and related some disturbing concerns. I made a mandatory report just now. 

I have to pass a drug test, background check,endless papers and exams for my education, mental and physical health screening, CPR certification, and a flu shot to be around and work with kids from 8-3:15

Yet in order to possess a child all I would have to do is get cream pied. 

There are tons of fantastic parents out there. Caring, nurturing, and safe adults. God bless you all for the work you do - your kids are turning out 👍 great. 

After what I hear from other children about their parents - I wonder why some people are allowed to steal air.

MLM Alert!!!,"I just now got to work and there's a bunch of CNAs in my supervisors office smelling these little samples that look like lip gloss. They're actually scented wax for a simmering pot. 

You place a tea candle in the bottom, the wax on top, and it makes the house smell *so* good. 

Now, this particular CNA who is a mother has made comments such as, ""I'm not racist but my husband is"" and has been known to treat people of color differently (at least in the workplace: I've never seen her outside of work and I call it out when I see it but we work different shifts)

I go into the office, inquire about what it is and she said she wants a little extra money for her kids Halloween this year. 

I was like, ""Oh okay."" I sniffed a few and then told my supervisor I'd be on the floor since all the CNAs were in her office. 

I have the last laugh though because year before last, I got a secret raise for my seniority and experience that nobody else received. 

Not only do I make more than you, but it all goes to *me* and I can buy all the Halloween crap I want because I don't have kids! Not only that, but I'm better at what we do than you are as my paycheck clearly shows.

Kid at the office. Best birth control.,"My husband texted me while he was at work today.
Husband: do you know that loud colleague I told you about?

Me: yes? Is he loud again?

Husband: that... And he brought his loud kid.

Me: who brings his kid into an office for a working day? Couldn't he get a babysitter?

Husband: this is about the third time he has brought his kid. the kid is about 8 I think? Shouldn't it be at school? 


Seemed like the dad forgot their kid had free from school that week and he forgot babysitting or something. SMH. My husband filed in a complaint.

Later that night, my husband and I both sat on the couch at home. 


Husband: that kid was as loud, maybe even louder than her dad. So busy too, I heard it through my headphones. I have an headache. I never am wanting to have kids!

Me: best birth control?

“So why do you teach then?”,"Because I am an elementary school teacher with a long term partner, people often assume that I have children or I want to have children. When I say that I don’t, I get a lot of judgement thrown my way. I get asked, “why do you teach if you don’t like kids?”

Childfree &amp; Happy at 47,"I just joined this community to say something: 
I already pass through all of what society can say about me not having children, imagine my case, I’m Mexican, Woman, 47 years old, if today you are criticized at 30, 15 years ago was unthinkable in Mexico ...Today, I see all of the problems that my generation is having with the teenagers not just 1 but 3 teenagers at home. 
I love my sisters and I see their suffering, one of my sisters said to me: if I would go back in time, I wouldn’t have children either. 
Not because they don’t love their children, but because they perhaps would have only one baby instead of 2 or 3. 
Nobody told them the amount of work and commitment that you need to dedicate to each kid individually. 
Today, I have to be a little far from my family because I cause them weird mixed feelings. 
By now they are upset with life acting like
.  “Why nobody told me that not having children was an option” 
.  “Why my sister didn’t tell me about it, I would be as worry-free as she is now”
.  “My 2 sisters love me and hate me at the same time, no matter how much I love my nephews and niece, they have against me this permanent complaint about ... why you didn’t shared your secret. 
The truth is ... I walked my path in secret, no explanation, in some way I discovered that I didn’t want children until I turned 40
I remember running away from any men proposing family and kids, returning rings, and when I finally got married, I requested the divorce before having kids, not having a boyfriend and I finally married a man who didn’t wanted kids 💛
Today I’m so happy, rested, quiet, living a peaceful life. 
I wish all women in the world think twice before having a baby, if you want to be a mom, go for it have one baby and wait 5 years to have a second baby, what is the rush ? 
Make a life plan for the first baby.

"Weird question, looking for honest answers. Is it irrational for me to want to get sterilized when I'm not even sexually active, and never planning to be?","So I'm (20F) aro ace, sex neutral bordering on sex repulsed. Basically I enjoy sexual pleasure through solo activities but I never want to engage in relations with someone else. Point is, I'm probably never going to be sexually active.

I'm very childfree. I don't hate kids but I'd certainly hate to have them. I prefer cats and reptiles.

I don't have any medical problems with periods and such, they're actually very manageable. I have cramps only the first day or two, and the periods only last three or four days which is awesome.

I've been thinking that I really want to get sterilized, some time in the future once I've graduated college and have a career. I don't know, I'm like irrationally afraid of getting pregnant, I want to make absolutely sure that it can never happen. Like on the chance that I get raped, it's always possible. Plan B doesn't work 100% and I absolutely do not want to be faced with an abortion. I know it seems kinda extreme but isn't it better to be safe than sorry? Or am I actually being fucking crazy and need to chill out? I definitely feel like if I went and asked to get sterilized they would laugh me out of the office since I kinda have no reason to.",childfree

I’m not your babysitter and I do understand.,"I’m at an age where all my friends are now having children and life for them pretty much revolves around kids, which is fine. I see them less and see my non parent friends more. No problem. 

Over the summer we all had a bbq get together type thing. There were 4 kids and almost twice as many parents. I was sitting on the floor chatting with some other CF friends when one of the mums has a dig at us for not helping with the kids. 

We ignore her. Not our problem.

Today it came up with one of my closest friends who’s a dad. I commented saying it’s not my job to help with children. I’ve no interest and I’ve built my life based on that. Both parents to each child are present, no need to call on me. This guy then has the audacity to say I’m wrong and that I don’t understand because I don’t have kids. Fuck no I’m not wrong. And what’s there to understand? Everything a parent does has to be done with baby in mind.. if your can’t handle it, that’s your fucking problem.

Needless to say, I’m now cautious when things are organised involving children.",childfree
How best to communicate my love and support for a childfree friend?,"I'm not sure this is the right place for this but figured I'd give it a shot.

I have a dear friend (from childhood!) who is childfree. I love her like a sister and I've always been supportive of her decision.

Unfortunately, like many others in this subreddit, she has encountered a lot of hostility from the world, both subtle and unsubtle, about her decision. For instance, she and her husband of one year told their parents shortly after their wedding they didn't want kids. The phone calls, guilt trips and pleas for them to reconsider have not stopped. Because of this, I feel like she has frequently felt the need to be defensive and I totally understand why. It must be exhausting to constantly have to remind others that your decisions are valid even though they don't understand them.

Additionally, as more of our friends have kids, we've had many drunken late night conversations about her feeling like she's being ""left behind"" as others seem to forget that she has a life, a schedule and needs of her own. Others also will say some subtle things about the transformative joys of parenthood in a way that makes her feel like they're putting down her decision. TBH, I feel like it's our super tired friends who are almost justifying their decisions to themselves who say stuff like that.

I recently found out I'm pregnant and I'm just about to show but haven't told many people. I want to share this news with my friend but I want to do it right. I know this will change my life and schedule just as going to college, starting a new job, etc., have changed my schedule in the past. I still wanna make an effort to make sure she continues to feel I care. While I do want her to participate in my child's life to the extent that she wants, my friendship with her is what I value with her -- not her relationship with my child. I already have sisters and other friends with and without children who I know will want to be very involved in my baby's life, so I don't think we need everyone to feel super invested.

For childfree folks who have friends with kids who make you feel supported, what sorts of things help you feel loved?

Fencesitter - Does loving the process of raising a puppy mean that I might enjoy parenting?,"I just want to state for the record that I do not equate having a dog with having a human child, I understand the differences. However, getting a puppy with my husband has caused me to (mentally) move away from CF and closer to the fence for the following reasons:

- I can honestly say that I love this 3.5 pound puppy more than I love myself. I would jump in front of a car for her, no question. 

- The first 2-3 weeks of having her, we thought we made a mistake. It was a lot of work and we weren’t prepared for it. But I look back now (3 months in) and can say that it was all worth it and I would do it again. 

- The amount of joy/pride that I feel when she learns something new is incredible. 

- I worry about her constantly - our vet is probably tired of fielding all of my, “She’s doing this, is that normal?” calls. 

- Before getting a puppy, I always cringed when someone said they couldn’t do X, Y, or Z because they had to go take their dog out. I didn’t want something like that keeping me from doing whatever I wanted! But now....we are those people. And it’s what I want to do because I love her so much. We either tailor plans so that we don’t leave her by herself for too long or we bring her with us. 

- I love watching my husband interact with our puppy. He’s so loving and seeing him so happy makes me happy. 

So I guess maybe my question is really geared toward dog people who also have a child. I’ve said things like, “I can’t believe how much I love my dog!” to coworkers, and the response is always, “Wait until you have kids!” So...is raising a puppy a good “test the waters” exercise to see how one might feel while caring for a human child? Or are they really two completely different experiences?

My husband has drawn positive comparisons between caring for a puppy and a human baby (he’s more pro-baby than I am at this point, but we discussed it at length before getting engaged and he’ll be happy either way) but I’m always quick to point out that a dog, ultimately, can be left at home if we need to go somewhere. There are plenty of places that a baby can’t go, but you can’t just leave them at home, they have to be cared for by someone else while you’re gone. I think that’s my biggest sticking point right now, which tells me that I really do value my freedom and flexibility, which is why a puppy was a much better choice than going all in and having a baby. 

TL;DR - Basically, I am very wary of the idea of having children - I think it’s something I need to be 150% sure about before doing it. And I’m not sure if enjoying the experience of raising a puppy (the good and the bad) is an indicator that I might enjoy being a human baby parent.",childfree
"Flexibility for everyone at PWC, not just parents!","I just read a great article from Harvard Business Review about flexibility for all at PWC (big accounting firm). They specifically refer to people without children! Link at the bottom.

“Everyone deserves the same degree of flexibility. Flexibility is not related to a generational need. Every employee, at any age, benefits from and is looking for its availability. A culture of flexibility will not be created, adopted, or embraced unless the origination stems from an understanding and belief that every single person in the organization deserves the same consideration and flex work policies. This isn’t about one segment of the workforce, so if you’re sending out any kind of internal communications materials about flexibility, make sure it speaks to all employees. After all, we are a diverse workforce made up of diverse people, from working moms and dads to thousands of others without children who also want flexibility. One person’s reasons for needing flexibility are not any more important or any less important than any another person’s.”

Producing life more important than saving a life?,"No advice needed, not angling for praise but this sub reminded me of something that happened a couple of years ago that I wanted to share.
I (F 40-ish, childfree) decided to donate a kidney to a random stranger about three years ago. Had the operation, feel fine and am still happy with my decision.

The surgery ment I would be on sick leave for a couple of weeks. Luckily in my country the system does work and (to put it simply) I still got full pay and the government covers all costs for replacement during my absense. The same rules apply when women go on maternity leave. 

I was unpleasently surprised by my bosses reaction when I told hem (quite a few months before the procedure) about my decision.  At first he could only see the difficulties it would have in the workplace and that it would be very bothersome if I was on sick leave for 6-8 weeks.
That same employer had only praise and congratulations a year earlier for my co-worker (same job) that announced her pregnancy and had been on leave for 4 months (and, after her leave, could spend upto 25% of her work day to nurse her baby).

Don't bring your toddler/child to events if you can't keep them quiet...,"My boyfriend and I visited an expert guided mushroom tour. We both love searching for mushrooms regulary and really hoped to get a bit more in depth knowledge. Sadly a bunch of people brought their kids. 

Sure, going on a mushroom search with your kids might be a fun activity (at least for older kids) BUT this tour wasn't about actually getting mushrooms, the aim was to learn more about mushrooms in general (it was clearly labled as that). Luckily our guide was an academic who focused on in depth knowledge and didn't even try to break it down for the kids. Obviously it was boring as hell for the children. The older children were fine, they started playing together on the side. But one couple brought their 2 1/2-3 yo toddler. This child was very vocal, ""talked"" non stop and pulled out every single mushroom in sight and brought it to the expert.

The toddler interrupted him every single time he talked. You could easily see how very annoyed he was and he told the child off many, many times but the parents only made very few half-ass trials to calm their toddler down.

A rant because I'm losing my sanity over this.,"Sorry in advance.


I am really reeeeeally sick of breeders tbh. 
Like, I've been asking for sterilisation since I was young since I used to have insanely heavy periods (16 days off, 7 days on, going through 4 to 6 full pads daily). I was put on Cerelle and finally relief, they stopped. 
Every smear I've attended (and it's a lot due to abnormalities and family history of cervical cancer) I've asked over and over again and I get the same antics every time that I'm too young, I'll change my mind etc etc etc. 

I basically offended everyone this morning when the topic came up again as I'm waiting for biopsy results from a Colposcopy (which was an incredibly awful experience for me as I'm scared of pointy things and my cervix currently has unexplained inflammation) and basically said I hope it comes back bad because then I might actually get the goddamn hysterectomy I've been asking for.

I know it's horrible to say because no one wants cancer or wishes it on anyone but I'm at the end of my tether.
Between ovary pain constantly and anxiety every time I indulge in sexual activity, gloved and pilled up or not, it's been ruining my life for years.
I don't want kids. I hate them, I refer to them as crotch gremlins and the sound of them laughing or screaming makes my stomach turn. 
The thought of getting pregnant scares me so much that my sex life is basically a nerve wracking experience where I've never been able to truly relax and have fun. 


Apparently I might still want them. I'm 27. I've hated kids since I've been one myself. I've never played the dolly games of being a mum, I was happier reading books and petting cats.
I got asked what I would do if I fell pregnant and the answer of ""yeet it out of my uterus asap"" apparently wasn't the right one. 

And it's all because no one will accept that I am happy being child free and will continue to be so for the rest of my life. It's bad enough I have mental health issues (Bipolar II) that already make things stressful. I feel like getting rid of my reproductive parts would help my sanity to a degree (obviously not fully because BPD doesn't work like that, but it's one load off if that makes sense?)

I'm sorry for such a long winded rant but I've been on and off between anger and crying every time it gets brought up because I just want it gone and the goddamn breeders won't allow it. 
I just need it off my chest before I explode. My husband is totally understanding as we're on the same page with it, but apparently even that's not enough.


Edit
I just want to say thank you for all of your words today, it's really helped my sanity since I've been dealing with this all bottled up.
I'm gonna present the idea to my colposcopist (again) regardless of the outcome of my biopsy, since he asked ""IF he found anything, what would I like him to do"" and I replied with ""Get rid of it and the rest of my reproductive"" and was told not to make such a rash decision and to think on it.
He's kinda my hope at this point that he'll give after seeing how panicked I was during the biopsy alone that maybe putting me under and giving the works would be the way to go.

"""it's not the same as having your own"" ; ""you don't know real love until you have a kid"" ; ""they are a woman's purpose in life""...","I saw a heart-tucking documentary last night that puts every bingo into its respective place, namely into the corner in the most elegant way possible.

Tibet is located at the hefty altitude of over 4.000 m high and for this particular reason, the sun's dangerous UV rays are stronger and more dangerous than everywhere in earth.

So Tibet has what the documentary called ""the blind kids from Tibet"". People from Tibet are four times more prone to get grave eye disease because of the sun and thus many children there are blind (it's indescribable how much my heart aches to see them😭).

One day, a woman from Germany, an *angel* I could say, who's also blind (and she's still riding her horse alone) , moved to Tibet and along with her partner, she opened up a school in Tibet exactly for those children (28 children) and she teaches them English, math and the art of massage, from the donations that she raised. But that's not all. She doesn't just teach them basic school subjects; many kids are far from their respective homes so they stay there like in a boarding school and so this lady helps them adapt and survive as blind people. She walks with them through the streets, she teaches them how to use and enhance their other senses in order to recognize a restaurant, a toilet, a market. She's the one who first brought a cane for blind people in Tibet and gave it to  these  children. She basically gives them a chance to be as normal as possible and survive. She protects them and cares from them. 

During the summer holiday, she and her partner went to another region of Tibet for fundraising so that they could open up another school for blind children.

Those children were happy to learn from her, they were happy when she bought them fried potatoes from the market or when she led them to the market to smell and touch scrumptious fruits. They were jolly and all smiles when they were in her class and around her. 

When she threw a farewell party, those kids cried because they love her immensely.

Her parting words for the interviewer were:""... It's like they (the children) are all *my* children"".

Sooooooo... What are the typical bingos? That it's not the same as having your children? That women don't have any other purpose outside reproduction? That one doesn't know real love until their have their own kid? That they don't have any other life purpose? That cf people aren't useful to society? That we are *selfish*?

Hahahahahaha---

---no.

How about THINK AGAIN.

Breeders, look into that angelic woman's eyes as blind as they are and see that they contain more light inside them than in their condescending and selfish ones.

This woman is someone who's contribution weighs immensely; instead of giving up, she's a fighter, a voice, a leader and her altruism is spanning to sacrosanct. She creates a better world for the already existing children that aren't blood related because she has a selfless, beautiful pure heart. Because she cares.

And I dare to say that, despite her obvious eye condition (her blue orbs were peeking sideway like someone's who suffers from strabysm), she is so beautiful. She's beautiful on the inside and outside.

The storm brewing on the horizon is my mother. My mom has this thing about wanting what other people have and comparing me to other people's adult children. I am her only child, and therefore her only shot at grandkids. I had a hysterectomy two years ago for medical reasons, and was pretty set on being childfree before then. She wasn't too big on the bingos then, save for the occasional ""your father would love a grandchild.""

But this is different. Her brother is going to be a grandfather now. He's going to get to know something that she never will, and because I know my mother and I know the way she is and I know that she's overbearing and dramatic, I know that the bingos are coming. I haven't heard anything from her yet, but I'm sure they're on the way, and they're gonna be fast and furious. 

When I told my husband the news, I didn't even have to tell him my suspicion. He just looked at me and said, ""Oh, fuck. Your mom.""

So I guess I just gotta get ready to hear about what a disappointment I am yet again, this time because I can't/won't have kids.",childfree
"After a few years of consideration, getting my first job has made me realize I definitely don't want kids.","I'm 17 and have been working at this place for about eight months now. It's at a regional grocery store chain, and I usually work weekends. But *god*, I really don't understand how anybody could be confronted with the reality of children and how they impact your everyday life and still decide they want one. 

For one, kids are expensive. The families of five or six - hell, even just your typical nuclear family of four - are the biggest spenders. Easily go through $350 worth of crap, usually processed junk food and frozen pizzas. 

The parents always look so tired, if both parents even bother to do the shopping. Usually it's a mom staring blankly into space, hair messy with heavy bags under her eyes. ""Kids, y'know,"" she'll say, and *fuck* am I glad I don't know. I see so many mothers talk about how their husband is ""their oldest boy,"" which is honestly the most disturbing part of the nuclear family. It should never be socially acceptable for your own life partner to act as your *mom*, too. 

Kids are messy. Kids are the ones I see spilling shit, drinking juice out of bottles their parents haven't paid for, opening boxes in the shopping cart, getting crumbs everywhere. My store gives out free cookies to kids, and at the end of every shift the cookie stand is absolutely trashed. They've got to clean it several times a day.

Parents are inconsiderate either out of their own ignorance, exhaustion, or lack of caring. I hate it when parents stick their kid inside the shopping cart. It blocks me from reaching their items, so either I have to get the kid to move or (what usually happens) I have to crouch and grab whatever it is they're blocking from behind them. You know how many parents have yelled at me in the store for touching a hair on their precious angel's head? Too many. Or, they'll get their kid to hand me an item. I'm sure you think your Little Johnny looks adorable spending five minutes handing the cashier his singular box of raisins, but when my register times the number of items I scan per minute, and when it's the busiest hour and there's four other people waiting in line behind you, it's not appreciated. 

One of the things I hate the most are those shopping carts meant for parents to stick their kids into shaped like little cars. The basket is much lower, so I have to reach my entire body down to scan things. The other day I was doing just that and the little tyke sitting in there *reeked* of piss. It was strong enough to make me gag. How could you let your kid through the store like that? 

Kids are distracting. And look - I don't hate kids. Kids are kids. I can't get too mad at them. If a little kid is old enough to talk and they're trying to get my attention I'll probably humor them. But if your child is wandering around unattended and they decide to walk up to me and use my scanner, or play with the carousel, that's crossing a line. Parents never seem to want to discipline their kids in public in a reasonable way. Seems like it it's either complete apathy or enraged screaming with nothing in between. I honestly feel bad for the kids. 

So ultimately, this experience has solidified the fact that I never want kids of my own. I see these tired parents and all I can't think of is *I never want this to be my life*. And I'm going to make sure it never will be.",childfree

"""unpopular opinion"" Of every single possible action on this planet, having kids is the most selfish","A person having a child is not the most selfless thing in the world. People wax lyrical about how selfless they are to have kids. Society praises parenthood. It is deemed by some as our ultimate purpose on Earth. People sacrifice their lives for their kids. However, it is actually the most selfish decision one can make. Let me explain.

Barring unplanned pregnancies, people who have kids often actively try to have them. They are deliberately, on their own volition, choosing that they are going to bring a new life into this world. It is an ultimate act of god, on par with taking a life. It is the ultimate act of self-determination enforced on something that does not have the ability to consent, and has no choice but to be alive. They are taking the risk that the child has some severe abnormality, and people offer condolences to parents when that occurs. Not withstanding medical advances in detecting abnormalities, the fact remains that it was a choice. Does it even occur to the wider society that this life has had to suffer due to the choices made by a parent? Parents grieve, but ultimately, the one who suffers is the child. Is this risk worth, just so a person feels complete in that THEY accomplished THEIR own dream and fulfilment? They view it as a natural progression in life, and something that will please their own parents, and perhaps an investment for their future when they grow old. Parents often project their own expectations, own wishes on what having a child will do for them. It is unfair to give birth to something because of expectations of what it would do to one's own life. They may have a dream of having a loving, caring beautiful child who grows up to make them proud. Honestly, parents need to make themselves proud instead of creating someone else to fulfil their fantasy. The problem is that people are generally not self-critical enough to think of that. I hesitate though to call having kids a primal instinct in humans though because we have the capacity to moderate our own actions.

Society is harsh and unrelenting. In many countries, kids have to compete from a young age, there are many more have nots than haves. It doesn't change when one goes into the working world. Why must we insist on bringing in more people to suffer. If we can't get society right, why are we adding to the problem.

My own parents, without a doubt, cared deeply for me and provided me much more opportunities than many, and for that, I am grateful. Their lives were very much focused on their children. They were devoted. I have been fortunate. However that does not diminish the fact that it was very much their choice to give me life. Do I have a duty to care for them? My answer is surprisingly no. They made the choice, it remains their duty to care for me. However, I do love and care for them out of kindness, and the fact that they had me when they didn't know better. Would I honestly have not been born? Resolutely yes. One of my siblings died after choking on his own vomit due to a congenital disorder, and I myself struggle with my own mental health. After some discussion, my mum agreed that it would be best if I had not been born, if she had known better. If I was totally healthy and happy with life, would I still say that having kids is still selfish? Yes, it inherently is, but of course this is a very unpopular opinion.",childfree
Best friend is now pregnant,"I (26M) have always been strongly childfree. Thankfully, since I am a transgendered male that chose not to freeze my eggs before transition, I will never be able to have children. My best friend (23F) had an accident involving a horse falling on her that led to doctors telling her she would never be able to have children. She has also always been childfree and so that has been a big thing we've been able to bond over throughout our friendship.

Well... Now that has changed. She called me at 2am a couple of weeks ago in tears, telling me that she had a horrible dream that she was pregnant. So, out of paranoia she took a test and it was positive. 3 more tests and a doctor's visit later and it's confirmed. Even worse is that she was in the process of trying to leave the father because he's incredibly toxic and threatened to beat her during a recent fight. I, of course, told her she needed to make an appointment at planned Parenthood ASAP. Sooner the better. She seemed on board with the idea as I expected her to be, given our shared childfree lifestyles/views.

Fast forward a week of not hearing from her and I get a call. She tells me that she's decided she can't morally go through with an abortion, is giving her boyfriend another chance because now he's being incredibly sweet (he's expressed wanting her to have his kids in the past. Definitely a breeder), and she doesn't feel right putting a child up for adoption. I was and still am shocked. 

I guess the point of all this is that I have no idea what to do/how to process this all. We are very close and live on the same street, so we're a huge part of each other's lives. I just can't believe her decision and feel like I'm going to lose my best friend. I can tell how depressed she is about this and she keeps saying she knows her life is ruined now, but she has to live with her mistake. I hope and pray she won't change as a person, but I'm already starting to see little things. Comments that almost sound 'loving' when referring to ""bean"" inside her. Not being able to drink like we normally do on the weekends when we have dinner together. Possibility of cancelling our February snowboarding trip being brought up, because... Pregnant. And what about after the crotchspawn is born? She says now that she understands I will have no part in baby's life. Sorry, but I just won't do it. Can't stand kids. But somehow I just know I'm going to get asked: ""hey, can you hold the baby for just 2 minutes while I go do this thing?"" And if I say no? Then I'm just the asshole kid-hater. 

Maybe I'm just being selfish, but she's like my sister and I'm so depressed knowing what her life is going to be now. I'm terrified for her. I told her I want to do everything I can to help her make the most of these last 8 months of freedom. I feel like it's all I can do for her. I just needed to get this all off my chest and I figured you all would be the only ones that could possibly relate to how I feel about the whole situation.",childfree

Easy Grocery Store Experience,"So I buy baby food (mostly sweet potato, squash, spinach with some fruit...good stuff like that) in those squeeze packs to wolf down a couple times a day during work.

The cashier at the grocery store (older woman) was ringing me through last week and as she scanned the baby food she asked “do you have a little one at home?” And I said no, that I eat these at work as quick snacks to keep up with proper nutrition.

CF ≠ hating kids,"While some CF folks aren’t particularly fond of kids, being child free doesn’t instantly mean we hate children. I was accused of hating children again this past week after showing a ‘friend’ some posts from this sub that explain why I’m CF. 

Here’s a wild one for those who do place that assumption: the most important person in my life is my 1.5 year old baby cousin. 

I babysit, I watch the stupid ass kids shows, I cringe as she makes messes, I put her down for naps, I make her bottles, I take her for ice cream, I do the baby voice... the catch? I do these things once a week. 

Honestly? this little girl is one of the most behaved kids I have ever encountered. She listens well, she does problem solving to communicate her needs. She rarely has ‘fits,’ and they’re only ever when she’s sick or overtired. 

She’s the ‘ideal’ kid, and I’m in the ideal position to be able to help raise her but only have to work as caregiver 15% of the time. 

I don’t hate kids. I adore her, and I can enjoy the presence of kids. Breeders are mad because I have an open schedule, endless energy, and yet I also have the ‘joys’ of parenthood you all lecture us about. 

Even if not for my love for my baby cousin being proof, calling me a ‘child-hater’ isn’t classy.

Like no mom. It has nothing to do with your parenting. I just don't like kids. I just don't. You wonder why I avoid them whenever we see them out in public?

Having friends with kids is exhausting.,"Vent time as one of the last CF people in my friend group. Throwaway account so I can complain freely and pettily. Obligatory disclaimer about how being a good parent is hard and I try my best to be supportive of my mom friends, but...

Trying to get together with parent friends is a nightmare which increases exponentially depending on the number of young children involved. 

Reciprocal acts of friendship are hard to come by. It often feels like everything is in service of making their lives easier but the favor is seldom returned.

It's almost always on me to come to them because it's a hassle to either pack up all the kids or to get a babysitter (most of my friends have 2-4 kids--conservative religious areas FTW). One of my good friends lives 30 minutes away and she is almost never able to come meet me closer to where I live. If I can't make the drive to see her (usually at her house), it's hard to make it happen.

And even if a time can finally be agreed upon, venues are limited. I'm losing count of how many times I've asked friends to grab dinner or lunch and they ask if we can just pick up sandwich stuff from the store and meet at a park instead because restaurants with their spawn is too hard. Or they DO bring the kids to the restaurant and it is, in fact, a nightmare because there's three of them under the age of 8 and this is how the conversation goes:

Mom Friend: ""Hey, so what's new? Tell me about your life?""  
me: ""It's great, I actually just started this new project at work---""  
Mom Friend: ""JIMMY, get off the floor! Yes, I'm ordering you pancakes. Anyway, sorry, go on.""  
me: ""That's okay, I'm starting this project as a new manager on this team and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by--""  
Child: ""Moooom, Jimmy won't let me see the tablet!/I didn't want macaroni!""  
Mom: ""Oh my god, Kayla and Jimmy, SHARE! Anyway, please continue...""

...on and on for 45 minutes. 

This is made only marginally better if the meet-up is moved to the parent's house but then it's often replaced by mom's inability to be present with you because A) the kids are still bugging her relentlessly or B) now that she's home, she's splitting her attention by trying to talk to you while bustling around cleaning things at the same time. You try to help out, but quality of conversation just never really happens because of the sheer distraction.

And in general, it just seems assumed that I'm free as a bird because I have no kids, even though I have a full-time job, a spouse, volunteer obligations, and mental health issues of my own. 

I try really hard to be a giver to my friends--time, money, a listening ear, free coffee, whatever. I'm just feeling really bummed and hurt and emotionally depleted today because they just don't have the bandwidth to give much back on the occasions that I need it.",childfree
Broke People Having Kids,"One thing I've noticed is that a lot of people are starting to drop off crotch droppings and I don't mean to throw any shade but they are not in lines of work that produce living wages. Here in the NYC area, you need at least [300,000 a year](https://www.financialsamurai.com/living-a-middle-class-lifestyle-on-300000-year-expensive-city/) as a couple to make ends meet. Yet I see people who make 80K which is like 80 Cents in NYC, NJ and Connecticut, having kids despite that and they live in the heart of the city, like Coney Island, Newark, and Pelham Parkway. Expensive areas.

What gives? We live in the age of the condom. I hated being raised poor. There's no way I would have a kid if I made less than 300,000 a year and my spouse made less than 100,000 a year. I know someone who moved out of the city when she had kids which is great, although she inherited a medical office condo to work at after her parents went back to her country. She and her husband barely make the 300K mark which sucks for having a kid in the first place.

After reading the book Dream Hoarders I know that kids raised poor like me who didn't end up in jail are a stochastic minority. Why are poor people like me trying to increase the amount of poverty and hunger in the world by producing more offspring. I have no idea. My parents were stupid for reproducing in the first place for example and they were brainwashed. In today's world there are more role models for adults that don't have kids.

Edit: Broke people that live in SANE parts of America and other countries, go right ahead and have kids. I'm telling people in NYC, San Francisco and LA that they shouldn't reproduce. This is not classist this is more of an anti giant city rant.",childfree

Why are kids so mean to animals?,"Not sure if this is the right place for it, and it obviously doesn’t apply to ALL kids, but it’s one of the many reasons I’m seriously considering a CF life. 
I visited some family recently, and the kids know I have had pets and volunteered at an animal shelter. We were walking around outside when a group of the boys (ages 8-12) started causally talking to me about things they’ve done to animals. One laughed at a squirrel caught in a trap his father set up, and then he says he saw it die later because no one bothered to release it. Another says he shot a staple gun at a stray cat and they all laughed. 
One time years ago I was looking at a big fat colorful caterpillar on a bush in some shopping outlet (because that’s just what I do), and some kid saw what I was looking at, smacked it off the leaf, and stomped on it. 
Don’t even get me started on the shit they did when I was working at a pet store (I was naive back then and thought it would be fun). They banged on the fish tanks and bird cages. One put a beta fish in a tank with aggressive fish that ate all its fins while it was still alive. One parent asked me why her kid’s pet birds died- I can’t even bring myself to say what she let her bratty kid do to them because ten years later I’m still scarred. I know this is partially because of crappy parenting but it’s such a common thing with these “sweet innocent angels.” Heck even I was shitty towards our pets when I was five and I so deeply regret it. But to hear my own family members talk like that, with their strict but loving religious parents (surely they’d learn to respect “God’s” creatures?!) just further deepens my general dislike of children.

Love Letter from a Non-CF,"I hope that this is allowed. 

While I myself am not CF, eagerly awaiting the day I can be a mother, scrolling through this subreddit, I never realized how harsh people can be towards just the idea that someone doesn't wanna have kids.

A Baby is Hospitalized thanks to the Parents; a Reminder it's Parents Themselves who Can be the Real Monsters,"EDIT: CPS IS INVOLVED STOP SPAMMING ME TELLING ME TO CALL THEM. ONE OF YOU DOING THAT WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

At the hospital I work at we will soon be starting week 3 in terms of how long a pediatrics patient has been here. I don't even work with this patient directly but I have a work buddy who does. What's wrong with this patient? Well...

The poor kid is 26 days old today. He's there because his good-for-nothing parents don't want to take care of him. Initially he'd been having hospital visits since he wasn't gaining weight. The parents bitched about needing to take him in because of gas expenses, not really caring that they were doing such a horrible job feeding him. They didn't think he needed to be fed as often as suggested and the mom got bored fast trying to feed him (he's being breastfed and the parents are too lazy to want to try a formula supplement via bottle to help him along).

Fast forward and he's only gained a bit of weight and now has a kidney infection because the parents didn't want to change the diapers. He needed to be admitted and the parents push all the work of taking care of him onto the staff, insisting they need to catch up on sleep. 

They continue to be shit parents and typically only show up to claim their free food from Dietary (the mom is morbidly obese and eats enough to feed 3 people each sitting) and barely want to interact with the baby.

On top of all this the mother has a 12 and 8 year old from previous relationships. She does not have custody of either child and hasn't seen the 8 year old since she was 1. The dad has an almost 4 year old who still wears diapers and it's a miracle she doesn't have any issues liker brother considering how little they change it as well. 

The 4 year old had a bunch of bruises and the parents cut her off whenever she started talking about them, saying the nurses didn't need to ""know their business"", which is alarming. Some kids are rambunctious and get bruises through how they play but it makes you wonder when the parents try to hush it up. 

It's even more suspect that the parents did it when, at one point, the dad got so annoyed at the girl for grabbing at his phone he grabbed her fingers, pulled them back, and threatened to break them if she did it again.

There's a chance that the baby might be able to be able to go home this Thursday and it had better not be with them. I honestly want the little girl to be taken away too. Social Services is involved but we all know how worthless they are. There's been plenty of cases where child neglect/abuse has been reported up until the child's eventual death.

But please, tell me again how childfree folk are monsters; how our community is so toxic because we get upset over lousy parents who shouldn't be allowed to breed, kids getting away with hurting animals, or not being too happy about a crying baby/terrified child in an rated R movie.

Hell, even our more ""petty"" complaints don't hurt ANYONE. Who gives a shit if some of the posts make especially those outside this community roll their eyes? We still live in a world where childree folk are almost seen as freaks/selfish.

One thing we can say is that we've never been the cause of a poor baby getting a freaking kidney infection. I would NEVER be able to forgive myself. We know we don't want to be parent for various reasons and I see that as being a much better person than one who can't wrap their heads around what birth control is and keeps bringing children they can't handle into this world.",childfree

It should be illegal for children to be allowed to scream bloody murder,"It should be illegal for small children to be allowed to scream bloody murder for like 10+ minutes. i know this sounds dramatic but hear me out.

My new neighbors don’t watch their kids and they’re always outside, and these kids just fucking **scream** on the top of their lungs, and this shit is constant. Like I don’t even understand how their vocal cords can handle this level of screaming. 

If these children were to be brutally murdered in the middle of these screams I honestly don’t know how any adult would know the difference. Why is no one teaching these children “the boy who cried wolf” story?!

And it’s not just these neighbors. I used to live in a totally different state in an apartment complex with a playground in the courtyard... and it was the same shit.

It’s not cool to yell “fire” in a movie theater or “bomb” on a plane. I’m pretty sure it’s illegal. So I think it’s reasonable that this type of thing should get the parents in that same kind of trouble. I understand if the kid gets hurt or is throwing a temper tantrum.. those things usually end within a couple of minutes. But this play screeching goes on for dozens and dozens of minutes.

Not wanting/being able to have kids does not make someone less of a woman,"I was watching this video about a trans woman and had a scroll through the comments to see who was worthy of my quick witted and scalding responses. One in particular caught my eye. A mombie saying “HE can never be a woman for HE does not have the body parts necessary to bear and give birth to children which is the one main role of a woman. So that means he is not one’ 

WELL I FUCKING WENT OFF

I immediately told this mombie that ‘SHE is a woman and the inability and lack of want to have kids doesn’t change that. What? Am I not a woman because I don’t plan on shoving a few out of my cooter?’ There was soooooo much I wanted to say to this woman I swear to god. I wanted to throw hands. But then I decided I’d give her a break and pray that her kids give her absolute HELL  

I do not wish bad upon the kids or the mom. I just hope that they spew on her best rug. Her best clothes. I hope the ones in potty training pull a my little sister and take a dump and piss on the sofa. (See why I don’t want kids?

Child free because of partner?,"I have a really interesting thought I’ve been mulling over. I’ve always desired motherhood in some capacity, slightly less now into adulthood.

I’m considering just telling my parents I can’t have kids.,"Some background: I’m an only child and my mom had a very difficult pregnancy (something she has never let me forget). She had to have daily shots to make sure she was getting enough vitamins, her body had a hard time adjusting to me growing, and she ended up having to have a C-section when I was about 37 weeks because of medical complications. I was born with jaundice (aka bad liver) and my lungs never fully developed due to being born premature. 

Now, today, I’m almost 25 with a college degree, a stable full time job, my own place, no partner, and a mountain of student loan debt I’m paying off myself. Honestly, I’m pretty fucking happy with how my life is right now. However, I know my parents are going to start asking about grandkids soon, but the myriad of health problems I inherited from my mom (uterine fibroids, blood clotting issues, etc.) make pregnancy very high risk for me, never mind the fact that I don’t actually want kids at all.

On to the point, I’m considering telling my parents that I can’t have kids at all, or at least they my gyno strongly recommends I don’t get pregnant. I’m not really lying, just stretching the truth a bit. I know I should just come out and say “I don’t want kids, get over it” but due to a lot of past family issues it would make my life a lot easier if I just told them I can’t have kids at all.

I just don't know anymore,"Hi ladies and gents. I am 24 years old and a female. For most of my life, I was certain I did not want kids. My Mother did home daycare so I grew up with kids until I moved out at age 22- I always found them to be quite annoying whilst living at home. 

More recently, I have begun to wonder if I would like to have children. However, I wonder if this is truly ""my wants/needs"" influencing this idea, or if it a response to social norms; i.e. that as a woman I am ""expected"" to have children. I am very confused as of late.

I am very career motivated and feel like I could create a lasting ""legacy"" through that route, or by returning to school to get my doctorate degree. My partner is 27 and is firm on not wanting kids.

Has anyone else faced ambivalence like this? It's so confusing!! I fear by not having kids I'll be missing out but on the other hand, kids are not the only path to meaning/creating a legacy in a person's life ......

Children in a museum,"I've never posted here before, but I just have to express my frustration. I went to a museum of [notably breakable material] yesterday with my family. It was a wonderfully pleasant time, roaming the gallery and enjoying the atmosphere. That is, until two different families come in with their ridiculously loud children. Now, I don't necessarily think that museums have to be silent places where you can only whisper and tiptoe around BUT these kids were full on sprinting around, chasing after each other and SCREAMING. How is that okay? Why are you just letting your kids do this in a museum, much less a museum where everyone is surrounded by expensive, breakable pieces of art???? It drove me up a wall. Also, as someone who gets very startled and somewhat irritated by loud noises, having the pleasant quiet broken by that was horrifying. I don't even particularly dislike kids, I just don't want them myself and I'm usually more understanding about these things. But I was just stressed to no end because of this nonsense.",childfree

You can't afford a kid? Who cares? Have one anyway!,"I was listening to the radio and they were talking about younger generations not having as many kids as boomers. The conversation was between a young woman (30-ish, let's call her Amy), an older woman and a man. 

So Amy starts laying out the typical reasons why Millenials have chosen to have less kids: not enough income, unstable jobs, dying economy, climate change, etc. One of the things she says, apart from mentioning that many young women are CF and are very happy with their decision (yay for her!), she also said that young people now choose to wait until they have a stable job and have enough money in savings before they take the step. Sounds reasonable, right? Not for the boomer woman!

She claimed young people are doing it wrong by acting that way. That we're ""obsessed with control"" and we can't hope to know the future. So it makes more sense to have kids now and ""then you'll sort things out, somehow"". She assured Amy that we're wasting our time not having kids *now*. That we would miss experiencing something so special just because we wanted to ""control"" our lives.

It's mind-blowing to me that Amy was there, being so rational and saying: ""Look, we can't have kids if we're unemployed and have no savings and no stable lives. We need to wait until we can make sure we can give the kids a good life"", and this dumbass was all: ""Oh no, don't be silly! Just have them now! You'll sort it out"". Yeah, how? Will you be there when the parents can't feed their kids? When they can't afford to buy them clothes or buy the meds they need when they get sick? What's so wrong with wanting to wait to have a stable life before you procreate? It makes all the sense in the world!

My Story and Painful IUD Insertion Experience 22F,"
Fist post here, I think I flared it right, as I’d like some support.

I’ve included trigger warnings for this story, please let me know if the list needs to be updated!


TW: mental illness mention, description of pain,  food poisoning/vomit mention, kink community mention, weight loss mention



So I’ve lurked on here for a long time but I wanted to share my story on what happened this Friday. I know I’ve been childfree as long as I can remember. I got Nexplanon, the arm implant when I was going off to college, and loved it, even having a replacement one put in this year when it was time. 

However, I was still  super anxious about pregnancy. I despise children, they are obnoxious operate on emotion alone, and are therefore too much to handle. I am a very large woman, so any pregnancy would be difficult for both me and the fetus, a fetus that I would have no intention of carrying to term anyway. I also struggle with bipolar disorder, so I can’t imagine how I could deal with being pregnant while keeping my shit together.

So, I asked one of the doctors on the list if I could get sterilized. He said I was too heavy and would need to lose a certain amount of weight in order for him to consider the surgery safe. (50+ lbs). I know he was right, but I still needed a way to keep my anxiousness down, even if I couldn’t get the surgery.

As a compromise, he said he could give me an IUD to supplement my Nexplanon so I would feel more secure while I tried to lose the weight.

I agreed that something was better than nothing, and we made an appointment for me to put my IUD in.

I was not prepared for the pain. I’ve had both of my nipples pierced,  but this was the worst pain I’ve ever experienced in my life. I’ve been in the BDSM community for years, so I have slightly higher pain tolerance than the average lady. I honestly  thought that this would be a walk in the park. I was expecting a little discomfort, but this was a stabbing pain unlike anything I had ever experienced. I When he clamped my cervex, I cried out a bit. It felt like a little knife straight up me. When he measured my uterus I screamed as quietly as I could. When he inserted  the device I was crying. When I was released, I was wobbly and sweating. I basically peeled myself off the table. I got an apple juice, which was much appreciate, he’s a good doctor for trying to think of ways to get me less shaky. He said I did a great job and there was no problems. I shudder to think if there had been complications, or if I had a uterus that tilted to the side or something.

Regrettably, I did consume sushi before the procedure, not thinking anything of it. I think I got food poisoning cause I drove home and thew up a few times. 

I’m happy I had it done,  and the pain is mostly gone, but I just need some emotional support right now. Has anyone had similar experiences with their IUD insertion?",childfree

Someone isn't giving all their attention to the kid, yep you guessed it more screaming. The other parents there would actually just laugh when she did scream, which would encourage her to do it more.

Am I a sociopath because I never emotionally bond with children (even family)?,"I've never emotionally bonded with a child. My nephew was born when I was 8 and I couldn't have cared less. I found babies annoying even then. My niece was born when I was 10, same thing. My family chalked it up to me being a kid myself and assumed that I'd care more as I got older. Nope. We've always been a tight knit family but I had absolutely zero interest in babysitting them or coo-ing all over them. Now they're both pretty cool young adults and we talk occasionally but that's it.

Recently, my brother-in-law had a baby. Well, not that recent. The child is turning three next month. My in-laws want me to go down for the birthday party but honestly, I really just don't feel like it. Work is busy this time of year. I just got a new baby bearded dragon who needs three feedings per day and I'm not willing to leave her with a pet sitter because she JUST started getting used to us. My partner is going to go down for two days and I'll of course send a gift to give to my nephew. But, apparently, this is a huge deal now. Apparently three is super important for some reason and the fact that I'm missing it is an issue (not with my spouse but with my in-laws). I mean, as far as kids go, my nephew is well behaved but I don't really feel bad for missing his birthday. He won't remember it. I feel for him like I feel for all human beings -- empathy if he is hurt, hoping he is feeling well, etc. But I can't say that I feel super bonded or anything. I do feel bad for not feeling bad, though.

Am I a sociopath? I bond instantly with animals. I have cats, a parrot, and now a bearded dragon and I feel for them in the same way that I assume people who love kids feel for their kids and their relative's kids. I worry that there's something wrong with me because even when I try, I just can't establish that feeling with children of my own species. I got accused of caring more about my cats than my nephew and, honestly, I hate to admit it but they weren't wrong. I'm definitely more maternal and bonded with my cats.",childfree

Talking to someone who was CF their whole life,"I recently had a very interesting conversation with an old ''boss'' of mine (I stopped working with him about 2 years ago, but I still keep in touch with him and we go for coffee ever few months).

My old ''boss'' is past retirement age now, but he continues to work in volunteer positions because he genuinely enjoys it. I'm sure that if he wasn't having health problems he would still continue to work to a higher capacity in his field.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, he was CF with his late wife, and I asked him if he ever regretted being CF. This is what he told me:

*""Children were never explicitly off the table with his wife. However the two of them didn't get any pressure from* ***their*** *parents either. His parents were fairly progressive people (for the time). They were educated and respected people in the medical field. He talked to his wife about children when they were in their 30s. They decided that they would revisit the subject later in their life. Then 40s rolled around, and 50s, and it wasn't something that they felt was needed in their lives. He is much older now, and says that he doesn't regret the decision that he made earlier in his life. It was the right decision for them at the time.""*

The reason I'm sharing this is because I'm past my mid twenties. I don't explicitly talk about possible children with my family or friends, because I am a fence sitter. However, most of the unsolicited advice advice I get goes something like this, **""If you don't have children soon, you will regret that decision when you're old and not able to have them anymore.""**

I asked my old ""boss"" what kind of advice he could offer someone who is unsure about children. He did give me some advice, and I'm not sure if you will care for it - but here it is:

*""Don't dwell on the topic too much. Revisit this every few years, and see how you stand on it. He and his late wife talked about it once in their 20's, and then decided to revisit it when they were in their 30s. In their 30s, they decided to revisit it in their 40s. And then it wasn't even an option anymore because having kids wasn't even possible in their 50s. He said not to have my entire identity revolve around children, or the decision not to have children. Put a pin on it and keep revisiting it every decade with your partner.""*",childfree
CF makes sense in (average income) Western culture but maybe that does not necessarily translate.,"Please hear me out.

There are countless reasons for being CF; some have tokophobia, some don't like children, some have ethical objections to adding to the population or bringing someone into an uncertain world. Some have health conditions they don't want to risk passing on, some think they won't be good parents. Or any combination of the above. These are all valid.

Another reason is due to the negative impact a child would have on lifestyle and on the relationship with one's partner. I am talking only about this reason 

By Western countries I mean places like North America, Europe, Australia &amp; New Zealand.

In Western countries the culture is one where the basic unit is the individual. This is a sociological observation. If you want to work and have a child your career will suffer. You will be paying at least a thousand dollars a month for full time childcare for one child. Otherwise you are imposing on others for free childcare. Or stuck at home for financial reasons. If you want to go anywhere you have to plan in advance and pay someone like $50 for a sitter just to go out for a dinner and drinks. You can't travel easily. In the USA the maternity leave and healthcare costs are ridiculous. One can't afford one's hobbies or have time to pursue individual interests.

CF is a no brainer.

However in some cultures society is ordered differently. I'd rather not say exactly where I'm from and in any case similar arrangements are in place around the world.

In some places the basic unit is the family. People live in family compounds with several generations living together. Sometimes there are separate houses but very close together. Children are raised communally. If you want to go somewhere for a week, there are countless people happy to look after them and the same goes the other way. In this setup the togetherness people are raised with allows children in the family to be a collective responsibility.  The loss of freedom associated with childrearing is not present. A western person would not enjoy this setup. A person raised this way sees this as the way the world works. Some may opt out. Some find it fulfilling.

I now live in a western country and don't have the social structure that allows having children not to be crippling.

If I had millions in the bank maybe things would be different. One could employ a chauffeur to do all the ferrying to and fro children's clubs require. A long term contract for x2 night nannies job-sharing a shift working 8pm to 8 am, the same for a day shift. Then add in a housekeeper and cleaner. Plus a travel nanny, maybe a tutor and a sport coach. Throw in a music tutor. They would be the support crew a couple needs to raise a child and still live their lives.  You could argue that this is an abdication of responsibility and why have kids then. There are anti-natalists who think the human race should end. If you do not support that position, someone has to have the kids and there has to be a way to do so without destroying the parent's life.

 I was wondering what members the CF community think about this position.",childfree
Confession: Not having a nurturing personality and lack of maternal instinct makes me feel guilty and depressed,"I am 28 and childfree. However, the more time  I spend with my friends who are mothers (excellent mothers at that), the more guilty I feel for not having an urge to have children or that my ""biological clock"" is just not ticking at all. My interactions with children are awkward and feels like an act. It comes so naturally to them and I sometimes wish I was the nurturing type that so I that I wouldn't feel like such a cold person and hate myself for it. I'm childfree majorly because I have depression and anxiety, and I feel overwhelmed by the simplest things and having a child would obviously make it 10x worse. I didn't have a special bond with my parents and my mother wasn't exactly a natural, this also made me feel like I would do a terrible job if I did have children. On top of that  it would wreck my marriage if I go that route.

But still, when I look at my friends with kids, I admire how naturally it comes to them. They are great mothers who planned having children and really wanted them, and they truly enjoy being mothers. They had the childfree life before they had kids, so they are not missing out on all the fun stuff like travelling. I have seen the 'kodak' moments but I have also seen them exhausted and struggling. But seeing them sit back and watch their children makes me wish I had the same. Their children are well-behaved and polite because they have attentive and nurturing parents.

"I don't have a 'job', I'm a housewife with no kids, so what?","I'll share this. Many people probably think I'm a lazy oaf, well, I probably am, and the thing is, I shouldn't care, and that people who shame this life should mind their own business.

I'm unable to have kids, and even if I could, I would feel pressure to have kids just to give others a 'legit' reason why I'm a housewife. However, that is a horrible and selfish reason to have kids, and well, it won't and can't happen anyway.

Am I a failure? Do I contribute to society in the way people think I should? In the narrow aspect of professional achievement I have none in this state, granted, but I do not define myself by that. I define myself by whether or not I can answer to myself or my loved ones at the end of the day. For me feminism means to be able to do what you want, being a housewife does not set it back. If you want to be a career woman, cool. If you want to be a housewife, cool. I have a college degree with a very high GPA, and it is possible that in the future, I may go to medical school, or I may continue to be a housewife. If I become a doctor or remain a housewife, I'm still worth the same in my eyes. I must live for myself and my loved ones and learn to ignore the judgement of society. If I can make my partner happy and worry less about the household, that increase their ability to focus on their job, and in a way that also contributes to their professional success.

Do I have enough finances to keep me going that is not from either my parents or my partner? Yes, I have passive income and if my partner leaves, I'll still be financially viable. I'm not financially dependent on my partner either. I pay half the rent and utilities for our place. My job is to do all the housework and cooking. My partner is not the least resentful for my choice, which is critical for this to work.",childfree
Friends and their two kids visited,"One was a crawler but he just kinda flailed around on the ground while the little girl was three years old. She could talk and walk well enough but is just energetic as any kid that age is. I just stayed out of the way since I was visiting the folks when they turned up, so I'm sitting in the lounge and cradling my parents dog while the kids did their thing

The dog is nervous around new people- he's a toy breed so he's uneasy around flighty kids so he took refuge on my knee. I let the girl pat him while telling her to be gentle and calm with him as he's nervous which she listened to; when she patted him she didn't tug or yank on him or his fur, instead just patting his side carefully and not being noisy. Point 1!

Then later when she was free roaming I could see her from where I was in the lounge, and she was poking at my mother's make up like twisting the lipstick and pulling out the mascara stick. She noticed me when she was pulling at the mascara tube and I just mutely shook my head at her when she noticed me.

To my surprise she immediately stopped messing with the tube and put it back in its place before coming back into the lounge. Point 2!

And later when she started doing that horrendous high pitched banshee scream children do my mother cut her off and told her that was an 'outside' noise and to not do it indoors. The little girl didn't make that noise again. Good parenting! Good child! Point 3!

Like seriously they *can* be well behaved and it's always so good to meet a little kid that actually listens and has been raised properly, especially if you've recently been to a supermarket where the parents there usually just ignore their screaming and tantrum throwing children lol",childfree

CF mindset could be hereditary,"My mom accepted my CF stance and have been really supportive of my decision. 

Recently, she was briefly mentioning about my grandma’s life(dad’s mom). I don’t have memories of her since she passed away when I was 2.

Apparently grandma did not want kids but ended up having 4 kids (possibly social pressure and lack of contraception in those days). She was a doting mom to all 4 but internally she felt miserable and snappy. She was quite introverted and loved crafting all the time. Her misery moved my mom and my mom never bingoes in general. Mom also feels I’ve inherited a lot of qualities from this grandma 

Mom suddenly had a realisation and said “probably a CF mindset is hereditary and you inherited this from grandma”. While I felt sympathetic of my grandma, I couldn’t help but chuckle at that sentence’s irony",childfree
Almost mobbed by breeders in the tube,"This happened yesterday and I’m still quite shocked. The London tube was very crowded yesterday, I was in a bit of a hurry because I needed to go home and get ready for a concert I had in the evening.

I managed to get onto the tube and was standing right next to a mombie with a stroller who kept leaning against me and more generally being aggressive (assumingly because she felt like I was standing too close to her precious bundle of snot, who by the way wasn’t in the stroller). The kid kept stepping on my (white) shoes but I was trying to just get over it and not say anything I’d regret.

At my stop, it was almost impossible to get out and I tried to quickly make my way out between two other strollers (yes, there were three of them, blocking both potential exits), slightly tripped because another mombie was pushing her thing right into my legs, and nearly fell out on the platform. She then yelled at me, I can’t even remember what because at that point I could barely understand what was happening. Then comes out a tall, muscular, aggressive man (baby daddy? A third, separate, crotch fruit owner?) and starts yelling at me „you almost fell on my babyyy“ (no, I only almost fell face down on the fucking platform) and threatens me, then pushes me. His attitude indicated he wouldn’t hesitate to punch me (a lightweight female) for that perceived slight towards his babyyy. So my friend and I promptly got out of there which was probably the only safe thing to do. 

This generated so much stress on an otherwise great day. I was really frustrated because I couldn’t even defend myself in any way, apparently breeders own public transportation now.",childfree

I'm childfree because I had to spend years taking care of my parents when they should've taken care of me.,"""I'm childfree because I had to spend years taking care of my parents when they should've taken care of me.""  
\--Is the realisation I've suddenly come to upon this subreddit.

I've always known for a while I didn't want to have kids in my life, but generally I thought I just hated kids. I knew I couldn't ever take care of one because I lack emotional stability, and if I'm unable to offer such a basic thing for a child, why would I ever sign up for that? Though after reading somebody elses post, It almost felt like a sudden feeling of clarity washed over me.  


I've spent years taking care of the emotional needs of my parents when they were the ones who should of done something for me. I *shouldn't* have been the one to sit and listen to you talk about how you wanted to &gt;!die!&lt; when I was only a little kid. Meanwhile, when I tried to talk about my depression with the people who were supposed to emotionally support me, I got called selfish.  


I was put in a situation where I had to be my parents personal therapist and venue to vent their adult frustrations out at an age where my emotional state was still developing and molding into what it is now.  


I've been taking care of kids all my life and I didn't even realise it.   


I know I can never use this as an example of why I don't want children to their face, but this really made me understand as to why exactly I never wanted children of my own, And really made me understand my entire outlook on life and where a lot of my childhood depression / current depression probably came from.

Reason for being CF,"It's just like the title says, what are your reasons for being CF?

I'm CF because kids are just way too much trouble to deal with and cost nothing but time and money. Time and money that I rather spend on myself and on my interests.

Another reason is that I wouldn't be able to properly take care and raise a kid. I can just about take care of myself but add a kid into the equation and you get a recipe for disaster. It doesn't help that I have autism and a rather low emotional IQ, which makes me emotional rather distant.",childfree
My mother is just the best,"This is gonna be as short and sweet as I can make it. 

So, local elections are today.

Yesterday, as I was talking to my mother on the phone, this blessed woman asked me who my fiancé and I want her and my dad to vote for, because ""it's not their future anymore but ours"" (even though she's only 50, and knowing her, she's going to be kicking around for at least another 50).

I mentioned in another post how pro-kid my country's current government is, but in summary, there are billboards all over the country announcing to the world this ""financial aid"" program for new families that involves insane conditions. Basically, you apply, get a huge loan of 10 mil max -for comparison, minimum wage is 130k/month-, and have FIVE YEARS to have three or more kids. If you have those three kids, your debt is forgiven, but only kids born DURING that period count, no kids you might already have, or kids who are born after the allotted time runs out, so you better go at it like selfish, greedy bunnies. If you apply and don't have enough kids, you're stuck with a debt you can't afford to pay (because why else would you apply, if not because you don't have the money to start your life?), and kids you had for purely selfish reasons that never even panned out well. (Need I say, there are a lot of people excited about this. A coworker who is pregnant now is planning to take it, and have four ""or more"".)

Every time I see those ads, they make me furious, not only because it's irresponsible as hell, but also because... we have money to sling around for THIS, but not to help already existing people?? Because money is suddenly so tight when it's about refugees, but we have enough to burn when it makes babies be born? 

Anyway, I told my mom that I don't really want to dictate what she does, I just want a vote for ""ones that don't plaster town all over with 'have-three-kids-by-30-and-get-a-loan-you-can't-pay-because-you're-raising-three-kids' propaganda"".

All she said was ""good, at least you two haven't lost your minds, I'm proud of you."".

I have no problem telling her that we decided not to have kids at all. Not going to mention my plans to get fixed because she'd worry (my grandma, so her mom, had to get a hysterectomy for medical reasons when I was 13, and it was hard on all three of us, even just seeing how it affected grandma physically), but I'm 100% certain she is always on my team.",childfree
Recently child free after spending one evening with a child.,"So basically what the title says.

I went to visit an old friend and her kid is 4 years old. The sweetest little boy. I've always been prettty good with kids since half of my family decided to be teachers and I have to deal with the kids sometimes.

So I get to her house and I brought pizza. Just a normal visit, nothing more.

I see the kid and he asks my name. I talk to him a little and I decided to go sit next to him. He immediately gets on my lap and starts treating me like I'm his new dad(dad is not really in the picture). I decide I need to make some space so the kid doesn't get too attached.

He then asks me to bathe him and put him in bed. He doesn't want his mom to do it and for her sanity sake I decide to do it.

Put the kid in bed and read him a bed time story.
Spent 3 hours playing dad, didn't have any pizza and only got to talk to my friend for like 2 hours and I felt drained and tired while chilling.

No kids for me. That was way too much effort and time.

Advice dealing with pregnancy anxiety on the casual circuit?,"23 Single M, morbid fear and hatred of children. I have a lot of casual sex but every single time I get anxious afterward about the girl becoming pregnant. I use a condom everytime (regardless of whether she's on the pill or not or whatever) always careful and never had any mishaps but I absolutely can't shake the anxiety in the back of my mind after any encounter which only tends to abate after a certain amount of time has passed or I find out she got her period. I always end up googling and convincing myself that I could be a part of that small ""perfect use but still pregnant"" percentage or reading stories about supposedly impossible pregnancies.

Anyway does anyone have any idea how to get over this or some perspective to share? It's really beginning to irk me that I can't enjoy an active sex life without this irrational level of anxiety gripping me.",childfree
Got sterilized yesterday!,"I just got my tubes removed on Friday and I wanted to make a post about my experience. This ended up really long but eh I'm bored and just felt like writing it all out. Thanks for reading if you do!

First off, I just turned 30 this year. I've had bad reactions to all kinds of birth control to the point where it scares me to keep trying different kinds. Luckily, this didn't matter for the past 7 years as I was in a sexless relationship. Several personal realizations this year led to the end of my long term relationship, though, and I suddenly found myself in a very different situation, one which suddenly involved sex again.

Not really knowing what to do, I made an appointment with my gyno, who I had just started seeing earlier this year because she is also a specialist regarding PCOS. She was the first doctor I saw who didn't give me a weird look when I brought up how I believe a hysterectomy is fully on the table as an option if I can't get my PCOS complications under control in the next few years. Even though I want one to protect myself against higher risks of cancer, I still always got the ""what if you change your mind?"" questions about how it would make me unable to give birth. I'm trying to protect myself from cancer and all they can talk about is having kids!

Anyway, she wasn't like that when we talked about it, she actually agreed with me that it's a real option. So I was hopeful when I went in to talk to her about possibly getting sterilized.

GUESS WHAT!

I was right about her!

I told her what I wanted, she asked me some questions like having me tell her how long I've known I didn't want to give birth (since 7th grade at least) so she could hear the conviction in my voice, went over birth control options again so we could discuss why they're not good for me but know that I'm fully aware of them, went over my health issues with me that make me giving birth more complicated even if I wanted to, and then said she had no problems with it. She told me about the different kinds of sterlization, I told her what I wanted, and that was that. She gave my info to the finance department, they contacted my insurance to see what they'd cover (100% as preventative care), and then they called me to schedule everything. That was about a month ago.

The scariest part at the hospital yesterday was when I couldn't pee for the pregnancy test they insist you do beforehand, and they had to do it from blood instead which takes a lot longer. So I was sitting there feeling so paranoid it would come back positive, and every time a nurse came in I asked them if the result was back yet. The dread and anxiety I felt for those 45 minutes was horrible, and all I could think about was how after I had this surgery I would never have to feel like that ever again in my life. That horrible feeling while I waited made me absolutely certain this was the right decision for me. So in a way I guess I'm glad for that, haha, even though it totally sucked.

The actual surgery was very quick and went smoothly, and it just took me awhile to wake up from the anesthesia. I was groggy for hours but really not in much pain. I've been taking ibuprofen and tylenol every 6 hours regardless but I didn't need to take any of the stronger painkiller they prescribed me until tonight, cause I did start feeling more stiff and sore and though it wasn't unbearable, I just wanted to get ahead of it. 

Really, though, it has not been bad at all. I have two tiny incisions on the bottom of my stomach, sealed with dissolvable stitches and skin glue, and that's it. My throat hurt pretty bad yesterday from the tube they put down it while you're knocked out but that's already going away. I've just been chilling in bed taking it easy but am not even really overly exhausted today. Thankfully I have Monday off work anyway and I fully expect to be fine to return to my normal schedule on Tuesday.

Anyway, I just felt like writing this all out. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have one, and I'll also be sure to add my doctor's name to our wonderful list of sterilization friendly doctors. I know how lucky I am to have been granted one so quickly and smoothly. I've read countless stories here from people spending years either convincing their doctor or trying different ones to find someone who will do it. It's ridiculous it has to be that way, and I truly hope anyone else who wants it can have an experience like mine instead. I'm really hopeful my pregnancy nightmares will finally go away now lol

Overall I'm just really happy and relieved and wanted to share this with people who I know actually understand 💙",childfree
Human nature obvious in kids,"A lot of people refer to kids as innocent. I disagree. I think the selfish nature of humans is so apparent in children. they also love attention and get jealous easily. So many children I knew throughout my childhood did horrible things. So many siblings competed for attention. I think adults are much better humans than kids and people arent inherently very good. Rather, we learn how to be compassionate, empathetic, etc. Kids need discipline and to be taught manners and morals. what do you think?",childfree

Bingo’d ... with a bi-slap.,"Oh my god... I can’t believe what just happened. 
So many things were said, but I’ll boil it down to this: 
My boyfriend, his family and I were just having dinner at a hibachi grill. There was one other party at our table; A sugar daddy, his trashy date, and her poor 9 year old daughter, whose birthday they were “celebrating.” 
We put in our orders and started talking. Trash was seated next to my boyfriend and started badgering him. She asked us when we were having kids, and I immediately said, “Nope. I had surgery specifically so I couldn’t have them.” And she turned to my boyfriend and said, “Well I believe in god, and if you pray, you can get pregnant.” 

*cue face palm*

She spent the rest of the night getting more and more belligerently drunk, ignoring her sugar daddy, and talking at my boyfriend even though he turned away from her. Some fun tidbits also included her admitting that she is bisexual and then expressing sexual interest in my boyfriend’s sister, taking her daughter’s cupcake and squashing it onto her face, smearing icing all over her face and her daughter’s face, subsequently rubbing her cheek against her daughter’s hair so that the icing would transfer to it, telling me she would absolutely sue the school if they tried to take her daughter’s rainbow braid extensions out (I’m a former teacher, THAT one pissed me off), encouraging her daughter to practice her cheerleading jumps in front of the stove where the chef stands, and having her daughter rank us all in order of attractiveness.

[Rant] Grandma trying to take care of non-baby,"This was a while ago to preface, and it just recently popped into my mind again because it’s just so.. weird?? And kinda gross

My granny and I were having a conversation one day and we got on the subject of my boyfriend whom I’d been dating for about a year at that point. For some reason it came up about me possibly having a surprise baby someday, seemingly sooner than later. By the by, we were 17 and 18 respectively. I think she said something along the lines of, “You know if that ever happens, you can just leave it here with me and I’ll take good care of it.”

I’m sure you can imagine my confusion when I was just barely getting into college and him just starting. Even then I was very decidedly childfree, so I knew if I ever became pregnant I was getting an abortion no questions asked. All I could really say was, “Yeah that’s not gonna happen.” Because safe sex, plan B, and abortions don’t scare me.

And granny just insisted on it further for what I believe the reasoning is “baby-rabies”. Because I was a young gal in a loving relationship and despite how young I was I’m definitely gonna get pregnant. So obviously I was a way to get grand kids.",childfree

I'm scared of being lonely,"I never wanted to have kids, and still don't. Children repulse me to a visceral degree and I can count on one hand the amount of times I have handled a kid. But when I imagine the future, I feel like this aspect of myself will contribute to the fact that I will end up lonely. 

When I lived in Eastern Europe, I was part of a big family. Lots of aunts, uncles, grandparents, great-uncles/aunts, great-grandparents. Not many kids to hang with but I was part of a large family group. At any point, the house had at least 2-3 relatives in it, and holidays brought a packed house, lots of music/dancing, and company. Now, more than a decade after we immigrated, my family is scattered across the world. Only my parents and my baby sister live in my state, and they are more than a hundred miles away (although I prefer that, having a rocky relationship with my mom). I have struggled badly to make friends all my life, and don't hang out with anyone really on a daily, or even weekly basis. Only recently I was diagnosed with a rather severe ADHD with a rejection dysphoria, which threw some light on why I had one friend in high school (who didnt even go to the same school), and ate lunch by the lockers alone every day. Attention deficit makes it hard to understand social cues, remember little details like names and dates, and tell people apart at times (like face-blindness), and many people with it (like myself) will even have trouble making eye contact during conversation. And these are just the superficial barriers to forming friendships. I think I must come off cold or overwhelming to others and I've been trying to improve (I even made a flashcard deck of my classmates from our Introductory class pamphlet to try to finally learn their names). I still can't seem to connect with people, and never get texts from my classmates who I talk to every week to hang out. I just cant seem to make people stick, except for the couple of best friends I collected from many years ago (they live far away now too). I have a long term boyfriend, but we are long distance. So, I live alone with my dog and study, since medschool is my life right now. I feel lonely and broken because I see my classmates hanging out after school, but no matter how many social skills I try to develop and conversations I have, I can never seem to get invited or included. This seems unrelated to childfree but it is connected. 

Because when I see my life 30 years from now, I am scared I will never develop the ability to make friends and I will have no family for interaction. My decades of social failure seems to predict with certainty that I will never develop the Friends/HIMYM style friend group I so badly want. I won't have people to hang with for fun and comfort. My family is scattered and the ones I am on good terms with all live thousands of miles away, and since residency will probably take me even further out, I don't expect them to be all that involved in my life. Besides, they are all pretty elderly. Hopefully, my sister will be closer, and she's the family type, but it doesn't seem likely. My boyfriend/most likely future husband can't be the only person I spend time with because that will lead to annoyance, boredom, and other shitty outcomes for a relationship, especially with the pressure of a medical career. I don't really have a consistent hobby/sport besides gaming. The ADHD makes it really hard to stick to anything for longer than a week, so I know a week's worth of roughly 30 different hobbies. Not enough to join a club or group really, since I will likely stop contributing or being relevant there pretty quickly. I've tried.

And now that I'm more and more firmly set in not having children, it appears I won't have much of a family of my own. Kids seem to be a major reason adults to hang out together, from birthday parties, play dates, to parents night out. My parents met a lot of their friends through me and my sister. So I am scared that in 10 years, 20 years, 40 years I will be lonely. When my husband passes or if we divorce, I will truly be all by myself. And that terrifies me. I know that children are not the answer (although from constant trying and failing, I might be desperate enough to pop one out just to meet people haha), but this whole fear is one of a couple major reasons I still doubt myself (the other being ""missing out"" on some transcendental child-parent relationship that parents talk about). I'm sorry if the story comes off a sobfest, I don't mean to sound that way. I'm pretty happy, and too stressed/busy to truly be lonely most of the time. But I get these pangs of loneliness/rejection often and worry more and more about how my decision to be childfree might be involved. 

Can anyone offer any thoughts, or notes of comfort they found? Has anyone felt this way, or have any advice?",childfree
"Guess I'm supposed to be the ""do-over"" mother. Ew.","Throwaway bc some of my family know my Reddit account and I wanna complain about them on here. Let me also preface this by saying that while I am 100% CF, I actually really like kids. Just like 'em when I can give 'em back when I'm done, lol.

I have a niece who's 5 and a nephew who's 9 and long story short - they're probably the worst behaved kids I've ever met in my life. They talk back, they scream, they argue, they hit, they yell, they curse, they don't listen, you name it. And it's all because my sister and brother-in-law are the exact type of breeders this subreddit hates. I love my sister, but her husband is terrible. The reason the kids are like that is because he's a fucking awful human being and she doesn't stick up for herself.

My nephew has so many ***diagnosed*** mental and learning disabilities and he gets absolutely no help for them because my BIL wholeheartedly believes that those conditions don't exist and ""therapy is a fucking money scam."" He thinks the only way to solve those problems is with a sandal to the back of the head. 

My mother often brings up my having kids, and I always tell her the answer is a big NO. She gives her usual speech of ""You'll change your mind,"" ""wait until you grow up (I'm 27?????),"" ""I want more grandkids -"" That's the one where I stop her. I told her that she has one of each, why is that not enough? ""Well, I'd like more."" ""Don't let your sister's kids influence your decision, you definitely want kids."" No - you want me to have kids because you're hoping I'll have better ones. Real selfish, mom.

Feeling bad for the young moms,"I live in an area where there are tons of young moms (like ages 14-23) and many of them are single. I was riding the trolley this morning and there was a young woman (maybe 18 or 19) whose baby (probably 1) was SHRIEKING my entire 30 minute ride. She looked so exhausted, had bags under her eyes, let out multiple exhausted sighs, had the most blank, lifeless expression as her kid squirmed in her lap and cried.

I know that not every young mom regrets having kids young, but this isn't an uncommon sight in my neighborhood, and every time I see a girl like this, I get so much more solidified in my position to not have children. 

So many of my old high school classmates already got pregnant on accident, some even had their kids while we were still in high school. Some were even my friends at one point before we went our separate ways after high school. Hell, I have SO many cousins who were teen moms. I think the hardest thing was seeing a girl I went to elementary, middle, and high school with at a trolley stop. She had two kids in one of those dual strollers with a toddler on the bottom and an infant carrier on top. She was severely overweight and was smoking a cigarette while chatting with a couple cholos while her toddler was whining. I knew she was pregnant when we graduated, and I'd heard she got involved with hard drugs after her first kid was born. 

I feel so bad for her and the other girls like her. I'm only 22, and I can only imagine having had a kid younger than I am now, especially since my family is quite old-fashioned, so they're already questioning when I'm going to have kids. I know that if I had kids, I'd look that miserable too, and when I see those girls, I get much more grateful for my comprehensive sexual education and my IUD. 

I'm glad that that's not me, and I'm glad I'm not falling into that cycle that is prevalent in my community, but I can't help but feel bad for them. I know I shouldn't pity them because that makes me sound like I'm looking down on them, but I feel sympathetic to their struggle, and I'm setting my own precedents based on how I've seen their lives play out.

I just want to say, I'm sorry if you've made decisions that make irreparable, permanent changes to the direction of your life that resulted in you being miserable. I hope you find a way to become happier despite the path you've taken.

Sorry this kinda became rambly. It's just something I've always thought and just needed to get out.",childfree
There's an election here in Canada coming up. Candidates are giving more of a damn about parents than anyone else.,"There are tons of single people or people in relationships without kids. Get nothing. Fuck sakes, I'm on disability and I can't afford food AND medication. I have to make a choice. But yeah sure, keep giving money to these fuckwits instead of taking care of people like me who can barely take care of themselves.

Edit: Sorry, I've been having a shitty week. It's Thanksgiving weekend here in Canada. I don't have any family and everyone is showing pics of them being happy with their family. Meanwhile I have no real food for thanksgiving and I was panhandling (only to be arrested) for my meds. Maybe some food. I get home and someone knocks on the door trying to get me to vote for someone. First thing they mention is the child care benefit and how it'd be beneficial to have kids and if I have any then I can get money and vote for them so they can help children.",childfree
"Movie and wine night, always turns in to a babysitting party","So we're 6 girls in our 20s, where one of us have one kid and are single (has the kid 70%), and the rest of them wants kids in the future.

But when we plan a movie, wine and gossip night together, and it almost always gets moved to her house, and it ends up as a ""watch pingu and sober night"", I fucking hate my friend, and her kid. My other friends always try to accommodate, but I'm getting so sick of it.

"As a child, I hated baby dolls. Loved Barbie!","As a child most girls played with baby dolls but I never liked them.  I couldn't understand why a 3 year old wanted to play as a mother.  Mom got me a baby doll for one of my birthdays and she would tell me ""keep your baby safe"" and ""go to sleep with your baby.""  I just kept thinking ""I'm the baby!  I can't be a mommy.""

There was one toy I was totally obsessed with.  Barbie!  I'm a Barbie collector now...so that obsession never went away lol.    Fun fact:  Barbie has never been a mom and will never be a mom.  When she was created, they wanted a doll to represent the time of a girl's life between the ending of high school and marriage.  There are other dolls in the series of Barbie that have had kids...but Barbie isn't one of them.  Through her I was able to play as a doctor, Olympic ice skater, a vet, a mermaid, a teacher and many other things.  That doll made me feel like I could do anything I wanted to do and it does not matter that I'm a woman.  Which I think is pretty cool.  I don't get why Barbie gets such a bad rap.

[RANT] Why are doctors often only concerned about a woman's fertility?,"Last November, a doctor pretty much put my life in danger because she was only concerned about my fertility.

I was 15 years old, and having a lot of concerning symptoms, so I visited my mom's OB/GYN.

The doctor refused to listen to me, and claimed that fertility is the most important thing, not my symptoms. She told me that ""infertility is the worst thing that could ever happen to you"". Then she said, ""Come back to me when you want to get pregnant.""

Then, she just practically threw some new meds in my face. These meds were actually too dangerous for me to take, and actually could have killed me (I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm actually not).

She also absolutely refused to examine me at all, or refer us to someone who would, and refused to treat me, except with the meds she threw at me.

My breeder n-mom is pressing my younger brothers (19 &amp; 14) into breeding,"I'm 26F and haven't lived at her house for almost 15 years (lived with my father then with aunt). The fucking breeder has two more kids, all of us with different fathers, who mostly happen to be very problematic men.

She said she will care for the baby if they don't want it, but they should have children because it's ""the greater joy in life"". Let's make it very clear that she pretty much shooed me out of her house at 12 when she got pregnant with my younger brother because she couldn't afford raising all her children and I was the one she liked less, and that she is still poor as fuck.

Also, the boy is 14. She's really disgusting.

I don't have a lot of contact with my siblings because they still live with her (especially the younger one, who I never got to know well), but my 19M brother really looks up to me, and taught our other brother to do the same, so they're both hard-working (""hard-studying""?), don't follow her stupid rules, and firmly against having kids as well!",childfree
I (23M and CF) am scared of what’ll happen when my few friends have children.,"So...context. I’m in my early 20’s and for as long as I can remember I’ve been a very solitary person. My greatest joy in life is coming home from work and not being surrounded by humanity for a few hours with the exception of my family (they don’t count as “humanity” haha) and cat. As a result of my personality and preferences I’m pretty sure I’m CF. I don’t particularly mind kids for a short duration, but don’t want to be surrounded by them when Im trying to have a good time and don’t want them in the future.

The only real exception to my isolationism are a few of my close friends who I’ve known since childhood and have essentially grown up with. They’re part of a select few that can get me out of the house almost every time they ask to hang out. This has been the status quo for a long time and I’m comfortable with it.

Recently, however, I’ve been overcome with a fear that the status quo could change. Unlike me, my friends are all social and have “lives.” Most of them have girlfriends that they’re with and I imagine someday in a couple years I’ll be getting an invitation to a wedding, or baby shower, or some other thing like that. This would be all fine and dandy if I wasn’t the person that I am. Im not afraid that once my friends start families and have kids they’ll cut me out or something like that. I expect I’ll still be invited to dinner or parties and all that. What I’m most worried about is that they’ll expect me to interact with their children (like some kind of uncle) and I’m not sure I could do that. I can handle kids for a limited time, but once that time is up I start to wish either I could go home or that they weren’t around. As a result I worry that my friends will realize I don’t particularly like their children and will then pull away from me. 

I know I threw out a bunch of hypotheticals that could end up not happening, but it’s been gnawing at me for a while. As such, I’d like to hear what other CF people have to say. Have you had similar worries? Have you found yourself in this situation? What happened?",childfree
Advice on the childfree lifestyle,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some personal experience and advice on the childfree lifestyle. 

TLDR at the end

A bit about me - I am a 20 year old decidedly childfree individual. I have my doctors appointment booked for my sterilization, just waiting on that but I don't anticipate any issues as I have heard glowing reviews about the dr. 
So I look ahead of me and I'm wondering what sorts of goals I should aim for? Most people follow the life script and have kids at a certain time buy a house at a certain time retire etc. 
I am wondering, as childfree individuals who didn't have to save up money for kids or waste money on kids, how long did it take you to get to a financially stable position? How long did it take to afford that dream house/vacation/condo/fancy car/no debt/etc? What sorts of things do you find yourself able to afford that the average ""lifescripter"" at the same point in life as you generally couldn't afford? 

Any recommendations for cool things to do to fill my free time? 

I have finished school and I find myself floundering. My peers are all slogging away to attain that next milestone, and I've realized that now that I have a high paying job that will make becoming financially stable relatively easy I don't really have any goals to work towards! I think I work better when I'm working to attain something. I've fallen into a bit of a rut so some recommendations of super cool vacations, or some bragging about how early you could afford a nice car or fancy house would be awesome. 

TLDR: I've fallen into a bit of a slump now that I don't have any goals to work towards, so please hit me up with some super cool things you were able to afford/do because of your childfree lifestyle.

Cats vs. dogs and my therapist’s surprised face,"I just started therapy. I’m a 32 year old woman. My therapist is an 80 year old man. He keeps a therapy dog in his practice, and currently has a super sweet golden lab. 

I’m not very partial to dogs, as I was bitten when I was younger and they’re a lot of work. Despite that, I do enjoy his dog. We’re chatting about how sweet she is when he says “I just don’t understand how people prefer cats over dogs. They have so much love”
I said “Oh I strongly prefer cats”

He asks me why and I tell him “Dogs need so much. You have to walk them, you can’t usually just leave a bowl of food. They need constant attention. I can leave my cat home alone for a couple days if I need to travel for business” 

He responded with “Sure, but you could say the same thing about a child”

I said “Absolutely! I would never want a child!”

A brief moment of bewildered silence from the therapist. 

“Well, what would you do if your partner wants a child?”

“Oh... I would never be with a partner who wants a child. That’s a dealbreaker for me”

“Really?” He asks, still looking surprised. 

“Oh yes. I get that out of the way pretty early on. Plus I don’t have the ability to have kids at this point.”

“You mean biologically?”

“Correct.”

Holding a Baby...,"Last night I was at an event and held a baby for awhile. As you might imagine I got SO MANY comments:

How long until you have one?? 
You look so happy with a baby in your arms!
You need one of these!
You're so affectionate with him! 

And on and on. It was constant.

"As an adult, I want to have fun too","Okay... I thought this might be the best sub for this. This is part rant part discussion. This may be a little off base and maybe no one will agree with me but I hate the way kids always get preferential treatment if its something cool or its about fun. For example I recently went to a concert (it was not a children's type of concert). During the concert 3 people were pulled up on stage to participate in a game. One of the people the host pulled up was a child. I knew immediately everyone would deem the kid the winner and for some reason it got under my skin. Everytime there is something cool or some fun to be had if a child is involved its like a default. But it means just as much to an adult a lot of the time. But we have to ""give"" so children can have all the time. I'm not saying kids shouldn't have fun and get cool stuff too. Of course they should but why do adults have to give up anything cool for a kid to always have it. This happens with foul balls at baseball games too. I also recently took up acting class just for fun and there are probably 20 different types of classes available. Only one was an adult class so if I wanted to take a class in something different or a more advanced class I can't. Granted I live in a small city... I am sure it is different in a place like LA or something. But still... just because I'm an adult now doesn't mean I want fun to end... I still want presents on christmas and to get excited about dressing up for halloween, I still want to be able to take dancing or acting classes or learn a new skill, I still want to be able to get cool things at concerts even if a child is there.

My mom the bingo queen,"My mom is the all time bingo queen. She just won’t accept that me and my sister (who has Aspergers) will never have children. We both suffer from severe depression as well. This is a combination of genetics and the fact that our dad was an abusive asshole. My sister and me have discussed that we will not pass this misery on since we can barely take care of ourselves (we’re 29 and 24). We have explained this to our mom several times but she is convinced we will get better and change our minds. 

My mom was not keen on kids before she got accidentally knocked up with me and has had baby rabies ever since. She has had multiple miscarriages, lost our brother to SIDS and almost died during every delivery. The doctor flat out told her she wasn’t fit to give birth and to please stop. She finally had my sister (5.5 years after me). She stayed with my abusive dad for far too long due to this obsession with having kids. 

So back to the present. The subject of kids comes up every time I visit. The fact that I have a new BF is not helping. My BF has been a close friend for many years before the sparks flew. We supported each other throughout each others depressions and we’re both staunchly childfree. We don’t like the place this world is going and don’t want to burden our hypothetical children with potential mental issues. Depression also runs in his family so the genetic risks are too big to ignore. We don’t hate children, we love our hypothetical kids too much to put them through this bullshit. This way of thinking is why we get bingoed to hell by all of our parents. 

So yesterday we were visiting my mom and stepdad. They are selling their house in the city to move out to the country. My stepdad is already retired and my burnt out mom wants to stop working her office job and open a yoga studio. I think this is great and support them 100%. Only thing is that my mom keeps dropping bingoes left and right while giving me and my BF looks.

“It will be so nice to have more time for future kids running around”. 

“We are rescueing a dog so the kids can play around with him when they visit”. 

“We will have so much space for when kids come to visit”. 

During every one of these comments she is shooting me and my BF looks (you all know the one I’m talking about). 

It is important to note that my stepdad has two children who each have a kid of their own already. My mom is already a stepgrandma but that is obviously not good enough. I say something about how nice it is for their grandkids but this somehow irks my mom. She adds snarkely how there is room for many more kids accompanied again with the piercing looks. 

We just left shortly after. I give up people. Baby rabies is ridiculous and selfish. My mom needs to invest more into her stepgrandchildren and give up on the idea that bio grandchildren are somehow better. She needs to let me and my sister be or her time in the country will be pretty damn lonely quick. End rant.",childfree

Ok, terrific:  

Had a nice salad with the husband &amp; and then watched Netflix.  Fell asleep around 9:00.  Didn’t wake at all in the night.  

Saturday morning:

I slept blissfully till about 8:00, sans the sound of cartoons or kids on my bed.  Snuggled with my dog (I’m talking like we spooned because she’s on the varsity snuggle team). 

My husband got up and made pancakes.  We ate these pancakes.  We both snuggled the dog again.   

Because I don’t have any sports practices or fames to attend for the gangly, uncoordinated children I don’t have, I’m going to go to the gym. Maybe for an hour?  Maybe for 3?  I’m going to turn the notifications on my phone off and listen to music while I workout, stretch, decompress and empty my mind.  I’m going to them shower in no large hurry.   

I’ll go to my in-laws (who don’t yet know they are officially not getting any grandkids from me as of last Friday but a super sweet anyway), shoot the shit with my MIL, bake some shit, cook some shit, eat some shit when my husband arrives with my adequately snuggled dog, help clean up, drive home, maybe eat some more shit and definitely watch some more Netflix.

Vent/rant,"There’s a free outdoor gym in a park near me, I’ve been going there off and on for about a year, and one of the machines was removed this week because children destroyed it. This gym is directly next to swing sets, basketball courts, a soccer field, a roller rink, ping pong tables, bocce ball courts, and a designated hopscotch area, not to mention the four playgrounds and plenty of open green space within easy walking distance. The ONE SINGLE AREA for serious adult exercise is used like a playground, sometimes absolutely overrun by children, and I’ve seen so many kids use this upper body machine like a vertical see-saw. Now it’s gone.


I can’t be mad at the children, I can’t even be mad at their caretakers, and I don’t want to ban children from using the machines, I just wish this ONE GODDAMN 500 SQUARE FOOT SECTION OF THIS ENORMOUS PUBLIC PARK WERE TREATED WITH SOME GODDAMN FUCKING RESPECT BY PEOPLE.


I’m unreasonably angry about this, I know, but I’ve seen so many children play around these machines knowing it was dangerous and damaging and I wanted to say something but I held my tongue. Now it’s broken. Hundreds of entitled parents employing hundreds of underpaid caretakers to just let their children destroy public property. Why should I stand by? I should have told those kids to knock it off, I should have been stern and serious with the adults in charge, but I didn’t want to be a dick. I never want to be that guy, but at the end of the day there’s a hole where something useful once was, a little piece of this park that I quite enjoyed.  Maybe next time I won’t be so hesitant to tell random kids to stop screwing around.

When did you first realize you didn't want children?,"I just came across this subreddit and have had a great time reading all the posts. I am 31 year old female and happy to be CF, and happy to see others with similar views and rants. (literally laughed for 30 mins at some of the posts). It made me think about the moment I realized I didn't want kids, and all the things in life that enforced that.

I knew very early on I never wanted kids. I remember around 5-6 years old I think, we were visiting a friend in the hospital. While there I saw a woman who had arrived and was mid-way through labor, screaming and all. It honestly scared me. And then, I realized it seemed like the norm of every woman to have kids. I obviously didn't really know HOW that happened or anything, I just remember thinking ""do.. do I have to have a kid?"" and being terrified. I even talked to my mom about it. I said something along the lines of ""but I don't want it to hurt.."" because I realized labor was painful, and in my tiny child brain, that scared me, thinking I was doomed to be forced to go through that (on top of caring for another human being for years). My mom said ""well yeah hun it hurts for a little bit but once it's done you forget all about it. And you're just so happy to have the baby and love the baby so much."" I still wasn't sold. I remember literally losing sleep over it worrying about what was to be expected of me when I grew up. I felt like I had so many other things I would rather do. I feel like I was way too young to be thinking about that kind of thing, but I was. 

In coming years, I babysat my bratty cousins a couple times and hated every moment of it. Never took babysitting jobs ever again. I watched my mom struggle to raise me and my 3 brothers all by herself as a waitress, living in poverty. I knew my mom's life would be easier if she didn't have to raise us all. And as I got older and the years went by, I watched every woman in my life get knocked up. Teen years was always an accident, then in my 20's friends were having babies ON PURPOSE. It was insane to me. It was in my teens I realized I really did have a choice, but was afraid to vocalize it. I would mask it with ""I want to wait until I'm much older and stable."" I DID date a guy for 2 years that had a toddler, and that was an absolute fucking nightmare. The little girl was a total brat and her mother was a POS and there was always baby-mama-drama, and since she wasn't my child I would take no action of discipline when she acted out which was CONSTANTLY, I felt helpless. Don't get me wrong, I treated the child with care and she even got to where she would call me mommy. But still, after that relationship, I decided to never date anyone with young children ever again.

I admitted to my mom I never wanted kids maybe in my early 20's. My mom since has always said the famous words ""YoU'LL ChAnGe YoUr MiNd."" She still says that shit even though I'm 31 and it pisses me off. Like no the fuck I'm not. She literally once told me to get knocked up by my at-the-time boyfriend so she could have a grandkid, and that her and I could ""raise the baby together, we don't need him."" Yes, seriously, she said that. But I digress. 

I just feel like I was not born with maternal instinct. I never truly entertained the idea of having a kid of my own. Like, why? They're an absolute fucking money drain, time drain, and sleep drain. There's a million other things I've been able to do in life because I don't have a child. And it's honestly sad that for so long as a kid, I was terrified and thought that it was EXPECTED of me. I am and always will be incredibly annoyed by children. I find them sticky, smelly, and often loud and obnoxious. Some parents are simply insufferable. Don't get me wrong, sometimes I see a super well behaved, polite kid, and I think ""wow, good job parents,"" but some kids are just born with a better disposition than others too. 

As for y'all, do most people feel this way from very early like me, or does it click later in life for others? Did anything happen to make you want to be CF or enforce it?",childfree

Mostly I feel like I have a girlfriend half the week. She keeps bringing up how she struggles with the separation, weekly. I maintain independence is healthy, that my lifestyle is functionally unrealistic with children in tow, that this is a strength of our relationship. I attend events with loads of parents of young children, suppressing giggles when they complain, or downplay the things I do they just can’t. Things go AMAZING (mostly) for a year and a half. We gloat about how lucky we are to have found one another in such a small town, with so many mutual friends, etc. 

But she keeps fretting, melting down, about this notion of separation. It all comes to a head when she demands “basic consideration”, which turns out to be a level of mind reading that, when I point out she does not provide to me (because I am a functioning independent grownup), I find unreasonable. 

She’s right. She always is. Our lives don’t match up. I’m heartbroken and sad and scared and... it just fucking sucks. 

However, I do find solace and solidarity in this community. Thank you all.",childfree
In a Not-CF Wedding Tomorrow...,"And there's no alcohol allowed at the venue for the ceremony/reception either!

Conversation with my mother,"Today I came home from class and work feeling pretty tired from doing things all day. I was eating an early dinner with my mother and I explained how tired I was and that I might take a nap.

Mom: Better enjoy doing things for yourself now when you're young, when you're older you'll just be doing stuff for other people.

Me: What do you mean?

Mom: Well theres work, when you have a husband and if you have kids-

Me: I won't have kids and also (fiance's name\*) isn't useless, he can take care of himself.

\*she doesn't know we're engaged

Mom: \*silent\*

Mom: remind me again why you don't want kids.

Me (wanting to keep it simple without getting into how I'd rather kill myself than get pregnant and give birth and how kids would only be a burden to me): I just don't see the appeal.

Mom \*disgusted\*: You just don't see the appeal, I've only heard that very, very selfish people

Me: I don't see what not wanting kids has to do with being selfish. Selfish would be having kids that you don't truly want, that's not fair to anyone.

Mom: \*silent again\*

Mom: You had a great childhood, I spent so much time with you and gave you everything! I remember how happy I was when you first called me ""mama"" and took your first steps and- \*continues trying to make parenting look appealing but fails\*

Me: Ok, well I gotta go \*fiance's name\* is calling me

I've told her countless times that I won't be having kids but she doesn't believe me. I've been honest with her about my feelings so if she still thinks I'm going to change my mind she's only deepening her own disappointment when she doesn't have grandchildren in the future (I'm an only child). I wish she would listen to and accept me but at the same time I try not to let it bother me too much because my fiance and I are both Cf and I had a secret bilateral salpingectomy in early August so I've already won in the ways that really matter.

"""Some Families Have No Children.""","Part of my work involves running music programs for childcare centres (I'm one of those folks who love kids but don't want them in my house). Since my program is separate, I don't know a lot of the curriculum that they follow for their educational components, other than the overarching themes and what I see as their 'morning message' (aka the discussion topic for the day). 

This month's theme is family and friends, and when I went to work today, the message on the board in the three year old room was: 'Mothers and fathers take care of their children. Some families have no children.'

In centres where these children are surrounded by families with children and staff with children, they are actually making a point to tell these kids that some grown ups don't have kids and don't have to want to have kids and that's okay. I really love these centres and knowing that they're explaining this to the kids makes me extra love them. 

As well, because they'd been talking about that right before I arrived, the kids were, of course, asking if I had any children at home and were super excited to tell their teachers that I was one of those families.",childfree
Did it!!!,"So, I was getting fed up with the depo shot. I've gained 50 pounds in almost 6 years, so not good. I called my insurance a few months ago, and guess what? 100% covered tubal ligation. Dream come true. 

Today was the big day. Woke up at 5:30am, showered, pet the kitties, and rolled out at 7 to be there at 7:40. Filled out the tiny amount of paper work, basically saying I could be getting extra blood if needed, I'm getting anesthesia, yada yada yada. Go to the back, very first thing we do is a pregnancy test. Negative. So fucking duh haha. Got completely naked, except for my socks, then put on a hospital gown. The funny nurse asked me questions I had already answered, ya know, to be safe. Then she put in an IV for fluids, since I was dying of thirst. Hadn't been able to eat or drink since midnight. To prevent choking on your own vomit while you're under. Which sounds like a fun time, but I passed and followed the rules. The  anesthesiologist came in, talked to me about what she was going to do, and made me stick out my tounge, which still had my tounge ring in it, so oops. That came out promptly. Man, was I glad the tounge ring only said ""Daddies girl"" and not something like ""Fuck Me"" (my husband really likes the naughty ones haha). Rolled into the surgery room, they start messing with stuff, put an oxygen mask over my face, and I am out. That's the last thing I remember. Wake up back in the preop area, and one of the nurses is asking me how I feel, if I would like something to drink, or eat. I say I hurt, and that I most definitely would like crackers and coke (she gave me like so many options). My husband drove me this morning, but he wasn't in the preop area waiting for me, I guess they took him out after I was wheeled away. They brought him back after I was coherent enough to ask for him back though. They told me to watch for spotting, which, yeah, def got that. I'll take some spotting over kids. We totally got Arby's coming come (I highly recommend the s'mores shake and the beercheese sandwich!!). So now he's snoring in the other room, he took the next 4 days off to love and care for me. I've got idk how long until I can feel up to working, but today is a day of rest and bragging. 

I've talked about my mom and dad on here before. My mom actually offered to come to surgery with me today. She's really not happy I did it, but I guess she figured if I was gonna do it anyway, the least she could do was be supportive. Dad wanted to help too, and gave me some money to help cover the days I'll be off work, which is a huge load off our minds. I thanked them by offering mom cactuses. Apparently she's getting into them. My husband and I are now crazy cat people. We have 4 cats. Also a parrot. We just got two kittens on monday, and the little monsters are tearing up the place, but they settled down and haven't been jumping on my stomach today, thank whichever gods.

I'm really upset because my insurance won't cover sterlization/birth control,"I'm so upset right now. After years of getting ""No"" when asking doctors if I could get my tubes tied, I took a short hiatus from asking. This year I turned 27 and I decided I was going to go in an ask again, and hopefully now that I'm older they would allow it.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I found a doctor on the sidebar who works in my city and made an appointment. I decided to call my insurance to make sure they would cover the visit. That is when I found out that they will NOT cover any costs for a tubal or any sterilization, or birth control due to their religious beliefs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so upset. I'm sick of worrying month after month until I get my period that I'm pregnant. I use birth control but we all know that life finds a way. I would undoubtedly have an abortion if I got pregnant but why would I want to put myself through that when I could just get sterilized and not have to worry for the rest of my life. I work with a non-profit organization so I don't get paid that much either that I could just pay out of pocket. I really like my job so I can't just leave it for another one. I don't know what to do.

"The other side IS greener, but...","Basic backstory: I was raised in a typical, stable, middle-class family. My dad was a Navy officer and my mom was a stay-at-home-and-raise-the-kids-kinda. Sister is two years younger than me. By the time I was in high school, I knew I didn't want kids. I knew I didn't want a parasite getting in the way of my life. In fact, one of the greatest fears I had going into college was accidentally knocking someone up. You best believe I was on top of my condom game. The first time I had sex was the only time I didn't have a condom and afterwards I broke down in tears freaking out that I'd just fucked my life up. The girl was on good BC, so nothing came of it. I just wanted to use that example to highlight the point: I knew early that I didn't want kids.

Queue the typical response from family. ""You'll come around."" ""You'll change your mind."" ""Kids are the best!"" ""I can't wait to have grandkids!"" ""When are you going to get married and have kids?""

I'll be honest, this didn't last long. A few years after I graduated college, my parents got divorced. Then my mom died of brain cancer and my father died in a plane accident. My sister lives across the country from me and we're not close. I don't live near any of my extended family now.

Don't worry about consoling me though. It's been years and, I'll be honest, it's... freeing. Refreshing. I never have to worry about family reunions. I don't have to worry about the pressure of getting married, having kids, doing what everyone else does so I can be just as miserable as them. 

I saw how my parents relationship played out. They couldn't wait until my sister and I were out of college so they could split up. They were stuck with each other, miserable to the point of sleeping in rooms on opposite sides of the house, and all because of us kids. Without my sister and me, they could have split up as soon as they realized they were miserable, which, if memory serves, would have been around when I was 10, when they started talking about it and pretended like I was too young to understand what was going on.

Could you imagine? I admire their dedication, they did their best, but since then I've read therapy articles that claim it's better for the kids to just get divorced so you can show them how to be happy rather than how to tolerate being miserable. 

I won't make that same mistake, simply because I won't have kids, and I no longer have any of that family pressure. I surround myself with nerds that understand it, friends that may not agree with me, but know not to push the issue. Relationships built on mutual respect rather than this ""I know better than you because I'm normal and want kids!"" bs. 

So... yeah. It's awful because I'm still relatively young and don't have parents... but all of those expectations have been lifted off of my shoulders. I have nobody that I worry about pleasing or disappointing but myself, and most of my focus over the past five years has been improving myself, my mentality, my body, my career. Doing what I want to do rather than following a bad example that was set for me. 

If you have people in your life that aren't respecting your opinions and that push you into decisions you don't like, it's ok to leave those people behind. Your parents don't have to die like in my situation! But, it IS ok to pull away from toxicity like that. The other side IS greener when you don't have to worry about unwelcome pressure and expectations. 

This is just a different perspective that I wanted to share. I hope it helps?",childfree
Anyone else truly just freaked out by children?,"I adore my friends kids, they are beautiful and smart amazing little people and I feel a lot of love for them. But with that love comes an overwhelming fear and dread of anything happening to them.

Apparently sterilized means I might still want babies!,"I went to a new dermatologist today, and he recommended Accutane. Some of you may know about this iPledge bullshit, but it's new to me and I'm flabbergasted! 
I have to take two pregnancy tests a month apart, have my blood drawn, go over this stupid workbook, sign up on the iPledge website and let them know what kind of contraception I will be using (not my doctor, the iPledge organization or whatever wants to know), and go through ""contraceptive counseling"" before I can even get the medication. Then I still have to go in once per month for ""counseling""  and do more pregnancy tests and have blood drawn during the treatment.

Now I completely understand the doctor disclosing the side effects and emphasizing that a woman should not get pregnant while on the medication (though this whole ""program"" is still next level crazy). But did I mention that I'm sterilized? I've had a bilateral salpingectomy and an endometrial ablation and no longer have periods but I still have to jump through all these hoops! 

It's like they forget that abortion is an option. There is a 0% chance that I would ever consider carring a baby to term, deformed accidental fetus or not. So it literally does not matter even if I somehow got magically pregnant because I would abort the demon spawn without a second though.

She always replies with that I will change my mind when I get older (I'm 25, male). It's so infuriating that she keeps insisting that I will inevitably want to have kids. 

Why is the norm that everyone should have kids and why is it selfish if you don't want them? My parents have accepted and respect that if they want grandkids, it's gonna have to come from brother.

Poor families with a lot of children,"Probably this topic was brought into discussion several times, but I feel the need to express myself. I also hope that this is the sub that is suitable for this kind of rant (Posting from phone, sorry for formatting etc. etc.)

I am from a country where it is not particularly uncommon to hear about or watch news about extremely poor families with 8, 9, 10, 11 and so on children (Mostly in rural areas). What is well beyond my power of comprehension is why these families keep having children. Especially since they have so many, not one or two! I understand that contraceptive methods are not so widespread in the rural areas of my country, but when you know that having sex will result in a child being born, why don't you just restrain yourself? It's somebody else's life that is going to be miserable, extremely misreable, because you can't make a rational decision. This is not rocket science! I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that it is fairly easy to realise when you can't afford to raise a child! Maybe stop having children and use contraception?

Also, I may sound heartless, but when there is a fundraising for one family like this I just can't empathise with the parents. They say that they have a tough life, but it was their choice. They say that their children have a tough life, but it is their fault. They seek mercy, as if the situation has nothing to do with them. They are to blame.",childfree

I eventually told her I have too many health problems to have kids (which is true, but I shouldn’t have to bring it up) and she just didn’t say anything.

Pro tip to curate a child free ad experience on Facebook,"So, I'm sure I'm not the only one fighting an eternal war against advertising that's targeted towards parents, but still ends up in my feeds (because ""the algorithm"" thinks all women are crazy for babies or whatever).

BUT I just discovered there are much more efficient ways to avoid this, rather than saying no to the ads one by one. On Facebook, at least.

**METHOD 1: remove only select ""interests""**

To see the list of topics Facebook thinks interest you, go to your settings. The exact listing is slightly different depending on your platform. On desktop, it’s simply “Ads,” whereas on the app it’s “Ad Preferences.” Both serve you the same information.

Once you’re on the ad settings, you’re shown several lists. Each one represents a different way of seeing who’s advertising to you and how they’re in that category.

In each category, you can go through each of the things Facebook has determined you might like and remove it from the list, by hitting either the X or the ellipsis on its tile.

**METHOD 2: hide ""Parenting"" as a topic altogether**

Under ad settings (explained in method 1), choose ""Hide ad topics"" &gt; Parenting, and then for how long you want to set it for.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this tip can help some of you to a better, less peer-pressured online experience.It ain't much, but it's honest work. Cheers and have a nice weekend full of sleeping in and general comfort.

We aren't wrong when we state that parents don't want to bother parenting.,"I'm a first year junior high teacher with my first job after switching careers. At lunch today with the other teachers, including the kindergarten teacher, and the topic of kids coming to preschool and kindergarten not knowing the basics of just about anything came up. Kids that are 5 or 6 years old not knowing what a crayon is or not being able to hold a pencil/crayon because all they've ever known is touchscreen this or touchscreen that. Kids that aren't potty-trained or even know what a letter or a number is, as in the concept of letters and numbers are new to them. 

Basically the kindergarten teacher said that parents just don't want to bother parenting their kids anymore and don't do things like read to them or teach them how to zip up their jackets. Another teacher that has been here for 5 years commented that it wasn't even as bad as it is now vs. when she started. The kindergarten teacher commented that there are so many kids now with IEPs (Individualized Education Plans) that for a classroom of 12 kids the teacher is not going to need only one aide but two. Also, there is a physical therapist that is here everyday whereas they only used to come now and again. 

I understand that this is a small sample size, but the kindergarten teacher has been doing this for over 25 years, so I'll cede to her knowing what she's talking about. So, it isn't just us noticing how shitty parents are being in public with their uncontrollable crotch fruit, it also all ties in with how these parents pop out kids and then don't know or don't want to know what to do with them other than pop a screen in front of a kid's face at the earliest possible moment. 

Sorry for the long rant, I just wanted to share first-hand how some long-term educators have noticed the change in how parents parent, or don't, their kids. Cheers!

The doctor asked me if I wanted children and because of you guys I had the confidence to proclaim “No my husband and I are CF!”. Her response was “Oh that’s good!

Big bingo moment with mom and my retorts,"I brought up that if I were to ever EVER even have an inkling for raising children, I would adopt. This sparked the whole bingo spiel from my mom. Thankfully, a lot of roleplaying and imaginary conversations got me ready for this moment: 

But our genes (what's so special about our genes? you can rely on my siblings for that)

But a child is the physical embodiment of your love with your spouse (if I need a child to prove my love for my partner, there's something wrong with the relationship)

But you'll regret it (I already made up my mind)

But you're too young to make a decision (I'm older than you were when you had me)

What if your partner wants a kid? (then we'll part ways)

Wow that's so selfish (so is raping your spouse and forcing them to have kids to trap them in the relationship)

Who will take care of you when you're old? (nurses and doctors)

But there's no love there, and they can't be there 24/7 (kids aren't safety nets either)

But it'll cost you money to have those caretakers (yeah, and they'll know what the fuck they're doing. Also, I'll most likely have the money to afford it)

You don't know that (well, I know I would be saving about a million dollars by not having kids, so hopefully I spend that wisely)

So you won't take care of me when I get old? (I'm saying that if the only reason I had kids was to force them to take care of me when I'm old, that's a stupid reason to do so) [in my mind: no, and am hoping one of my siblings steps up to do it instead because I don't want to]

Don't cheat yourself out of having children (you're only saying that because your whole life has been about taking care of people. That's the only lifestyle you know)

You won't live a fulfilling life (there's research done that addresses this. People can find the same level of fulfillment in alternative methods, like mentoring or having a high impact on the greater good of society)

Those will never compare to raising children (again, we've been your whole life, so that's the only fulfillment you've accomplished in life and thus the only one you know)

Then she got mad at me and just retorted that I'm too young to make this decision and went silent afterwards lol

Why I’m pretty certain on being CF,"I realized I probably didn’t want kids when I was a teenager. Pregnancy disgusted me, not only physically, but socially. Everyone coos at you and treats you like you’re this helpless MAWWWMMYYY and it’s just disgusting. I hate being treated that way, and the thought of being infantilized for 9 months sounds terrible.

I’ve also dealt with an eating disorder for years now. I don’t think I could mentally handle gaining weight. And not the short term weight gain, but the long term stretching that comes with pregnancy. Losing control over my body and permanently damaging it sounds traumatic and like a life course to misery. Not to mention, increasing my risk of prolapse. I want a functioning, healthy vagina that is capable of pleasure and sex. I don’t want any damage done to it - ever. And it doesn’t even take vaginal birth, either. Just the extra weight, the stretching, the relaxin, and hormonal changes can alter your body forever. Fuck that. 

Shallow shit aside, if there was a single word to describe me, it would be student. I want to learn, all of the time. Whether it is structured in college, or sitting home watching crash course, I need to learn. Kids at my house that aren’t even mine disrupt this, I can’t imagine what caring for my own child would do to my free time and passions. How can I focus on what I want to do dedicate my life to, my future career in political science, with a financially burdening and time consuming human that is reliant on me for everything? My long term boyfriend is on the same page. We’d no longer be able to just take a drive to the beach, smoke a joint, or play basketball together at midnight for fun. We’d be so limited. We’re struggling financially as young kids trying to make it. The thought of getting out of college, earning a livable wage, and then ruining that progress and increase in living standard by taking on an extremely expensive child sounds so disheartening. 

I also think of my mom. It’s been 20 years and she still has to help me with taxes, life advice, and sometimes with car repairs if I can’t cover it all. I love the lady, but shit, I wouldn’t want to be stuck with that for decades. I can’t wait to repay her for everything she’s done for me. She also sends me condoms and always emphasizes that she loves having *granddogs* rather than kids, so no pressure from her. 

Lastly, I don’t think I have the temperament. I want to have complex conversations, and I cannot tolerate when kids freak out over the stupidest shit, like refusing to drink out of a specific cup, or throwing a fit over other illogical shit. It’s just annoying and idk how parents deal with it. I wouldn’t have the patience to tolerate the pickiness and feed into it to get them to stop. I also don’t know what the fuck I would do if I ended up having a kids with special needs/disability. I know that sounds evil but it terrifies me. I couldn’t handle it. E",childfree

RE: Doctor not giving proper care because women gotta have kids, you know?","Context posts here: [1 Rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/csrkya/rant_personal_doctor_not_giving_proper_care/) , [2 Rave](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/d7yhv3/update_re_doctor_not_giving_proper_care_because/)

A couple weeks I updated on this story with a rave about my new doctor, after the first one I went to BINGO'd me and refused to help me with my pain because I was ""too young."" I was asked to provide an update after my procedure was done, so here it is!

This new doctor is absolutely amazing - and YES, I have added him to the CF-Friendly Doctor list ;-). I had surgery yesterday, and he found the source of my pain: lots of Endometriosis, as he and I both suspected. He surgically cut it all out, and I am now recovering. He also YEETED MY TUBES without ANY trouble at all! He just double-checked ""So you are sure about your tubes?"" to which I said YES, and he nodded and said ""alright then we'll get that taken care of too!""

My incisions hurt pretty bad and I'm still nauseous from the surgery yesterday, but finally after many years of struggling and pain, I finally have some hope! AND to top it all off, I can proudly say I am OFFICIALLY totally Childfree FOREVER! (Well... unless my dog counts, she's basically my baby anyway! ;-) ) No more fighting about birth control, no more having to deal with ""But you're only 23!"", no more having to deal with ""Well, just take some ibuprofen for your pain if you don't want BC!""

Please don't give up looking for a doctor that will help you! Especially if any of you out there are suffering with endometriosis or are suspecting it! That pain is real, and it sucks! And who knows too, maybe your doctor will help with your sterilization at the same time like mine did. Do not let a BINGOing doctor block you from the care you deserve- you are a hell of a lot more than a baby machine! YOU come first before any hypothetical children! Don't let a doctor try to convince you or treat you otherwise!

Now I am off to write a wonderful review for my new doc... because he really rocked! I've never felt so listened to and VALIDATED... with both my pain AND my lifestyle!",childfree
Downvoted for telling the truth about how children kill the environment,"I frequently browse a popular judgement sub, and OP had posted that they bought their niece very nice fancy clothes from a thrift store for their birthday - keep in mind, this is a young child so they grow fast, and clothes quickly need to be replaced. However, the parents were pissed, saying their daughter only wears ""clean new"" clothes (the clothes *were* clean, there was nothing wrong with them, they were a little pricey original actually). 

I told OP that I supported them because the child's still getting a nice gift and it's helping the environment, and I said more people should thrift if they can because it reduces waste. Me, along with everyone else who shared similar opinion, were downvoted to hell. I just can't see how breeders can justify fulling up landfills with mountains of plastic baby garbage because their precious child is """"too good"""" for thrifted clothes, give me a break. 

I don't see how plain facts can be considered controversial, but maybe you guys can share your similar stories with me because I'm interested on this.

EDIT: Not sure if you'll all see this, but your tales of thrifting make me so happy! I'm a huge fan and I just love giving life to something that I've found in a consignment store. I love thinking of the story behind it. It's a unique thrill - and even better, good for the environment! You are all sadly right when you say that it's because parents are afraid of anything that criticizes them. I think they should be willing to accept it and change in order to help better the future. The video someone posted below was awfully scary (but also sadly true), and I think we have a lot to change about the perceptions of kids growing up to beneficial for the environment (let's be real, kids probably aren't going to grow up to be an envi scientist, so now they're just doing more harm than good).",childfree
Need support,"I don't know where to post this and I'm not really in a good place rn so any support is appreciated. Also English is not my first language and I'm on mobile. 

I'm a CF 22F. Back in May I'd gotten pregnant due to a sheer streak of bad luck inspite of doing everything correct. Then I miscarried but my health took a turn for the worse since that pregnancy. My boyfriend was incredibly supportive of me through everything. 

Now again I'm afraid that I've become pregnant. It's very unlikely because I'd sex in the middle of my periods and I was far from my ovulation date. Also I've a very regular menstrual cycle and I can always count on it. 

I'm heavily nauseous to almost all food and certain smells. I'm having headache and counting today my periods is 4 days late. It maybe due to the reason that I'm extremely stressed and my mental health is not in a good place. Also I'm suffering from food poisoning, which might be the reason for nausea. 

But I've no one to support me now. My boyfriend is going through a bad psychotic breakdown and has broken up with me and is talking to someone else, or so he said. Now the problem is he does this when he's not in his right mind because he has 0 idea what he is actually doing and I can only feel sympathy for him. I know in his right mind he'd never hurt me like this. But I'm stressed, alone, heartbroken, in a really bad mental state.

Also I can't do a pregnancy test now and I've to wait for a minimum of 4 more days because I'm at home. I'm feeling lost. If I'm pregnant I'll have an abortion right away but I'm so fucking lonely.",childfree
On the fence but should decide,"Hey friends. In the last year, I’ve come to terms with the thought that maybe kids just aren’t for me. I’ve told all my parents (complicated family) who absolutely adore the idea of grand babies, and they were all really supportive of my feelings. 

But in the last couple of months, I have met someone. He is PASSIONATE about kids. He’s a few months younger than me at 22. He’s clearly told me “if I could afford to have a baby right now, I would.” I love this guy, unconditionally; and I have been in the spot before where although the idea scared me, having kids with someone I loved that much would be worth it. We’ve touched on the agreement that it’s much to early to talk about it seriously, but I know that eventually I’m going to have to decide if I want to compromise or not. 

It’s not the physical making and delivering a baby that scares me; that was actually the most attractive part in my fantasy last time. I think it’s just what to do with them after that seems daunting. I don’t trust myself to raise a kid properly, though I was raised with exceptional love and care and know how to do so. I realize it’s a whole life commitment that I just don’t know if I’m ready for. 

Weighing in is welcome, though I realize I’m gonna get a lot more insight as to why not. Thanks!",childfree
Funny (because it's true) Captain Obvious CF commercial,"I saw this funny hotels dot com TV ad last night and immediately thought of this sub.

Contraceptives with malaria pills question,"So I'm quitting my job and bumming around Central America for three months this winter, because no kids+no mortgage=why not? I went to the health department for malaria pills, and they gave me a prescription for doxycycline. The nurse at the DH said that doxycycline may render my contraceptive pills ineffective, so of course I freaked out a little (my boyfriend will be joining me on my travels for a few weeks and obviously we want to have a good time, if you know what I mean). I googled it, and fairly reputable websites like drugs.com and healthline say that doxycyline (and most other antibiotics) shouldn't affect my contraceptives at all. They cite some research, but most of the citation sources are behind paywalls. 

So do I trust the nurse at the HD or the citation of resources I can't actually read? Has anyone had experience with this before? Abortion is either highly restricted or completely illegal in the countries I'm going to be in, so I really, really don't want to get pregnant.",childfree

I've started practicing admitting my cf status to friends and coworkers,"So, the title pretty much sums it up. My long term boyfriend (our 6 year anniversary is this month! Been going strong since 2013 despite a lot of long distance) and I are both adamantly child-free. While we've both deflected the typical ""bayyybiesss"" conversation with our parents/family for a while now, we haven't come right out and clearly stated that we will NOT be having children. We know the guilt trips and possible rudeness that would ensue and aren't ready to deal with it.

So I've started practicing on my friends and co-workers to gauge the typical life-scripter reactions. So far, I've found that it's been received fairly well. Even from my coworkers that already have children!! And the one thing that's shocked me: not one of them has asked ""but why???"". A few have asked how my boyfriend feels about it, and immediately reply ""oh, ok! That's good!"" when I let them know that we've discussed it at length and are on the same page!! I always feel the need to justify myself when I mention I don't want kids. I'll talk about how I have a family history of complications during and after, and my personal issues, both physical and mental. 

I feel sort of bad, though. I absolutely adore my parents and I know how much they both love children. I know how much they'd love my children. Especially since I'm the only one of their three kids with a SO currently, I feel like a lot of pressure is on me to get married and pop out kids for them. But I won't. The thought of carrying and birthing a child literally disgusts me. I don't like kids. Especially babies, their cries literally piss me off. Even as a kid, I wouldn't play with other kids because they annoyed me so much. I would never want to have a kid and have them live their lives with a mother who obviously barely tolerates them. 

So, cf-ers, what advice can you give me on how to let my parents down easy?",childfree
Those who want to be parents should seriously ask themselves if they have what it takes to be one.," 

A lot of people say that parenthood is the most difficult job in the world. And perhaps they're right. Raising a child and making her/him a productive member of society is a challenging task that require a certain skill set and certain personality traits. And if one is lacking in any of these skills and/or personality trait, then one should not become a parent.

Before you enter parenthood, ask yourself if you would be willing to accept a child who is LGBTQ+/ develops a value system that's distinctly different from yours/ refuses to follow your religion/refuses to follow in your footsteps/falls in love with someone you can't connect or get along with etc. If the answer is ""no"" for any of these scenarios, then please, either work on becoming more accepting or don't become a parent. Often we get to hear heartbreaking stories about parents turning their backs on their kids because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or due to religious differences. Your child is an individual, not an extension of yourself. Please do not treat her/him as such.

Will you be able to raise a disabled child, or a child with a genetic/neurological/mental disorder? And don't tell yourself that this can never happen to you. Ask yourself if you, as a parent, will be able to provide this child with what she/he needs.

Ask yourself if you will be able to provide for a child's material needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, toys etc. I know this may sound elitist to some. But intentionally bringing a child into poverty, just because *you* wanted someone to call you ""mommy"" or ""daddy"" is cruel and selfish.

If you happen to pass away, before your child reaches adulthood, is there someone who will be able and willing to raise her/him well?

What are your reasons for wanting children? Do you truly want to nurture a human life? Or are you afraid you'll have no one to care for you when you're old? Or do you just want someone who will carry forward your family name? Or, even worse, is it because you think parenthood is for everyone and is inevitable? All of these reasons, except having a desire to raise a child, are selfish and illogical.

Last, but definitely not the least, do you have the infinite amount of patience that parenthood requires? Are you sure that you won't snap under stress and do something that would hurt your child?

For those of you wondering if I have children, no I do not nor do I plan to have any. But there was a time in my childhood when my father couldn't be there for me and I was being raised by people who had *no business* raising a child. I was the unwanted child, the unloved child, the child who was seen as a burden. And no child deserves to be in a situation like that.",childfree
Why CF is for me,"This is a great community!  I relate to so many of the posts.  Thought I'd chime in my 2 cents.  

I'm a mental health counselor.  I feel good about what I do: helping people gain insight into what is troubling them, and helping them make positive changes.  But that requires me to have a lot of emotional resources!  I often come home a bit of an empty husk and I need time to recover.  I really need a quiet evening to recharge so I can keep doing what I like doing!  

I don't believe I would have the emotional energy to focus on the people I work with day-to-day on top of raising a child.  If I had a kid my focus would be that kid and I'd have way less patience and empathy.

My goal is to leave this world a bit better than the way I found it.  I'm able to achieve that much more effectively without having a kid!",childfree
Asked my doctor for a vasectomy and got my sanity questioned. [23M],"He was condescending from the moment I brought up my desire to have a vasectomy. The whole time he maintained that he was neutral on the subject too. Thankfully he agreed to send me to a urologist in the end where I will also likely be subjected to my life choices being heavily questioned. 

It still amazes me that it’s socially acceptable to question the sanity of someone who doesn't want to birth new person into a world on the brink of environmental collapse at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars and 18+ years of their life.",childfree

Interested in being child free..?,"Im 19. Still young I guess. Idk if this type of post is allowed but I’m conflicted with myself.

I’ve been thinking about this for a while I grew up not wanting kids ever and if I did I would adopt cause it just seems wrong to bring life when there is already a ton of life but living shitty. I’m also a person who’s afraid of about just anything if I give it too much I can make myself scared. So I’m scared of getting and being pregnant. I don’t want to have to go through hospitals or any of the conditions women go through when pregnant.

Although a part of me also may want a kid just one of my own. As much as I am scared, and want to adopt. I still may want to experience it just at a later date who knows. As someone who would also consider adopting, I obviously wouldn’t put my baby for up for adoption.

I hate children and I tend to hate people interactions. But idk I love my family, best friend, and pets.

Too Early for This Shit,"One wall of my bathroom is also the exterior wall of my apartment complex so occasionally I can hear whatever is going on in the hallway. Hooray for paper thin walls.

At 6:45 this morning as I was doing my hair for work, the sound of a wailing  toddler could be heard for a good solid 5 minutes. I could hear the mom telling the kid to come on, but evidently the kid was just throwing a tantrum and the mom was just letting it happen. At 6:45 am. In the hallway of our building that amplifies all sounds.

My friend asked me to engage more with her child...,"... and I feel like it's threatening our friendship.

Long story short: I'm a teacher, I'm happily childfree by choice, I love working with children but whenever I spend my freetime with friends, I really don't want to be an entertainer for children.

More detailed: I love my friend but her life is shitty. Her husband doesn't give a fuck about her quality of life, she has to do all the housework, all the cooking and all the care for the child, she usually has next to zero freetime and he gives her very little money so a babysitter is no option (he has a lot of money). Kindergarten here is only 3.5h a day (which is ridiculous, I know) and during that time I'm working, so whenever we see each other he's always there.

Her child is 4yo and probably the most hyperactive child I've seen (and as an elementary school teacher, I've seen a lot). He's not well behaved at all, he doesn't accept any rules and he does everything to get attention. So whenever we see each other and try to talk to each other, he freaks out. 

So yesterday she told me, that her child behaves so much better with friends who entertain him, play with him, talk to him... I mean sure - makes sense. But even a 4yo should be ok with playing for himself for 30min so his mom can have a talk with her friend. And I really don't visit her to spend time with her child... It's not that I'm mean to him or ignore him, I just pay very little attention to him and want to keep it like that.",childfree
Breast cancer and sterilization,"I have an aunt visiting who's had breast cancer this past year and is recovering. We were talking about period cramps and how much of a nuisance they can be when I mentioned I'll be looking into sterilization soon, both because I suffer too much with period related problems and for the fact that I don't want children. 

Instead of bingoing me, or even giving me a strange look, she mentioned I should tell doctors that I'm related to someone who's had breast cancer and that it should help me get the surgery done, due to the risk of having it in the future. 

Now, I've researched about it a bit, and I didn't find anything that connects tubal ligation, hysterectomy or salpingectomy to a decrease in the risks of breast cancer; so I would like to know if anyone in this sub has had a similar experience and if it affected the process of getting a sterilization surgery in any way.

Thanks in advance.",childfree
All the good reasons,"We were a couple for 5 years and he knew I didn't want kids but I knew he wanted kids for the bestest of bestest of reasons of all bestest of reasons out there: ""My surname/bloodline would end if I didn't have any children"" Duh, right?

Nah he was a great guy at the time and didn't pressure me or anything. I knew he was a bit of a pushover so what I wanted was all that mattered and he wouldn't even try to have a word in anything (which was also the reason why it didn't work out in the end but that's another story).

There was one particular conversation I wanted to share because it seems funny to me.

I was listing all the reasons why I didn't want any kids, chronologically in the order of supposed appearance.

""First there's morning sickness. And sooo many other things that can go wrong in the pregnancy. My body would 100% develop pregnancy neurodermatitis, I just know it. Then there's birth. You have seen Alien, right? This. Either down my fun zone or out of my belly. Don't know what I would find less shitty. And if it's down my fun zone sex will be like throwing a salami in a hallway after that. Then comes the constant crying. Babys need attention 24/7. All of the time. When they do sleep, it's never for a long time and I would have to clean up stuff in that time because everything would be super messy around the house all the time. After some time they begin to crawl and then they reach things. You'd have to put them all up where they cannot reach and/or just accept that you won't own nice (or clean) things for the next \~ 5 years. And the stuff they wear through. Buy something, dress the kid one or two times and throw it out because the kid has grown out of it. So expensive and wasteful but from what I've heard it's not acceptable to dress your kid in potato sacks and just adjust the belt while they are growing. Then there are other people who tell you what to do because obviously they know better, right? Who talk in this diabetes-inducing super sweet voice to the child. Then school begins. All your effords to raise an unbroken, decent human being are kicked out the window. Because now it has to learn to fit into society. Then you'd actually have to push your child out of its persona because otherwise it won't be a human being that will be accepted by society. Otherwise it gets bullied. It will get bullied anyways, probably. You'd have to be part of the whole fucking shit-show and you'd have to do this to the little thing you love because thank God there are hormones that make you love them. And then you see how stupid teenagers are. You know by then how stupid kids are but teenagers? A whole new level! And sooo lazy. Ugh and smelly If you have a boy, prepare to double the amount of frozen pizza and tissues in the house and pretend you don't know where they go. And at this point the kid will take all your effort and self-sacrifice and throw it out the window with a gigantic Fuck you(TM) and I hate you(TM). If you're lucky you did some things right and they will maybe come to their senses when they are in their late 20ies and can guess how much of an ass circus raising them must have been...""

That wasn't even everything I said and I know there are tons of other bothersome things and reasons and yes I do focus on all the bad things (but to be honest, not a lot of good things come to mind. Enlighten me if you know of some other than the at-least-hormones-make-you-love-them.)... but he interrupted me by laughing very hard. He just found it funny how I could ramble on and on about the reasons why I didn't want any kids. And the topic was never brought up again...",childfree

Sick cat makes me realize (one more time) how miserable I'd be as a father.,"So my cat, Darwin, has been sick lately. He couldn't pee so he was very uncomfortable.  Luckily it wasn't hard to fix his problem, but he still isn't quite alright, he doesn't have appetite and has been depressed this week. To make sure he is ok I had to stay at home more, be there for him and try to help him. I had to postpone some things, my usual sports, my hobbies, and I even had to suspend a date with someone I was excited to date, *sigh*. I love my cat but I can't say I wasn't annoyed for all of this inconvenience. I also expended a lot more money that wasn't in the budget in fixing his problem (bummer).

With all this I can say I'd be the worst father ever: I've got so stressed out by a cat's welfare, what would I do for a kid? How much more money and time would that mean? It would be the end of my life. And if you are miserable, how can you be a good parent and role model? It's just impossible. I'm so happy I'm snipped and I'm so shocked about how many people choose parenthood.

Screeching from 7am every day,"I just wanted a quick rant:

So I've booked into this lovely guesthouse in Phnom Penh (Cambodia).  It's in a great location and it's super cheap, a great place for me to base myself while exploring.  The downside?  The neighbors have a kid that just won't shut the hell up and the sound of his constant wailing just works its way right into my room.

Unfortunately I'm not sure I can do anything about this, I have the only air conditioned room and I have work to do on my laptop which generates extra heat which would become unbearable in a fan only room.  My saving grace is my noise cancelling headphones but they're uncomfortable to nap in.  Oh well, first world problems I suppose.

The child seems to take pleasure in screaming and wailing in new and interesting ways.  Honestly, I thought he was being hit at one point but no, I looked out of the window and he was just running into walls while wailing.  Seems to love just making noise.  His older friend (sister?) has been silent in comparison, I didn't know there were two kids until I looked.

Thanks for the support,"Hey everyone,
I am a 30F and just wanted to say you guys helped me realise I don't need to please anyone but myself. Since 16 I have felt I don't want children but thought I might change my mind one day (as everyone said it would happen). I have never felt maternal and have had a disconnect with children my whole life. I've been with my partner for 11yrs (husband for 1yr) and have felt the pressure from family and society to have children for many years. I have had ups, downs and battles in my mind about what feels right for me and what society would be happy with. I have moderate depression and anxiety so I know that I need to look out for myself but also have the feeling I need to please people and family in order to make the 'world' right.

My colleague who sits next to me is pregnant and while I am happy for her, people take the opportunity to ask me when I am going to have kids. Since being part of this thread I see I am not alone anymore and I am confident to say ""no thank you, my ovaries are closed!"".

Bingoed by my husband at dinner,"Was just out getting dinner at the local fish and chip shop with my husband. While waiting for our food, a mum and her 2 kids show up(8M and 6F), who proceed to run and jump around the small, crowded shop, ruining my good mood. They then go outside and play hide and seek up and down the street outside of all the closed businesses, one of them nearly getting hit by a cyclist riding on the pathway. The mother didn't even notice until my husband pointed it out. Not to mention that this is on main road and one of the kids could have easily run in to traffic.
Anyway, I was getting visually annoyed at the children and turned my chair away because they were right next to us. My husband then asks ""So, when do you want one?"" I blurted out ""Never!"" a little too quick for his liking apparently.
I then said ""I'm serious. I don't want kids."" He then said the following, with me replying no to each.
""You'll change you're mind once you've lost all your weight"" (I had weight loss surgery a month ago)
""We'll adopt.""
""We'll get a surrogate.""
""You cant let your family line end with you?""
To this I said, ""Both my brother's have kids. I don't need to worry about that.""
He laughed the whole thing off then said, ""I'll knock you out or something. Put a hole in one of the condoms."" 
I was fucking mortified! I'm really fucking pissed off because he won't take me seriously. When we got together I was a fence sitter, but over the last few years I've struggled A LOT with depression and I've decided I don't want kids anymore because I don't want to pass anything on. 

 I truly believe this will end my marriage.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your support, it means a lot. I do want to clarify that my husband and I have a very sarcastic and fun relationship. We take the piss out of each other daily and can laugh about it. We have all the same morals and so much in common. Except for this.

Edit 2: I have researched the cost of divorce in my country and it's not as bad as I thought. I have seriously been considering it since reading everyone's replies. It's helped me a lot. It's just really upsetting because we are actually very well matched, but the no kids thing is just something he won't be able to get past.
He would say he's ok with it to make me happy, but he'd end up resenting me. If I had a baby, I would resent both of them and either leave them or end up killing myself. Dramatic, yes. But I have seriously thought about it. It would ruin me.",childfree

Breeder agenda on talk show,"This has been on my mind for a while, so I'm gonna post a little rant here 'cos you guys are great listeners.

Where I am there's a lighthearted current events talk show that runs most weeknights after the news. Mostly they just go back over new stories, talk to politicians and celebrities, run human interest stories, and banter. But over my time watching it I've noticed they've got a very strong breeder agenda.

Almost every week there's at least one parenting story; the prime minister having a kid, stay at home dads, and tonight it was a touring heavy metal singer who was also a single mother. (The one about the stay at home dads particularly annoyed me even as a CF person. Two guys were featured on the show and praised endlessly for doing something that a lot of women do every damn day).

At one point a whole week was devoted to babies. Carseats, couples doing IVF, so on. One night they interviewed three childless women. The first two were very sad, but a shout-out to the third woman; she was able to say, quite happily, that she'd never regretted not being able to have kids. It was the only bearable part of that week's shows.

This kind of thing makes me feel a little hopeless that being CF is ever going to be destigmatized. The culture is so pervasive, and so supported. (Like when a celebrity has kids all anyone can talk about is their kids, but when they don't that choice is just kind of ignored; I was very surprised to find out how many famous women are CF).

Anyway, that's my little blurb over.",childfree
Brats invading a college campus during peak class hours,"I was spending my nice, quiet gap between classes enjoying my lunch and catching up on some homework. It was like the calm before the storm - out of nowhere, I hear a terribly cry ""KEEP TO THE RIGHT OF THE SIDEWALK!,"" followed by endless shrieky voices. I look out the library window to see a menacing caterpillar-esque line of brightly clothed toddlers clogging up our only main sidewalk used to get to all the main class buildings. Peppered amongst the rowdy students, they wreaked havoc and caused major transportation delays, as their awful screams bounced off the building walls and echoed throughout campus. How wonderful to have such a loud nuisance on campus during peak midterms week! /s

- End Scene - 

But seriously, who the fuck thinks it's a good idea to pile toddlers/young children onto a bus and take them to a college campus? They don't know what they're doing, they can't even recognize what it is. There's nothing pretty to look at either, just bland gray architecture. *I* don't even want to be here sometimes, but I do enjoy my education so far. 

It's beyond me why having a field trip to the most boring place imaginable (for children) was suggested. They cause immense foot-and-road traffic (we already have car congestion as it is, we certainly don't need those god-awful cheese busses everywhere), and they make us late to class because they clog up all the sidewalks like chicken bones in a garbage disposal. And all of this during midterms week - just why???",childfree
Doomed to a sad sex life..,"        (Apologies for mobile blah blah) Today I received the most direct bingo I have in a very long time. It was from a 16 year old girl who is otherwise very sweet and agreeable, but whose parents are very strict and very religious. To the point where I was discussing Endgame with another coworker and mentioned how sad I was about Tony's death, and this girl genuinely thought someone I knew had died because she had no idea who Iron Man was. She can't watch anything comic book related, definitely no Harry Potter or LoTR, nothing, and her work schedule availability was submitted by her parents, with notes about her 3 different church obligations each week. 
        So tonight, I was discussing the Nexplanon implant vs IUDs with another coworker, and this girl piped up with, ""I just don't see why anyone would want to be on birth control!"" 
    "".....Because I don't want to have kids."" 
    ""Well then you shouldn't be having sex because sex only exists so you can have kids!"" 
       Good lord, girl. I just shook my head at her and said ""No, no. Having kids is optional, not mandatory. It's okay to have sex because you want to."" and made some excuse to go get something from the walk-in to get away from her. Of course it was frustrating, because, well, mind yo own vag, but the more I think about it hours later, I just feel bad for the girl. Her view on sex will just be, 'it's something to endure/put up with so I can have kids and fulfill my role as a woman.' Sex is amazing. Not only physically but being intimate with someone you love makes you feel that much closer to them, and if she ever finds herself enjoying it, I hate to think of her first reaction being guilt or shame. I really hope she gets some freedom and has a chance to open up her mind, because she's so young to be brainwashed into this shit, and she really is a sweet girl.
 But damn, thank fuck for birth control.",childfree
Yay! I'm Spayed!,"So I've been childfree forever and I have a bad time with hormonal birth control, and I also developed a fun (not) condition called endometriosis when I switched hormonal birth control because the progesterone was making me depressed. I got my doctor to agree to take my uterus and ovaries and replace their hormones with hormone replacement so those levels can be stabilized and adjusted as needed. Now I'm FOR SURE CF forever, and I'm not longer in pain. Also, I apparently have had endometriosis a long time, and every doctor I saw before mine was an asshole. The bingo winner suggestion was ""That's not so bad. If you don't want periods, get pregnant!"" My husband nearly put that asshole through a wall.  I hope one day someone makes it their life's work to follow that man around a week out of the month and throw blood on his pants and kick him in the balls, tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

My nurse also told me she's also childfree! Look at us, we're everywhere!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, for those curious about it (outpatient surgery):

\- I had it done laparoscopically (4 TEENY incisions for tools and a camera to go in to look.

\- Your belly gets blown up with special gas to move the organs around, you may experience back and shoulder pain when you wake up. I've got a bad shoulder AND a bad back and I honestly don't feel it now, almost 24hrs since my operation.

\- Your uterus is kinda, uh, reduced in size to fit through the hole. Don't look it up, just don't.

\- Since it was a laparoscopic procedure, I was out the same day. (If you're in CO and need an endo/PCOS/fibroids specialist, lemme know)

\- I was told I'd be back on my feet and working in 14 days or less. However, I'm already writing this from my computer in my loft at home, so I'm doing pretty well currently!

\- You also don't remember shit after about 15-20 minutes before your operation. You wake up like ""Whoa how did I get here? We were JUST talking in my room!""

Tips:

\- Get up and move, doctors often fill your abdomen with gas to see organs better, so walk (WITH ASSISTANCE) as soon as you are able to.

\- The hospital wants a few things to release you most times: you eat something small and keep it down, you can urinate on your own, you can walk with some assistance, and most importantly - your pain is under control. Speak up, don't suffer in silence because you want to be tough, you're your own best advocate.

\- Ask for extra nausea meds.  A LOT of people throw up surgery day, at least a couple times. That's cause they didn't say ""Oh hey, sometimes pain meds make me throw up, can we adjust for that?"" or ""I'm already really nauseous, I think I should be given a lot of anti-nausea stuff just in case.""

\- Tell them if you're freaking out. They will give you drugs and ask you to visualize yourself somewhere. This is when you're gonna pass out, by the way. You'll be asleep before you're in the OR most times or in my case, I entirely forgot if I got there awake or not! 

\- Comfy pants are your friend. The surgery center will likely give you panties and a pad, use those panties and make sure you have loose, cheap panties you don't care for while recovering, you may bleed, especially if your cervix was left in place.

\- You'll be OK! It's scary. Even if you're only getting tubes tied or an IUD placed, I feel ya. Please feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to! Gynos TERRIFY me, but now I've done the hardest thing. If this wimp can do it, you can too! I hope this provided even a tiny bit of reassurance for anyone wondering wtf goes on in outpatient surgery.

If your blood is not oxygenating well enough to be sent home, a nurse can help with that. What got me from borderline ""don't discharge this person"" to good was having the nurse walk me around, If you have a procedure with gas, ALWAYS get a good walk in every hour, even if it's a stroll to the fridge.",childfree
How have you guys coped with your close friend having baby?,"Throwaway since she has Reddit.

I don't know if I should break my friendship off with her. We are both very young but I have a hard time making friends and now she's pregnant. May seem selfish but I always thought we would have more time to do things people our age do but now it is all going to change. Everything will be different and I'm not sure what I want to do and how to feel about the situation. I want nothing to do with babies and pregnancy but if she stays in my life that's what her life will be about forever. No more hanging out at 1 am. She has a baby. Can't stay out too long. Gotta take care of the baby. Baby has to come with us to the mall because she'll have no one to watch it. Can't go out of town for ny 21st birthday because she'll be heavily pregnant. What do I do? And if I decide to stay friends how do I cope?",childfree
Update: I got the abortion!,"I am in some pain but I wanna thank you guys so much for giving me tips and kind words, you don't know how much they made me feel better throughout the process. I also wanna give /u/bjenaan_reborn a quick shoutout for calling me a murder in my private messages - you gave me a chuckle! 

I told management I'm going to need a couple days off of work and they gave me my sick time no problem, and I reached out to a friend whose driving down here from out of town and she's gonna hang out with me and watch movies while I cuddle with my cats. Again, I want to thank everyone in this sub so much for being probably the most welcoming group of people I've come across on this god forsaken site, and I also want to specifically thank the mods for having my back and removing negative comments before I had the chance to see them.

My family has always been weird about me not wanting children,"I have openly expressed it to my family since I was about 14 and now I'm 21,my mom still tells me ""you might change your mind someday"". my religious old grandmother tells me my purpose as a woman is to reproduce. My sister gets mad at me because I don't coo and do all the baby stuff with her 2 month old,acts like I'm going to be some bitchy detached aunt who doesn't care about her niece. when we're at holiday things and there are children present and I awkwardly say hi or try to get them to leave me alone,someone has to publicly announce ""SHE DOESN'T LIKE CHILDREN OH I KNOW HAHAHAH"" and everyone laughs for some reason? not sure why it's funny but y'know. I sincerely don't understand why my family treats me this way,like the black sheep because I don't care to have kids. I've told them I can barely take care of myself (due to bad depression/anxiety) I couldn't possibly take care of a child,and I'd never want to put someone in a situation like that. plus I just don't want them!! I want to live my life and not have to worry about kids.Someday I will die alone with my cats,and that will be a life fulfilled

Did your favorite TV characters having kids ruin them for you?,"Because it did for me, I adored agent Scully in the X-Files, smart, sassy, gorgeous, a role model. Seven seasons they danced around her being barren and I thought maybe she’d stay child free... nope knocked her up. Ruined the character and the show for me. Next was Temperance Brennan, I thought if anyone would stay child free it would be her.. nope. My last hope was Olivia benson I’m a huge fan of the show and then what does she do.. adopt a kid. The kid ruined the show and the character. Anyone else get frustrated when their favorite characters have a baby or end up with a kid?",childfree
Reasons why I don't have kids,"Edited 

1. I both like and hate kids...
2. I SAW HOW THE YOUNGER ONES HANDLE PETS! ):&lt;
3. Only ways I'll stay up late is to watch porn and dirty anime or write stories and fanfics
4. I would only share my snacks with people who asked politely or when I feel like sharing...

10. Songs for babies sucked!
11. I can't stand screams, yells or cries!!! NOT EVER!!!
12. I have anger issues that sometimes things get out of hand...
13. I have a mental problem; it's mild but I'm not taking chances
14. Too many kids in foster care and adoption systems
15. Overpopulation; USA and Mexico have more than enough children for the countries
16. I don't have a job and even if I do I want to keep the money for myself and to donate to charities like WWF or activist organizations like Girls Not Brides
17. It appears that some relatives have reproductive issues; My mom miscarried a few times and so did my aunt while the child of that aunt is premature and she still has some health problems... I did not want to suffer like them! I CAN'T even handle a paper cut!
18. I've been the oldest of my siblings and I don't think I was a good role model

Edited: 24. I collect fragile nice things like glass mythical creatures or porcelain eggs",childfree
"Store I work at has sign asking children to be supervised, but we welcome dogs","I work at a popular store where we sell a bunch of cute things (plushies, stickers, pins, notebooks, mugs, jewelry, etc) and we’ve had to ask children to leave several times if they’re not with their parents or if they’re being rowdy (kids once threw Cheetos everywhere; kid rides scooter in store; kids touch all the fragile items). We once had a mother watch as her toddler put a plastic cupcake keychain in his mouth and then put it back with the rest. She didn’t apologize or say anything to us about it. We’re generally weary about kids being in the store. 
But a couple times a week, owners will bring in their dogs on a leash. Never once have dogs jumped on, bit, or broke anything. They are all very good and we ask their owners if we could pet them. One dog even came in wearing orange shoes! They’re so much better behaved than children.",childfree
How many Americans here are CF because of costs and political uncertainty? Is that not truly child free?,"I know there many reasons not to have kids in other, more humane societies where the costs are not absurd and the future not quite as bleak as it is here, including global warming, etc etc.

I just ended a long term relationship over children after a lot of thought about the financial realities and how I wouldn't want to morally subject to what I predict the future will be here (I'm a policy analyst and spend lots of time making these predictions).

That said, in a Scandinavian country, I could see having 1 child, still reducing the overall population. So I'm not completely philosophically against it, more pragmatically.",childfree
I feel like I only see negative posts about the copper IUD,"So a few months ago I had to switch to an IUD because I was diagnosed with epilepsy. BCPs would mix with my medication, and a pregnancy could be dangerous. (Plus I never want kids).
Insertion was rough. But the next day I felt fine. All month I felt fine. Normal period. And again for the next month. And the next.

I love it. I feel totally fine. But whenever I read about it, like on reddit everything is ""iud failed me"" ""positive pregnancy test"" ""this is giving me horrible pain and periods""

He’s vasectomized I’m on IUD and we always knew we didn’t want kids even before we got together, there was never drama about it

HOWEVER a few weeks ago I was telling him about a friend of mine who needed a abortion

He said yeah I don’t support that and I was what?? I thought you were child-free

He said I \*am\* child-free, I don’t want kids so I prevent it

I asked you know those things have a significant failure rate right?

He said that’s why we overlap two methods

I asked so what would happen if we had an accident and I got pregnant?

He said he would take care of me during the pregnancy then we’d give it to adoption!

I have a terrible phobia of pregnancy so I got really mad at him and said it’s not that simple and it would be so much worse to ruin the kid’s life with rejection to never have it

He changed the subject and didn’t apologize

Today the subject came up again and he let me know that he’s anti-choice because of religion… that life is sacred and has a meaning 

He always seemed like the rational type to me. I was quite disappointed. I don’t mind him having a spiritual side as long as it don’t affect the real world important issues

We started discussing again and I asked him what if I was raped? You think you could just take care of me and make me not only give birth but give birth to something this disgusting?

He was quiet for a while then just said I won’t be raped because he will always protect me

I’m so mad. This may be a deal breaker for me. I know this sub probably has men who are truly committed with not breeding, but to most men being child-free means only spreading their stupid genes then walking away. What he suggested me was simply that I walk away with him too. I’m crying with anger now",childfree
I had a reaffirmation of being child free today.,"The last few weeks, I’d had thoughts of maybe wanting children and being a dad. I was rethinking a lot of stuff.

Annoying, but not unreasonable given what else I’ve seen in the job. Then, I noticed something foul on the air. 

This kid had SHIT IN HIS PANTS. And yeah, toddlers shit themselves and that’s normal, but I shouldn’t have to deal with it, and I definitely don’t want to deal with it in my personal life.

I even pay my taxes so your dumplings can not be dunces when they get that job taking care of me in the nursing home.

So, can you do me one damned favor?  Let the kids board the bus without having a speech prepared for the bus driver every morning?  Just let the kid get on the bus and stop making all of us late for work.  Trust me, your kid doesn't appreciate you getting on the bus and embarrassing them either.

So, to the same asshats that flap their gums at the drivers every morning:  ""SHUT UP!""  Your kids are not the center of the universe.  I can see the bus driver's eyes rolling at 100 yards.

We then made our way to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier which is a tomb for all of those who were unable to be recognized. It’s guarded 24/7, 365 days a year in any weather. My family and I made it to the tomb right as the moment of changing of the guard. 

It was dead quiet and very very interesting to watch. The guards were so still and silent. So why the fuck would you bring a baby to a cemetery? Why on earth would anyone need to hear a child babbling during this kind of ceremony. I was baffled. What the fuck. It seems rude. The hell???

The other ramble comes from the trip to the zoo. I love the zoo. However my least favorite part of the zoo is the inevitable chance to run into children. The strollers blocking the roads the kids making screeching noises. Small children trying to slip under the railings that are there specifically to keep people away from the cages and then crying loudly like a fucking banshee when scolded. Ugh I hate it. There was so many loud obnoxious kids bobbing around who would bump into my legs and shit which pissed me off. Screeching and being overly loud. Not having any sense of personal space or awareness.

\---

TODAY, 06 OCTOBER 2019 AT 13h33 LOCAL TIME, I FINALLY UNDESRSTOOD WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME ...

I'm 26 Male, and :

* I had a difficult teen period (late primary school , in middle shcool and high school) having constantly issues with class mates.
* I constantly had (and i'm still having) communication issues with my parents (80% with dad and 20% with mom) since primary school
* After going to the university, I noticed that something was wrong, and the constant feeling of mental pain wasn't something ordinary.
* while being a student, I've had the a chance to find a person, and we dated for several months, was the first time I ""loved"" somebody and it felt amazing, unfortunately we couldn't stay together and we broke up, and it was painful for me...
* And now being an employee with a salary income, as I entered the adulthood for about 1 year and a half, wasn't prepared for such a change, from being ""a student and do volunteering work"" to becoming an ""adult""

As I went to the University, I started to invest into my mental health by reading books about psychology, watching videos on YouTube about self development, tried periodicaly reflect in depth about my life, tried all sort of possible ways in order to ""understand what's wrong""

And finally, today, I realized what was going on :

&gt;**It's my dad's fault all along these hard years**

My father's story:

* My dad was raised in a poor family, having 1 brother and 6 other sisters ( there were also other siblings that died after birth unfortunately)
* Being poor, gave the children of the familly the willpower to study well, in order to get a job and start making money in order to satisfy the desires they lacked when they were young.
* My father had ( and still has ) a mindset, where he quote it in a phrase like :

&gt;Your worth, is based on how much you earn...

I've understood what he meant, considering his background back where he was a child. My father strived (and still strive) to make money, and invest it into buying food and goods for us, And **I really, really appreciate** his ""material and financial"" investment in us.

Thus, being money ,food and goods oriented, he completely lacked understanding in a life axis called "" the mental "".

After several years of, me, researching about mental health and personal development :

* Starting from school days where I had issues with classmates
* Meanwhile, got beaten up mentally by my dad - because he couldn't and still can't understand the existence of a second ""the mental"" axis of life
* Surviving until the University ( and yes because I had suicidal thoughts ), where I finally realized that my mental health was deformed throught several years. So I started my quest into understanding and trying to fix my mental issues ( later on, after 2 to 3 years, I've decided that : **becoming morraly, mentally and emotionally stronger - is my life's vision** )
* While being a student, I had the chance to - first of it's kind - ""love"" a person, dated her for 11 months, I can proudly say that the first 5 months were ( and still I guess ) the best period I've experienced in my entire life so far, I felt alive,and felt being loved-back, I felt also that I was overflooded with energy ( love energy I guess ) and believed at that point that *life is worth to be lived* ... unfortunately, from month 5 to 11 things started to mess up, and we ended up braking up (breaking up with somebody you've experienced - for the first time - real love with, isn't easy at all ... ). That experience made me question romantic relationships, and created in me a huge self-doubt when it comes to relationships...
* After graduating, I had also a hard times because I was jobless and I've got a lot of pressure from my parents
* Arriving to this last year where I could finally get a job, and surprisingly my parents (kind of) left me alone mentally ( because I finally became useful by starting to gain money, according to them )
* Having this last full year of (kind of) peace of mind, I invested intensively into improving my mental health and personal development.

Until today,  
I've finally dug enough,  
I've finally saw the light throught the fog,  
I've found the exit from the maze where I was stuck for so long !  
and came to **colnclusion that : the source of all my troubles, was my dad's fault.**

I finally realized that, during the past years, and with a lot of research in the field of psychology and mental health, that I was experiencing ""manipulative acts"" from my dad, as I assume that it's his educative way to raise me.

I'm going to go throught some of the acts and behaviors, I judge, were ""manipulative"" that I've undergone :

* Assuming that a fulfilling life consists of 2 main axis which are :

1. the material and financial axis
2. the mental axis

* for a scale from 1 to 10, a fulfilling life (based on these two axis, where none of them can be neglected ), is about 8/10 9/10 and ideally 10/10
* Living in an environment materially and financially fulfilled, but not mentally fulfilled, makes you rate it 4/10 5/10 or 6/10, this implies that you are going to complain about the environment (because you are a child and you rely 100% percent on parents) in order to make the environment better (8/10 minimum), so when confronting to a parent who doesn't believe in the mental part, will surely not understand and acusses you of being needy, but worst of all, he's going to threaten you buy degrading the material and financial parts, to make you live in a 2/10 or 3/10 environment, to make you suffer and make you understand that (it's better for you to live in 5/10 environment and being grateful, rather than in a 2/10 environment)
* Beat you up mentally by enrolling you into fake problems, and make it difficult for you to concentrate on real ones, this will imply you to not be as effective in life and constantly being late in your ""life living"", and ... **accusing YOU for your fails and ineffectiveness,** that you are the one and the only responsible for creating fake problems and being stuck in them while others (and yes, my parents often used to compare me with others that are progressing in life). The bottom line here is to beat you up mentally and accuse you of being **THE** responsible ( by the way I recently went throught a paragraph in a book called \[10 strategies for mass manipulation by Noam Chomsky\] and guess what was one of the strategies ?

&gt;... Another strategy of mass manipulation is to make people believe that they are solely responsible for their problems ...

I was shocked when I read that strategy, as I concluded it by my self earlier and that I wrote it down in my journal.

* Another manipulative way ( somehow similar to the first one ) is to control you materialy and financialy when there are desagreements, a lot of conflicts had ended up with my parents banning me to take the car, or to have money, or to have acces to to the PC, or to the internet connexion or to go out somewhere with my friends... etc, even if these material and financial ressources weren't directly linked to the original conflict.
* Another one, beat you up mentally sooooo bad, that's going to break many of your personality traits, for instance, make you lose the ability to ""argue /repost"" by constantly controlling you, this is going to affect you in interpersonal communication with others, so anytime you got confronted to somebody outside, you are more likely to loose the argument and surender, even if you are right, because you feel broken and don't know what is it about to ""win an argument when you are right""
* Comparing , or deny comparison of a parent with you , **when it suits him**  

   * comaprison example : the parent says : look how I'm doing X and Y and i'm responsible, and not you, being lazy and not responsible, you should take me and what I do as an example
   * deny comparison example : the parent says : oh, you are little with no experience, I'm older than you, i have more experience, you can't compare yourself to me
* constantly asking to do things, to become this and that, and often it happens that the parents ask me ""to be and to not be at the same time"" , for instance :  

   * mom saw me a bit overweighted (then she says to me : you should train)
   * mom speaks with her friend about an immigration plan ( she says : you should search and apply for an immigration procedure)
   * mom talks with another friend about work ( she says : you should apply for a new better job that pays Z amount)
   * just few days ago a residential plan in order to acquire a basement came out in the country ( where you pay each period a partial amount of money) and in the conditions to apply, the applicant should have a salary between X and Y amount ( my dad says : since you are between X and Y you should apply)
   * and many others ... it's too much demands, over my capacity, the worst is that there are conflicting demands ! ... that i'm supposed to fulfill all of them right now ... so irritating ... and capable of making me collapse
* I'm sure I experienced other manipulative acts, but unfortunately I can't remember them all :/

I'm sure that my parents are very likely not conciouss about these actions and the bad consequences that hit my mental health ( I want to believe that it's the case, and not the done consciously)

Of course I tried to talk to them and make them aware about the mental axis in the life and its importance, but senior's mindset is hard or even impossible to change

I don't want to say it, but I think that my parents just don't know what they were ( and are ) doing, they are just following the flow, act and make decisions on the spot without enough reflection ...

Back to the topic, Like I said, my father influenced me a lot in my childhood, teenage years and still influences me right now, those bad experiences made my personalty weak, which is unfortunately not optimized mentally ( I suffer from overthinking, lack of self-esteem, self-confidence and self-doubt when dealing with people or romantic relationships, I used to have suicidal thoughts, i find it hard being in the present (in the moment) and I often day dream (visualizing past events or thinking a lot about the future)

Because of the mental suffering I'm experiencing, I believe that *Life is not worth living*, but *I* want to be wrong on this so bad ...

I hope that in the near future, i can afford to live in a separate basement, where I no longer experience being mentally bullied for things out of my control.

TODAY, I SPENT 4 CONSECUTIVE HOURS TO WRITE DOWN THIS POST, TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY STORY, AND HOPEFULLY HELP SOMEONE TO RECOGNISE ANY OF HIS ISSUES, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I DID IT FOR MYSELF.

Worst job interview? spoiler -the interviewer breast fed her baby nearly the whole time.,"I will add a caveat first up that I don't have a problem with women breast feeding in front of me. No issues with boob's or bubs getting there feed on. In fact I would prefer mums got on with it before the baby starts crying.

But. 

I practiced employment law and applied for a position in a bigger law firm.  At the start of the interview the interviewer had their baby on there lap making lots of noise rattling toys and chirping away. Fine, no problems. Then it started crying loudly,  and she just asked questions over the top of the crying, and I shouted my answers back.  There was another girl in the room taking notes, she offered to take the baby out or let her go out and she would continue asking the questions. The interviewer said no need, and opens her shirt unclips her bra (all the while still asking me questions) and then proceeds to start to try to breastfeed. The baby kept stopping and crying. I maintained eye contact, ignored the baby and answered the questions. I did see the milk slobber sprayed in the direction of the girl taking notes. But I kept smiling and answering questions about my experience preparing appeals to the Supreme Court while the girl wiped her milky gift up. 

Finally the baby settled and she covered the baby (with a really nice blue scarf sadly going to be ruined by baby milk spit) while it kept feeding. I felt like saying too late lady I've practically seen the kitchen, chef and dinner plate.  

 I think yes back to focussing on the interview. But then she starts rocking the baby back and forth in weird jerky motions which were more distracting than the baby. 

I don't want mums to be discriminated against based on family responsibilities. If this work place welcomes bringing bubs into work okay, keep them away from me (especially when sick) , but your work life balance arrangements and what you do in your office is fine. However, when I am trying focus and push down nerves and give my best answers to be the successful candidate, please excuse yourself to feed and jerk your baby about in another fucking room. Then come back and continue the interview once the bub is settled. I felt it was really unprofessional and I can't imagine what clients thought if she was taking her baby to client meetings.  

After all that I did get short listed, it was between me and someone else and they asked us to come back for second interview. I had been offered another job so I was like thanks for the opportunity but no thanks.",childfree
Endo ablation: orgasms post-op?!,"Hello!

I’ve decided to go the endometrial ablation route and after reading a bunch of posts from various internet people, I’m curious about your sex lives after the procedure/recovery. As someone who squirts (and my partner enjoys that), has anyone found that their orgasms/libido changed after the procedure/recovery?

Thanks y’all!!",childfree
I don’t want OR need my uterus. It hasn’t functioned correctly in years and causes me one of the biggest inconveniences in my life. (TMI warning),"All my life, I never seriously wanted kids. The most fun thing about it to me would be naming them and dressing them up, but of course I never thought those were good enough reasons to put myself through parenthood. I became more firm in my CF views as I’ve gotten older and bingoed more frequently. 

I’m a 26 year old virgin. I’ve never seen a gyno, and only really talked about my reproductive health with my mom and close girlfriends. To the TMI part- basically my periods are wildly unpredictable and a major nuisance. They haven’t been regular since I was a teenager, and honestly I can’t really tell most of the time whether I’m having my period or the frequent random spotting I get in between periods. Which means I’m often wearing pads on a daily basis, much longer than I should be. On the other hand, sometimes I won’t get any periods or spotting for a couple of months, as if I were pregnant. If I got into a sexual relationship with my reproductive system still intact, I’d be paranoid all the time that I’m pregnant, since I can’t rely on my crazy cycle to let me know. 

The more certain I’ve become in being CF, the more annoyed I am with the fact that I even have to keep this useless baby and blood- producing machine inside me. My mom has told me my irregularity is because of things like stress, iron deficiency, and (slight) weight changes. And one of my friends thinks getting a hysterectomy would mess me up hormonally and doesn’t think I should even get a bi-salp (she’s def a future mombie). I don’t care. I don’t care for uterus-saving solutions. And I was never taught from a medical standpoint that your uterus has as drastic an effect on your hormones as your ovaries do. I’d be keeping my ovaries, at least. 

I would just LOVE for my body to reflect what I want to do, or not do, with my life. I don’t want to be held back from going swimming because of a bodily function that will never serve me in any way. I’ll never be held back in life because of parenthood, so why should I be held back due to my uterus, which seems to have a mind of its own? It’s senseless. 

I already know which doctor(s) I’ll be contacting from that wonderful list for at least a bi-salp. I’d just love to know if there’s any possibility, any reason you have to believe that any doctor would consider doing a hysterectomy on a seemingly healthy 26 year old, whose period problems likely have benign causes, just because she wants this pointless nuisance out of her life and never wants to be a mother anyway. Thanks in advance.",childfree
Sitcoms,"Are sitcoms secretly anti-children propaganda? So many revolve around or consistently have the storyline about the stress and/or burden of having kids.

Telling the parents...,"Hello childfree lovelies! I can't even begin to describe how much relief this sub has brought me. I've even started looking forward to getting my tubes tied.

My only problem (like a lot of you, I suspect) is how I'm going to let my parents know about it. Not ask, because it's not something they get to decide, but inform them that this is something I'm doing to my body.

I ask this because I've already gotten semi-bingoed by my dad. He's already joking about my sister (18F) and me (21F) pushing him around in a wheelchair and about my theoretical kids talking to ""grandpa"". That's so weird to write out. I have corrected him in the past when he said ""when you (I) have kids"" with ""IF I have kids"", but that was before I found y'all. My mom has been more open about it, saying things about if my sister and I have kids, but I still don't know how she'll react when I tell her this. I'm actually afraid, and I feel like they'd bingo me hard if I told them.

So! tl;dr - how do I broach not wanting to have kids/permanently ensuring I don't have kids with my parents?",childfree

"""You'll be miserable in your old age""","Whew. Really didn't expect this convo with my Aunt. 

My Aunt has 2 kids of her own and she seems pretty open about how hard it is and how all of her free time is gone and whatnot. When me and my sister went to visit her one time, she essentially used us as free baby-sitters. I didnt complain since we got to stay there for free and got meals and whatnot. But I do remember getting no help in the way of discipline whenever her kids would fight or anything and I was too uncomfortable to tell them to knock it off. I also distinclty remember feeling like my soul was evaporating every time I had to fake interest in whatever they were talking about, or fake laugh at their jokes. Really solidified the not wanting kids mindset for me.

Anyway my point is that she seems to not really enjoy being a mother. She is a very good mother and has well-behaved kids, but she pretty much says, ""I used to be happier. Now i'm not"" without outright saying that

So guess how surprised I was when the topic of kids comes up with her at a family vacation and I mention how I dont want any and she starts telling me how miserable i'm gonna be in life. Talking about these ""studies"" she's read that imply couples without kids are happier at first but then as they get older their happiness declines. While couples with kids are less happy at first but then become happier than the former. 

I made a ""you serious right now?"" Kinda face and said, ""Iiiii kinda doubt that."" To which she replies, ""No really! Because when you're old with no kids you have nothing to look forward to!""

...seriously? There are absolutely so many things you can do in this life: travelling, learning new skills/hobbies, reading, being part of various social groups, THE LIST GOES ON!! If I decide i have nothing left to do by 50 then honestly its my own fault for being sad. Plus i'd much rather be happier with more free time before my body starts failing me anyway. Im willing to bet that when she starts getting happier again it will directly correlate with the fact that her kids are out of the house!",childfree
Can’t get a handle on your kids...,"I do community service at an animal shelter on the weekends. Most of the time I just mind my business, do what I need to do. People come in and look at the animals. Of course, those with kids try treat it like a petting zoo even though visitors are not supposed to touch them. Anyway, I was making my way to the kennels when I see this woman with 4 kids. Two of them looked to be around 10ish, she had one on her hip and a toddler. She seemed more transfixed on looking at dogs rather than the fact that her toddler was jamming his fingers in the fences. Whatever. Not my problem.

I go to take one of the dogs on a walk and everything goes smoothly until I arrive back at the shelter. I have to cross a parking lot to get through the back gates to the kennels, and usually I let people pass because at the time I was walking a lovely doberman and didn’t want people to be intimidated. Well, luckily for me, here comes the woman I had seen earlier with two huskies on leashes.

I’m not allowed to let the dog I have interact with other humans or animals, mostly for safety reasons, and mostly because I don’t know how they’ll react. As soon as my dog saw the huskies, she started pulling on the leash, growling, and she was pretty strong so it was hard for me to hold on to her. And of course this lady is taking her sweet ass time crossing the parking lot. Her toddler is trailing behind, nearly walking into a street full of busy traffic, and she hasn’t a care in the world. Meanwhile, my arms are hurting and I’m worried that I’m hurting my dog by pulling her back.

But she continues to take her sweet ass time crossing the parking lot, stopping every couple of steps to call out for her toddler who wandered away. It took her about 5 excruciatingly long minutes before she got the whole circus loaded up into her truck.

15 Weeks Paternity Leave is Excessive,"I work with a staff of mostly young professionals, so pregnancies are a rare occurrence. One of our director level staff announces he has a baby on the way with his wife. We didn’t really have a parental leave policy outside of FMLA. Just before the kid is due to be born, my job announces a 15 week parental leave policy. Fully paid salary for 15 weeks - both maternity and paternity. Seriously? Isn’t this a bit much? He doesn’t even have to pop out the kid. It seems like they are catering to him and his situation. Must be nice. They say they’re all about “equity” in the workplace. Where’s the equity for those who have made a different life choice? Can I get a 15 week sabbatical to travel the world? Probably not. I’m ok with reasonable parental leave, but this seems detrimental to a small organization’s finances and the staff who have to cover for nearly 4 months. Most progressives think that more parental leave is better for society as a whole, but at what point is it too much? Should society be making it easier or harder for people to have kids? As you can see, I struggle with this question.",childfree
I am the strawman childfree person that people use to bash childfree people,"We've all heard it. If this sub is mentioned anywhere outside of the sub itself it's met with a wave of comments saying that this sub is full of hateful vindictive child-haters. Then there's the response wave of defenders trying to reassure the general public that we're not like that at all. And that's a good thing. It's good that we aren't the horrible monsters that people like to say we are. But on the other hand...

I am that monster.

I hate children. I hate them with literally every molecule in my body. I'm not out here drop kicking toddlers or insulting parents to their face but my mind burns with hellfire whenever they're around. I'm physically repulsed by just about every aspect of children under 6 and annoyed by every aspect of kids under like 16. I hate the sound of babies screaming almost as much as I hate their laughs. Every sound they make pierces my brain and makes me want them gone.

I'm bitter and vindictive towards parents. If your kid is doing anything other than sitting quietly then I'm probably thinking about how you're a shitty parent. Yes of course I know that parenting is hard and I can't reasonably expect kids to always be as docile and well trained as service animals, but none of those facts can really stop me from being pissed at you for your kid inconveniencing me.

I'm selfish. I'm unsympathetic. I don't have a ""real reason"" to not want kids. That's the biggest bullshit to me. That so many of us have to justify our choice by saying all the ways our own parents fucked us up. But that's not me. I don't have an ""excuse"". My childhood was fucking fine and I have a good relationship with my parents. Why? Because they knew they wanted two kids, had their two kids and were stable enough to care for us, and never did anything to make us feel like an unwanted burden even when they've been divorced and lived in different cities since I was a little kid. Nothing ever happened to me that made me think ""I don't want kids because I'll fuck them up"". I just straight up do not want them. And you know what? That's fucking fine.

We don't have to justify our decisions. We don't need to feel guilty for not wanting the traditional life. To everyone who says that people on this subreddit are bitter, vindictive, child-haters I say you're right. I'm here. I'm here and I hate you and your kid and I don't want to see your photos or hear about your ""miracle baby"" or tell you that your toddler looks like anything other than a slimy sticky bag of shit. I especially don't want your kid shoehorned into conversations that have absolutely nothing to do with kids. I'm here. I exist. I hate children. Die mad about it.

Edit: wow I did not expect this level of positive response to this lol. Glad to know I'm not the only person who doesn't think we need an explanation for our perfectly valid life decisions

"""Only moms should be allowed to take Halloween off!""","Some context; my job allows you to request time off a month in advance.  They always push you to ask further out so they have more time to find coverage.  Days requested are first come, first serve. We are required to work all holidays except Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Other holidays are usually requested way earlier in the year so later requests are denied.  Holidays are usually requested at *least* 6 months in advance. 

A few of my coworkers were all discussing their Halloween plans with their children today.  They  were complaining about not being able to take their children out because they'd been scheduled to work in the evening and had been denied their request.  The conversation took a turn I should've expected but I was surprised regardless.  One of the women was significantly more upset than the others and told the group; 

""I requested Halloween off two months ago and they didn't give it to me. I was going to take my kids to a pumpkin patch! They gave the day off to Mike and he doesn't even fucking have kids!  He's going to go out and get drunk while my kids cry at home.  Only moms here should be allowed to have Halloween off, we have kids to take out!"" 

All of these women agreed very loudly and kept ranting with her about other holidays and how it's wrong to not prioritize women with children over people who ""just want to party.""  The most ironic part of this is that I've heard the main woman brag about how, ""she only likes being a mom on holidays"" because she gets the day off.  Then she's pissed off because she doesn't get Halloween off and I have a hunch that it's nothing to do with her kids.  I guess you don't get to enjoy holidays if you don't have children.",childfree

My kitten made me realize what a shit mother I'd be.,"I got a kitten. She is small and cute and looks like she has a masquerade mask.

I plopped her onto my bed and left the bigger cat in the other room, me and Valkyrie (the kitten) cuddled up together and slept. 

Day two she peed on my bed. I cried and thought she was actively trying to disrespect me. I can't bring myself to *punish* her because it makes me sad to see things suffer even a little bit. I'm only used to fish. So my boyfriend, who is very nurturing by nature, litterbox trained her and taught her not to bite. I did my best but I'm just...weak. I tried but I could never go all the way. I think I have some unaddressed issues. And now the big cat takes care of her most of the time.

Talk to me about having your tubes tied,"Last month I got to spend the night in the hospital following an ER visit.  Turns out I had (still do) multiple pulmonary embolisms.  Given my age (29F) and other health stats the only likely culprit was my hormonal birth control. 

So, estrogen birth control is a no-go for me now. 

I had the copper IUD previously, 3-4 years back, and it was simply awful. I had it removed after a year.  

As such, I feel honestly angry that my other BC options are so drastically limited.  Non-hormonal birth control is primarily condoms or various forms of them.  They break, I've seen them break, I don't have faith in them. 

My partner refuses a vasectomy and frankly, I don't know if we are lifelong partners. 

So, mentally, where this all leaves me is with one solid, definitive solution, having my tubes tied.

Is it possible to get a hysterectomy for mental health reasons?,"I have really bad tokophobia, meaning I’m not just absolutely terrified of pregnancy and anything related to it,but am also completely appalled by my own reproductive organs. I take the pill everyday with out breaks to suppress my   period (last one was at 3 years ago), because I mentally and physically just cannot handle it, as in, I used to genuinely think about suicide during and after every single time I Menstruated, for 6 years straight, from my first period at the age of 9, and the last one when I was 15 and started to take the pill. 
I always thought I would grow out of it, but I didn’t. I still get really dizzy and nauseous when I even THINK about the existence of my ovaries &amp; uterus, or just not even my own,just that the female reproductive system is a thing that exists. Over the last few months I regularly had the ever so slighest pain in my ovaries, because of an hormone imbalance (don’t worry I got that checked), and legit threw up several times after I felt it, sometimes even a day or two afterwards, because I couldn’t just forget about it, because it made me remember that I am, infact, a woman with a intact reproductive system. 
My question is, if this would be reason to maybe get a evaluation from a psychiatrist to maybe get an hysterectomy or sterilization at my age (18 rn)? Because I don’t think I can handle this for another 15-20 years, which otherwise would be the absolute earliest any doctor perfom this surgery on me otherwise, since I don’t intend to get married, and children, adopted or otherwise, are a hard no.

Paid Parental Leave- is it fair?,"Just got a memo from my university that employees will be eligible for paid parental leave now. It's:

1. Eight (8) weeks of paid parental leave to eligible employees who have given birth to a child, and
2. Four (4) weeks of paid parental leave for eligible non-birth parents, as well as for adoptions, foster placement, or other legal placement of a child

I am really on the fence about how fair these policies are to people who won't or can't have children.  It's one of the items our politicians are waving around to gain support and it's like yes, of course they should have time off to recover and bond w/ the new child and reorganize their life an all that, and it's no cake walk.  But that's 4 or 8 weeks of work (and likely they'll use vacation and sick leave as well to extend that time another 4-8 weeks) that doesn't get done.  It's not an illness they're suddenly struck with- they can choose whether or not to have kids these days. 

I think it would be more fair if this also included people who needed to take care of ailing relatives, but it's worded for parents only. Family illness leave is part of the sick leave we get.

"dear nephew, thanks for being a great reminder","of why i never, ever want kids.

Im 19, still living with my mother. My half sisters are 10 and 8 years older than me, so the oldest has started a family. her son is two and a half, and he visits every week, for about a day and a half. Let’s just say that i do not enjoy dinner with him, since he throws almost everything out of his mouth. And we have to manipulate him into even grabbing a bite (“oh no! not my food. no way you’re gonna take a bite of my food!” it works sometimes)

also, when we take his toy away cause he’s not eating, he starts screaming and crying. For me and my boyfriend, this is a great reminder to never have any gremlins of our own. not to mention how much money kids costs, and how you’ll barely have any time off for the first few years.

I make it sound like i hate my nephew, which i don’t, i just don’t like kids. And i could never deal with this like day in day out, thanks but no thanks. &amp; thanks for reading my little rant lmao",childfree
Have my TL surgery scheduled for next Friday. Thank you all for helping me figure out how to speak to my doctor and finally be heard.,"I wanted to thank everyone here for their stories about tubal ligation and for helping me to figure out how to speak to my doctor about wanting permanent birth control. I found a doctor who heard my voice.

I am excited and nervous about the procedure as I haven’t had surgery for a while, but I have the support of my loved ones to help me out. 

I am happy to be able to take the control of my body that I’ve wanted for a long time and to do this for myself. You all helped me feel like my decision is important and should be taken seriously.  

If anyone has any advice that will help me to be more comfortable after my surgery then I will gladly take it. 

Thank you again everyone. :)",childfree
My cat kept me up all night last night.,"I moved to a new apartment yesterday with my cat, Kiki (instagram: @sweetmisskiki, because I can't access imgur at work and reddit doesn't like me linking Instagram posts; you can also go back through my post history to see her).

Everything was fine in the beginning. I got her and brought her over about 11 am, she hid under the couch for a minute but came out, explored, sniffed, played with her spooky house, got in her cat tree, everything was fine! We went to bed about 10:30, and she went around to explore. 

At 1:44 am (I checked my watch), she started crying. 

*And she didn't stop.*

MEWW. MEWWWW. MEWWWWWWWW. Just, non-stop. I petted her, I played with her, my boyfriend and I both held her, but she wouldn't stop! So I have been awake since 1:44 this morning (boyfriend did fall asleep through the mews at one point, because I heard him snoring), and it's now 10:30 am and I am dying. 

I've called the vet, I've crowdsourced possible reasons online, and everyone has said the same thing: she's just anxious because it's a new place and you need to get nightlights because it's scarier at dark than it is in the daytime. I just can't. I can't imagine being up with a screaming baby all night like this. And this is only one night. Everyone says it's going to get better in a day or two, but I can't imagine this going on for months or even years at a time (my sister was a terrible child). 

I'm so thankful this cat is the only brat I'm ever going to have, because I would not be able to function on as little sleep as I got last night for months/years at a time.",childfree

The first question Vogue editor Anna Wintour asked Rihanna in her interview: “Will you have a baby soon?”,"Visibly uncomfortable, Rihanna replies: “Um, I don’t think about stuff like that....I look forward to all the pregnancy rumors after this interview.”

Seriously, why does popular media have such insane baby fever? How is it “okay” to force motherhood on somebody who very clearly doesn’t want to take part in it? Rihanna is a very empowered, successful woman—but of course that isn’t enough. None of that matters if she doesn’t pop out a “little miracle” soon.

How come when a celebrity gets pregnant, it’s the talk of the whole world for 9 months (*cough* Beyoncé, Cardi B, Kylie Jenner)? Of course after the kid is born, people stop caring. It’s as if the whole world just has a pregnancy fetish and women exist solely as a host for fetal parasite after fetal parasite after fetal parasite.

Turned down an offer on a nice house because there was also a family interested. Should i have done this?,"Hey there,
So me and my partner live in an small apartment with my cat. my cat is not able to go outside, and we have ‘just’ 40 square meters on the third floor. Small, but cozy and really nice. It’s what we call a ‘social house’ which is built by the government and not expensive to rent at all.

I am subscribed to seek for other social houses.  Person who responds to the advert and is subscribed the longest, gets the house. I have been subscribed for 6 years, mostly it costs about 8 years to find a nice house in my area.

I responded on this advert for a pretty nice house in a good neighborhood, still pretty close to the city centre. The house was 120 square meters, with a garden, which is a LOT for dutch standards, and the rent was about the same as we pay now.

When we went to see the house, people who were on the list 2nd and 3rd were also there, in case i wanted to reject the house hey could give it to he 2nd or 3rd on the list. I really liked he house.. it was big, with 4 bedrooms and a garden for my cat. however, there was a cute turkish family, who were second on the list. They had 3 kids, one very small baby. They were really excited about the house. They seemed to really be in need of a suitable place to live.

What went through my head was... i want to turn the house down so they can live here, BUT.... it’s their choice to have kids and not preparing well enough for that.. Also, I really liked the house and i could imagine myself living there! We ended up turning the house down, mainly because i felt like this family deserved it more than we did.

I still wonder if i am weird for doing this, as i have been looking for a nice place for 6 years and we were lucky to get this one. Still i visualize this family, happy with their new home and it makes me feel warm inside.

What would you have done?

TL:DR: got an offer on a nice cheap house,- chance that does not come by often. Turned the house down because there was a family with 3 small kids second on the list to be accepted.

Parent VS Breeder: Juxtaposed Mothers at the Airport,"Hey. I am currently at an Airport, about to board. I just noticed two similar yet distinctly different mothers and I found it interesting enough to share with you. 

The first mother I saw was rather young. Late to mid twenties I think. She had a toddler with her- I have never been good at telling kid's ages, though. Anyhow, she was walking to the gate with him and he was lagging behind. She stopped and reached for her son. He squealed and turned away from her, waddling in the opposite direction.

Instead of chasing after him or calling him or freaking out she merely shrugged and went ""okay"" then kept walking. The kid squeaked again and quickly ran after her. I think he just wanted to be more independent, which is understandable considering that most mothers expect their little boy to hold their hands and follow them everywhere like a puppy. 

Mom number two had an infant strapped to her chest and a toddler about the same age, if not a bit older. She was also about the same age as mom number one. Her kid did the exact same thing. He toddled off in another direction away from her.

Mom number two called out to him. He did not come. She rushed over to grab his hand. He probably thought it was some new game and ran away from her resulting in a small chase around the airport (he wasnt very fast). 

I just wanted to share this distinction between parent and breeder because too many people don't seem to grasp the subject. The funny thing is, both moms will be on my flight (hence the juxtaposition). The parent mother has a MUCH more vocal kid than the breeder mother. But she is doing quite a good job at keeping him quiet, not by plopping an iPad in his lap to shut him up. I'm not sure... I do know that this will be an interesting flight.

Edit: Update. Breeder mom's baby is screaming its lungs out. Parent mom's kid is as quiet as a mouse... which does entail the occasional squeaking. 😂",childfree

Why should the ability to care for a child be a litmus test for functionality as an adult???,"I was reading the replies to this post where people were basically saying - about a 20 something guy who was expected to take care of a kid out of nowhere - that if a person who is childfree doesn't know how to take care of a child's basic needs and/or doesn't learn how to do this, they're not a functioning adult. 

I mean fuck as a 20 something I do know how to take care of kids because I nanny/babysit, but I don't have my shit together at all. And I know that childcare is my side hustle, not the thing I want to do with my life in any permanent capacity. I like kids but don't want to pass on my genetic material and would rather spend my money on causes that know how to help kids in need.

Why isn't the inability to care for a child a litmus test for adult functioning applied to the people having the children by their peers? Like we get it you judge everyone else based upon whatever egotistical inner philosophy you've got going on, but don't expect us to care or listen about what you have to say.",childfree

To CF or not to CF,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend (soon to be ex) for over a year now.

Why I don't want children ever,"I just wanted to make a personal list to have saved if anyone bingos me in the future, as something for later reference.
Now I don't want children because: 

1. I never saw myself as parent material. While I had baby dolls, I grew to be creeped out by them and never really raved about a family when I was younger like most young girls are brainwashed to believe.

2. Family genes suck, from diabetes, high blood pressure, to cancer of all types. If it's not me catching something avoidable due to pregnancy, I wouldn't want another human to be born with that same and worsening conditions. I am also very physically weak and biological kids would destroy me, but kids at all would slowly kill me faster, if that makes sense.

3. I have a degree of some mental illness, with depressive and anxious episodes hitting every so often as I try to not self harm anymore. Plus when your too anxious to even know your own orientation, well, I just would want to focus on small steps at a time.

4. Despite that, I want to improve my mental and physical health so I can best improve myself as a mental health professional. I know in my heart I would feel so much more fulfilled by knowing I made a kids life a little less screwed up than add to a neverending statistic to unfortunate beings, ruined because they were never wanted or treated like money could by their loyalty and love. Plus being in this field, I need to focus on self care and in this case, this is best opportunity to be selfish and smart about it too.

5. This planet is dying and soon people will too due to a lack of resources, once again I do not want to add to the suffering.

6. Pregnancy is terrifying, so many things can go wrong and as a woman of color, my chances of dying in childbirth are much higher in a developed nation. I can't stand the idea of something growing inside of me and destroying me as it forces its way out.

7. I could never subject another human being to the absolute mess that is my family and their very toxic beliefs. Some of them have outright tried to scam others or use them, others are sneaky in their emotional and physical abuse of their children as a form of control. I fear myself slipping into those horrible practices if my patience ever slips and it will come out ugly and repressed.
Yes, I am seeing a therapist.

8. After my life as a sheltered child, I want to live it for me and have the experiences I never got as a kid.

9. As a woman, childcare is expected to fall onto me,  all while it ruins my career, my earnings, possible marriage, lifespan and the research goes on and on about this. So how about no?

10. Low self esteem renders me incapable of believing in myself most days, mentally I'm exhausted as a single person, so how I can expect to have a dependent when at times I can't depend on myself.

And I think that should be it for now. I'll probably refer to this of bingos do come up.",childfree
Something has to be done about overpopulation,"Humans are overpopulated at 7.7 billion but don't want to do anything about it yet we are obsessed with dictating which other animal species are allowed to breed or not allowed to breed￼. And humans are responsible for the biggest wave of extinctions that should not have happened for a long time… Premature extinction for so many species. Because we caused it…We need to do something about our population crisis.￼ But what can we do that is humane? I'm just going to have to be truthful here, sometime down the road when the population gets too out of control I can imagine people taking drastic measures. This is a topic that no one wants to talk about but might become a reality at some point way after we die, some generation in the future may unfortunately see that day come to pass. So what do we do for our generation to deal with human overpopulation the humane way? Personally I think we need to push for the insurance companies to pay for sterilization procedures in full. They don't cover them in full or at all. The way I see it is, if you're paying them to cover medical procedures they better pay for the medical procedures in full. Make birth-control free, but make sure that people talk to a doctor to see which one is right for them. I mean big pharmaceuticals is just worried that they're going to lose money when they have billions of dollars at their disposal. Make condoms free. Keep abortion legal, that's a very important thing. I don't see why it's anyone else's business and most of the protesters I've ever seen were women… Disgusting women. It's none of their damn business if we decide not to have a baby. There are literally millions if not billions of unwanted children out there… Not many people are having abortions it's not going to put a dent in the population at all… It's barely a scratch. But it's no one's business other than ours anyway. The way I see it is if someone really wants a child they need to adopt one. They bitch and whine about how much money it costs and how long they have to wait but for a pregnancy you have to wait nine months anyway and pay a shit ton of money as well… So just adopt.",childfree

Getting Burnt Out on Other People's Kids,"I'm going to try and summarize a series of events that happened to me in the past couple of days that encapsulate the problems I have dealing with the spawn of strangers. Forgive me if I am a bit incoherent about it:

\-Monday: I work at a Halloween store, and people ask me every day ""gosh, don't you get tired of hearing the animatronics going off all day?"" At least once I have answered like this ""Honestly? It's the kids shrieking in response that gets to me."" And on that day, they were relentlessness: No less than five families with children under five years came in, and each group had a shrike-child. My mysophonia was really wearing away at my psyche, when a pair of breeders came up to try on costumes... with their two sproglydites in tow. One was maybe 6, the other was barely into the walking stage. Both parents disappear into the fitting rooms, tacitly leaving me to watch these two brats... who were the worst. Taking stuff off of pegs, not putting them back, constant noise. What really got to me was that the older kid picked up on my frustration and asked me about my day, so I had to talk around the fact that she was a factor to my very obvious misery. That an the littler one fell over and made a big production of crying, which once the parents came out was met with ""oooh you're not hurt."" Guess how the child responded? Moar crying.

\-Today (Part 1): On my walk home from classes, i found three of the neighbor kids (big family next door, at least five children) were standing in one of the trees that line my street... tearing branches off of them I tell these kids:""Hey, should you really be doing that? That's a public tree.""They all simultaneously gave me this 'shut up you're not my mom' look, so I moved on for home. If I see it happen again, maybe I'll antagonize them a bit more strongly. I am of the opinion that trees are worth more than human children Sue me.

\-Today (Part 2) Went shopping with my SO and roommate went grocery shopping at peak faaaaamily hours. Behind us in the first few yards of the store's circuit was a Dad with a kid that was, at most, entering middle-school. They were having a banal, *really banal*, conversation that for it's repetitiveness and banality drove me mad. The Dad, repeatedly asking if his kid liked grilled chicken; his son, insisting he only liked breaded. Considering the above events, it was likely a ""bitch-eating-crackers"" kind of thing, and my SO picked up on it. His response, while he told me later was inquisitive, came across to me at the time as  very judgmental:""You're getting mad at them for having a normal conversation?""They were having it at a volume where I could hear every word on an endless loop, right behind us. So I was taciturn and morose throughout the shopping trip, catastrophysing that this response was a sign that my CF other half secretly will want to change his mind one day, when the shrieking starts. Again, my mysophonia stabs my brain like a knife. It got so bad, I hid in the refrigerated beer section for a full five minutes... when I hate beer and the cold. SO and I eventually talked: he agreed not to word such questions with such a judgmental bent, I agreed to not try hiding my bad feelings like I did (I come across as passive-aggressive to him when I don't talk about my issues with him, when really this is my defense mechanism to avoid starting a public fight. Yaaaay abusive childhood) but still, I don't understand why that Dad had to repeatedly ask about grilled chicken. Are daddicts so brain-dead that they have to ask a question five times to absorb the answer?",childfree

"Please do not let your child play with a loud dog toy in line, thanks.","This happened at TJ Maxx today. I walked into the store and got it line in order to return an item. The line wasn't too long, but it was about 10min between waiting and exiting the store. About two people behind me is a mom with her toddler in the basket. A TJ Maxx employee begins chatting with the mom and tells her how cute her son is. The mom and employee are talking about how cute the halloween stuff is in line and she says she wants to pick out something for her son.

The mom then picks out a halloween dog toy that squeaks and squishes it to make sure the sqeaker works, which it does because it was very loud. The mom says to the line, ""sorry everyone, I didn't know that noise was going to be so loud!""

She then gives said sqeaky dog toy to her toddler in the basket. The toddler thinks this is the coolest shit he has ever seen. Both the mom and employee are all, ""oh he looks so cute with his toy! etc."" The child then proceeds to sqeak the toy repeatedly. This goes on for a minute straight and I am normally a very patient person. Another two minutes go by, and the kid is STILL squeaking this godforsaken toy that is louder than any dog toy I have ever heard. After about four minutes, the mom says ""that's enough sweety"" and puts the toy back on the shelf. By that time I was at the register and getting out of there ASAP. If anyone in that line had any sort of hearing impairment or sensitivity, that shit would have been so uncomfortable for them to hear. End rant.",childfree
I'm extremely selfish..,"I don't want kids. For many reasons, some of them are completely ""selfish"" and some aren't.

I don't want kids because of overpopulation. I mean, why go and pop out cum-tumors when you could just adopt children who need homes because their parents died or something (not that I'm really fond of that idea either.)

I don't want them because I want to keep my well-earned money to myself. And to do that, you need a job. I *want* to work long hours doing what I love and drive in my expensive car to the silent, beautiful house I paid off early because I didn't have children attached to me.

I want to travel someday. I want to see Africa and Europe and all those places, but I wouldn't be able to because not only would crotch-goblins suck up all my money, but it's not safe for them there. My own mother has expressed that she's wanted to go and see Africa, or go on a Safari tour (is that what they're called, lol?) but she can't because she has my younger brother and I, and we are two, mostly-defenseless children.

I want to be loved. I don't want to be loved by my family one day, pop out a baby, and then have them all fawn over it when it fucking breathes. One day, I want to be in an amazing, fun, *loving* marriage and I don't want to just become second-best to a baby who hasn't done anything mildly great.

If I ever get married, I want to stay in love with whoever it is. I don't want to slowly fall out of love because a child has taken up too much of our time, and we can't do normal couple-y things that make us fall even further in love.

Also, pregnancy. I'm a slightly overweight teenager. I want to lose that weight eventually, and have a body I can be proud of. Pregnancy would ruin that for me. I'm also not fond of the thought of pushing a bald watermelon (as opposed to hairy watermelons lol) out of my vagina.

My parents sided with me!,"After my sister asked me to pretty much raise her child, my parents, unexpectedly side with me.

I finally told my sister I refused to watch her kid all the time and my parents totally backed me up and told her they wouldnt let her take advantage of me or my situation and that it wasn't fair. 

It's up to me and her to work something out but they said ""if you don't make enough to pay your own sister to babysit then we will help you get the paperwork you need to get childcare assistance."" my mom even promised me a day out to get all my errands done and help me make some of the phone calls I need to make. My stepdad usually stays out of our arguments but this time he said I deserve respect and just because I'm not working doesn't mean I don't have things to do.

My mom has always been supportive (even of being childfree) so I'm thankful but I honestly didn't expect this I was sure they would side with my sister since shes got a brat now and all and it's their first grand goblin but they didn't go all soft and gooey instead they totally kept their composer and were real with us both.",childfree

"""And they had adorable kids""","I'm sorry but from experience every time someone references the positive aspects of a marriage they have to reference lovely kids, they only talk about the children instead of the relationship. Even if the couple hasnt has children, the family drools over your potential reproductive abilities.

Like, yeah, you managed to make a semen demon that is cute, but what about the relationship before the child?

Sometimes it feels like people are forcing you into having children just so you can enxperience the same marital problems as they did.",childfree
I am officially free~!! Gas question though.,"Welp I am home and this baby factory is forever closed!! 

Surgery was at noon, had to be there at 10, but I had an 1 hour and 16 min drive so had to leave early x.x 

Well get there, everyone is so nice. Get called back and every nurse, doctor, surgeon were so nice! No bingos, only one asked if I had aby kids, but didn't ask past that when I said no. Pretty much had to ask routine questions only. :) 

Woke up on and off during recovery, they had to stop me from pulling the nose air thing when I was first pulled to recovery lol was a real struggle to wake up.
Oh boy did I get those gas pains, in BOTH shoulders x.x
Some discomfort at the cuts, but not too bad. 
Didn't wait for me to go pee, but it was all good, I had to go once I got back. 
Boyfriend drove me to his place for a bit before I went to my parents. 
While at his place I tried to lay on my side, but it was not comfortable at all, so I sat up and stayed sitting till I got up to go home. 

And now just had another bad gas pain under my breast, felt like under a rib, which quickly moved to my back and it hurt so baaaad. 

I haven't taken any gas x as the doctor said it probably wouldn't help much, as that pretty much is only for stomach/intestinal. 

Did anyone have the gas x actually help or is my doctor right and I just need to push through this. 

They did give some narc I think it was and Motrin. Havent taken any of those yet either. My try the Motrin, but i want to avoid the hard stuff if I can.",childfree
"""That's not possible, my kids are asleep by 10!""","A post I read in the group this morning reminded me to share this story from my life. Moderately long story, tl;dr at bottom. 

I had recently moved into a newly renovated apartment in my old building (where I had lived with my parents) and I was all settled in. I had been working for a couple of years. As an actuary, I was working long hours. I would use what little free time I had left during the week, sitting on the couch, relaxing and studying for my professional exams. 

Every single day, from when I got home to when I went to bed there were horses clomping and giggling above my head, shaking my light fixtures, slowly driving me crazy. Most weekends too. See, the single mother above me had two obnoxious children, aged 5 and 8.  Their bedroom was above my living room. I had a heavy curtain rod that I would use to hit the ceiling with when it became too much. At 25, I was the old man banging on my ceiling telling the lousy kids to keep it down!

Finally, I went upstairs one night, around midnight, and quietly knocked on her door. I explained my daily experience. She told me what I said was simply impossible, as her kids were asleep by 10 pm! I don't think she's that blind in a one bedroom apartment to not know when her kids are running around. She just couldn't be bothered, as many parents (more so single parents), are too exhausted to do so and the rest of us suffer for it.

Being noticeably offended by my accusation, she proceeds to tell me a story about a man that used to live down the hall. My mom confirmed its truth. The man was a hoarder. Not just of things, but also garbage. His apartment stunk up the whole floor (I was too little to remember this). She was pregnant with her first child and was nauseated all the time from the pregnancy and the smell. It lasted through having her second child. But she never said a word! One day he was evicted and the apartment was cleaned, but she NEVER said a word! **She was a good neighbor.**

Meanwhile, there's something in NYC called the 70% rule in her lease, in that 70% of her apartment must be covered in carpeting or she can be evicted, exactly to prevent this shit! So, considerate person that I am, I offer to SPLIT the cost of it with her. She was insulted that I assumed she couldn't pay. She eventually got her evil spawn under control, but thank god she left shortly thereafter. And my ceiling has a number of dents in it. 

Tl;dr - My upstairs neighbor insists a good neighbor doesn't complain. Particularly burdening her with criticism of her obnoxious children. How can I expect her to be a mother? She's legally required to put down carpet but refused, even if I paid half. She doesn't live here anymore. I can't stand parents that think you should share the burden of their kids being annoying because they had them.",childfree

"Would, even the doctors listed, let me make the decision to be sterile very young?","I'm 17, turning 18 this November. 

I really don't want kids. I've never, ever wanted kids. I thought when I was younger that people HAD to have kids, and I absolutely dreaded that day. I eventually learned that one didn't have to after a teacher I had said she liked teaching children, but never was going to plan to have any herself. 

The whole idea of a having to take care of something for the rest of my life sounds 110% miserable, and the idea of carrying a child sounds so utterly disturbing and upsetting to me. 

My whole family has have children very young, my mother herself actually had me when she like 23, which is pretty ""old"" to be having children in this family. I'm getting to that age where everyone has kids in my family and it's scary. It's like everyone's waiting for me, as creepy as that sounds. 

I don't go *fooling* around, but I want to be comfortable with my body. I want to be able to know that getting pregnant is something that can't happen to me.

I guess I'm just wondering, even if I went the doctors in the info section of this subreddit, if they would do it on someone that is 18? I would wait till then to get it done. (I live in Georgia if that matters.)

"I don't have children, so my 7 year relationship is essentially worthless?!","I recently attended a family bbq on a trip home to the UK. My partner of 7 years didn't attend as we live in Asia and this was a solo trip back for a personal emergency and flights cost a fortune.

I met a new baby cousin and was spending a few minutes playing with him. I'm not a fan of kids but a little more tolerant with family.

I got the typical ""you'll be next"" from a family member which I politely responded with no, kids aren't in my future. It was met with the usual ""you'll change your mind"" and ""it's different when they're yours"". Which is pretty hard to listen to when the party giving their opinion is always ill and burnt out from exhaustion. I shrugged it off and changed the conversation.

An hour or so later the same family member came back and asked if my partner and I were still together. I replied with ""of course, he just couldn't afford the trip back this time"", thinking she was making a slightly passive aggressive comment on his absence. But then she said ""no, I mean are you still, like, together? Because you said you aren't having kids?""... now slightly confused I assured her that we are DEFINITELY still together, not having kids doesn't change that. She CONTINUED to press and said ""well, what's the point?"" As in, what's the point of being in a relationship if we don't intend on having children?! 

I could have spent an hour explaining why my relationship is of value without spawning kids, but didn't feel like I should justify myself.

Now I'm not sure whether to be angry about this conversation as it places little importance on the fulfilling relationship I do have with my partner, or sad that her relationship was built with the pure function of having kids?! 

Am I right to feel a little offended here?!",childfree
WHY I DONT WANT CHILDREN,"I feel like I am constantly explaining myself to everyone as to why children have never been on my life checklist. Mind you, I am 20 years old and a female. Reading the posts on here have really helped me realize that i’m not crazy for thinking i’ll never change my mind. 

Anyway I haven’t wanted kids since I myself popped out of the womb. Never played with dolls or played “family”. Never fantizied about having a kid or a big fancy wedding. Don’t really know why that is so baffling to some people. SO here’s some more reasons as to why I don’t want kids and probably why a lot of you don’t want kids! 

1. They’re gross. They touch everything, everything they touch ends up in their mouths. drool, piss, puke and poop. Do I even need to elaborate? Kids are oversized germs. Don’t get me wrong, I love my baby cousins and I love being an aunt, but you’ll never catch me around them long enough to change a diaper or clean up barf. 

2. Pregnancy is fucking horrifying. Props to those women who take it like champs. Nausea, headaches, painful breast and fatigue for 3 months? Only to have your stomach grow the size of a watermelon and feel that thing kick as you go about your day. THEN having to shove that fucker out of your vagina while your shitting yourself (also you can puke and piss yourself simultaneously) and you tear your taint! No sex for months and no sleep for months. WHY would I do that to myself 

3. My genetics are garbage. If my parents had aborted me I could’ve avoided all the thicc medical bills i’ve acquired thanks to my scoliosis, gerd, hormonal issues and skin disease. I would be birthing a child just to pay for its medical bills for life. 

4. My career and my money. If you want to check out explained on netflix, they go into depth about why women are less advanced in the work force *hint (having children ruins your career). Fact of the matter is, women after having children will choose their children over their jobs. My aunt was an occupational therapist. She popped out 3 brats and now she lives at home running after her children all day. She likes it and that’s cool but i’d rather be working and keeping my money for my vacations and investments. 

5. Time. I love having time for myself. I love painting I love to learn. If I have kids, when the fuck am I supposed to have time for myself? Married couples will go years without having sex because everything becomes about the children. No thanks

6. The world is a shithole. I’m a firm believer in “everything going to burn in the near future” Who in their right mind looks at our world right now and thinks raising a child is for the best. The most ridiculous thing i’ve been told is that I am selfish for choosing not to have children. IN MY EYES, it is selfish to bring a child into a world where it will suffer just because you need to fulfill some weird “need” or because you need someone to take care of you when your older. 

Guess I’m just tired of everyone saying “you’ll grow out of it”. I really won’t. I really have tried to think about my life with children and even in my head I can’t force the picture. Children are not for me and they won’t be for me ever. LIKE I SAID, I don’t hate children, I just don’t think they’re cute, I don’t want to hold them and I do NOT want them to tear my taint. Pls comment some ridiculous bullshit people say to you when you tell them you don’t want kids",childfree
Cf thoughts,"My (baby-obsessed) mom accuses me of being anti-children, which is RICH because I love my nephew and I send gifts to one of my friends' daughter every xmas (as well as postcards whenever I go somewhere special) and she knows this.

""we've just got a bunch of killers out here. No one respects life anymore, they just act like it's ok to kill people."" 

I responded with: ""They seem to think it's ok to create lives they don't have any way to support or provide for, too. That's just as disrepectful. There's no difference."" 

She shut RIGHT up.

Another thought: most people are probably familiar with the Bechdel test. Defininition as follows: 

[The Bechdel test, also known as the Bechdel–Wallace test, is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added. Wikipedia]

I really wish there was a similar thing regarding kids, motherhood, pregnancy and babies. It seems like very often, when female characters aren't discissing men, writers find the only alternative to be kids. It bothers me.

What bothers me more is how accurate that is. I find most women cannot carry a conversation about anything else.",childfree

"Why do you have to pay a pet deposit at an apartment, but not a child deposit?","So, this is something that's gotten on my nerves for a while now. And I'm so glad I found this community of like-minded people to talk about this stuff with! 

Why do I have to pay an extra (non refundable) $400 to let my dog live with me in an apartment or rental home while someone with 1+ kids don't have to? My dog is extremely well behaved, doesn't make noise unless someone knocks on the door (which is never because we never have company), doesn't make a mess, listens extremely well, and our place will look exactly the same when we leave as it did when we moved in. But people with kids (who notoriously will make messes and possibly more damage than my pet) doesn't have to pay anything more? And on top  of that, we have to pay an extra $15 a month for the pet rent?? In the 4 years we've lived at our place, we've spent an extra $720 on top of the $400 deposit just so my dog can exist in our home. So why does my apartment get to profit off of my dog, but not kids? The apartments certainly don't use that extra money to do anything for me or my dog.

My neighbor had a kid who literally destroyed our mailbox (we share a mailbox), and put a hole in the wall, but they didn't have to pay extra? 

Both dogs AND kids are a CHOICE to have. But having one of them penalizes you? Also, someone might say ""well, with a dog, you can just give it away and not have that pet charge"" when saying that is literally like someone telling me to give my family member away. My dog isn't just something I could drop off somewhere just like someone wouldn't give up their kid to live somewhere!!

Sorry if that sounds whiny...

I'd love to know if it's the same everywhere or if it's just in America. Anyone else ever been somewhere that charges a deposit for kids to live somewhere?",childfree

Childfreeness as a carefully deliberated decision.,"I have been having thoughts sort of pinging through my head the past couple of weeks and I've been wanting to lay them out on pen and paper. This is, of course, nothing that hasn't already been discussed on this subreddit before. I just feel like I wanted to lay my thoughts out in an area where people will listen and be able to relate.

I don't like children. I don't dislike children. I will complain about them but I'm mostly quite neutral. For the longest time, I believed that children where just what happened to people. An event in life that occurred that you had to plan your wants and needs around because ...well it happened. (I mean I also had the same thoughts about marriage too.....that got destroyed...)

I never wanted children. I had no particularly strong desire for them. Even then, I laid my want aside and thought about should I have children. 

In this day and age, depending on where you live, children aren't necessary and they really aren't inevitable. So now I'm settled with the responsibility of choosing \~not only\~ a final decision on creation of human life but childfreedom also involves not supporting children already alive. You are choosing to live you life w/o children. Sure you can babysit, donate to causes, etc

It was a very economic decision for me really. Nurturing the young is \*not\* a strong suit of mine. I believe the best way to have the most cumulative positive influence on a child is to raise them. And I am not good at that. I have to interest or drive to become good at it. I instead decided that no, rather than raise children, I'll participate has a global citizen trying to improve the world as a whole. I may not succeed. I'm probably not going to make any impact but in the division of labor, I choose changing the environment rather than actively participating in raising children. 

So no, Mom &amp; Dad. I'm not just doing this because it's a fad or the new thing or I'm just enjoying adult life. I sat down and had a strong session of self-reflection. What am I good at? Where are my strengths and weaknesses. How can help other people the most? Similarly to how I chose a college major that did lead to a good job, how I'm not in debt, my careful spending habits, and constant learning, I chose childfreedom and lent my energies and focus elsewhere. Where I can be the happiest, most helpful, and productive. 

Just have some faith in my decision making skills. I should've proven that to you by now.

Told my partner I'm not thinking ahead in our relationship because he is a fence sitter.,"Hi all. I guess this is more of a vent than a request for advice, but any advice is appreciated.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year and a half now, and mostly it's been a lot of fun. He's in his last year of grad school while I'm finishing up my last year of undergrad. I've been interviewing with a bunch of big companies to try and find a software job, and it's been going well so far (yay). However, last night my boyfriend and I had a serious talk about what happens if we don't get job offers in the same city. I told him point blank that as long as he's a fence sitter, even though he is leaning towards no kids, I won't consider him or his location in my ultimate decision for a job. This upset him greatly, especially because he is in a more niche field and it will be harder for him to find jobs in multiple cities. He got really upset, stating that he has told me he is leaning towards no kids and would pick me over hypothetical children. I then told him that was naive of him, because if he only didn't have kids because of me he would have so much resentment. 

Am I crazy here? I love him, I really do. But I'll be 21 years old when I graduate, wayyy too young to let my first job out of college be determined by a partner. And while I can see us having a future, I am not really willing to genuinely work for it because he just isn't sure.

3rd pregnancy announcement in 2 months at the office,"I know it's not that big of a deal, but there are over 20 women on my team, while a few are on maternal leave and three of them are pregnant, soon to go on maternal leave. There are only 3 of us who aren't parents, but two of us are trying...

  As post title says, today a third colleague  announced her pregnancy. Just like the usual, I smiled, said congrats and proceeded to stuff my face with cake because 1 I love cake and 2 it's a good excuse to not have to join my colleagues as they go: ""awwwwww"", ""oh, my god, how beautiful"", ""that's so amazing"" etc for 20 minutes.

Today though, I got pissed. Because my pregnant co-worker isn't the youngest person (to be having a kid I mean) and she already has another kid who's 10-11. So when one of them asked how she's going to manage, a few happily explained that ""well, don't worry, her kid is old enough to be helping her"". Thankfully another coworker had the common sense to say ""well, maybe not necessarily help, but just play with their sibling"". But of course the others had to protest, that, no, kid is definitely old enough, they can totally help mum raise younger kid. 

Like. No. Just no! I hate it so much when people have kids so far apart, especially when they justify it with ""my kid wants a sibling"". No, Karen, your 10 yo doesn't want a baby brother/sister, they want a friend of a similar age who they can play with! When they're 14, they don't want to be babysitting their 4yo sibling when all of their friends are going to the movies. When they're 18, they don't want to worry about their sibling's 2nd grade homework because they'll be so busy with getting into college. Most of all, no kid wants to parent their sibling. Nor should they!

Sorry for any and all mistakes, English is not my first language + posting from phone + tired.

TL,DR I feel inadequate with all the pregnancy and baby talk at my office- and there's lots of it!

Tubal Ligation and IUD question,"Hey all.

I just had my surgery today for my tubal ligation. It went super well! Technically I had a salpingectomy, because my OBGYN believes that it's more effective.

I just called her after I found out, and she said that she owes me an IUD. However, now I have to go through the pain of having it put in again. 

I don't know what to do. Should I ask that she either put one in for free or something comparable such as Nexaplon? It wasn't my fault that my wishes weren't met, and I don't feel like I should have to pay almost $1,000 out of pocket to fix a mistake she made.

In this particular library there is a vast and fantastic children's section. They were doing a toddler sing along in the mids section on loud speakers with a reader and musician. I think it's really cool. I knew at some point it would end so I put on my headphones and got into an LSAT study session. 

What bothers me is how tired the parents all looked and how every single one of them let their kids out of children's section and tear around the rest of the library screaming and stomping. Dozens of them. 

I couldnt focus and shot every parent wrapped into their phones a hot glare. Not one of them was even trying to control their crotch fruits. 

These are the same people who believe that I'll also one day have children or want them.",childfree

Good news! Also tubal vs hysterectomy?,"So I'm 28F (married, no kids). I'm trying to get sterilized.

I'm in the military so it's kind of hard to just go to any doctor. Today I talked to my doctor about getting a referral to get sterilized. I told him my story and he supports me getting it and got me a referral! He even put in my file some notes that will encourage a surgeon to want to do the procedure on me.

I'm so excited!

I'm in between wanting a tubal and a partial hysterectomy (I think I spelled that right).

Does anyone in here have any inputs on one vs the other?

Do couples who don’t have children regret it later in their lives?,"I’m 19 and a young man and I don’t think I want kids because I don’t want the time consumption and responsibility, as pathetic and immature as that may sound. I want to be in marriage with a successful woman who is ambitious and may be focused more on her career or work and is more disciplined. Not the stay at home traditional type. From this, we can have leisure in our time off. Traveling to romantic getaways, for instance, taking classes to learn new skills, going Driving in the country side, and simply having fun with our lives. I know this may sound like a very immature fantasy, but I just don’t have the burning desire to have a child and be a father. I’m conflicted on the matter. 

I’ve heard that couples who don’t have kids have an empty void in their lives, something that is lacking that should be occupied by the raising a family. 

I’ve also heard that having kids matures you and forces you to grow up, because you are putting someone else in front of you. I’ve heard that you can’t and won’t mature into a full adult without having kids and you won’t take your place in the world.

Having children is inevitably the right answer, I’ve heard.",childfree
"Him - ""You should honestly never raise kids, you wouldn’t be good at it."" Me - ""...Duh?""","So a few days ago I got into it with a user over on r/insaneparents. The argument was over a teenager whose parents were taking away his car for not having his Life360 (real-time tracking app) on, even though the battery in his phone was out. He had no control over the situation, being forced to keep the app on at all times had drained his battery to nothing. 

After arguing with this guy in the comments for a bit, he hits me with the finisher line:

&gt; You should honestly never raise kids, you wouldn’t be good at it. 

And guess what? He's right. I would be a horrible parent - selfish, lacking empathy, entirely focused on my work life and hobbies. 

Doesn't mean I'm wrong, though. It infuriates me that people think that just because you don't want children means you're inept at dealing with anything related to them. My opinion that the parent's punishments are insane isn't relevant at all to my hypothetical kids at all or how I would raise them? I don't need kids to have an opinion? I'll never understand this line of logic.

Of course, after digging into this guy's profile it's all made clear. This guy is a troll - he gets off on being purposefully contrarian/an asshole all over Reddit. Go figure  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.",childfree
Mom wanted liver transplant - update (I turned her down),"I just wanted to write a short update, as so many of you have been amazingly supportive.

I have spoken to the people involved; my mom, my siblings and the medical staff, and told everyone that I won’t donate a part of my liver to my alcoholic mother.

The doctor at the hospital where my mother was treated initially when her liver crashed, simply said “I understand, but that also means that I must inform you that you need to prepare to say good bye to her in a not very distant future”.

I might not particulary like  my mother but I don’t wish death on anyone, so that sucks. But again, she drank her liver away. It took years of hard work to reach the place where she is now. She’s been to several clinics, gotten all sorts of help. She would stay until they stopped treat her abstinence with oxascand and then check out and start it all over again. So much of the tax payers money has been spent (and thrown away) on her, and she refuses to take any responsibility at all. It’s always the nurses or the doctors fault that she drinks – “they don’t give me the right treatment”. I think she would do the same to any donated liver. I told the doctor this.

My sister said that she understood, and now that things have had time to calm down a bit, she even said that she thinks it’s the right thing to do. My brother does not agree with my decision, and I told him that he can donate a nice slice of his own liver then, but then of course he tells me that’s he can’t, because he got kids and it’s too much of a risk for him to take. I, on the other hand, am obviously disposable .

And my mother. I almost can’t be bothered to type it out. I phoned her to tell her that she will not be getting my liver, and as expected she went from jovial to resentful by the drop of a hat.

Everything from “I’m your mother, you only get one mother” to “you must be there for family” was thrown at me. She even referred to the fact that I once risked my life for my dog, when she went through the ice on a frozen lake, but “you won’t do this for your mom?!”.

No. No I will not, actually.  She tsaid many rather awful things, I guess I can understand that she is upset and scared, but even I got a limit at to how much of that shit I’m willing to stand - so eventually I just said that I am done and hung up. Not sure what to expect now, don’t really care either. I’m glad that my sister came around, perhaps my brother will if given time. Maybe not. Either way, I’m happy to have made my decision clear. Now that it’s done, I can get back to enjoying my life far from them all, in the comfort of my home and in the company of my awesome dogs.

Thanks to all of you who have shown interest, given support and cheered me on, it meant the world to me.

sterilisation help/advice for f/31/uk," 

Hi everyone. Short time lurker first time poster here. I've just received my referral letter for an appointment at a local hospital to discuss potential sterilisation. From the research I've done, it seems a bilateral salpingectomy would be the most effective treatment for me. However, the GP who did the referral said I was very unlikely to be approved for sterilisation at all, let alone a bisalp. It seems a bisalp is the 'gold standard' in the US rather than the UK. It is the only method of sterilisation I would consider as it seems other methods have similar efficacy levels to LARC.

I would like to hear from anyone from the UK who has recently been successful in getting the okay for a bilateral salpingectomy. I understand that historically it may have been easier to access female sterilisation but recent NHS funding cuts may have affected this. I'm creating a sterilisation binder to take with me and will be taking my long term monogamous partner with me for support.

I wondered particularly if how I present myself is likely to make any difference. I am pierced and tattooed with an unnatural hair colour. I don't know if I should try to hide this/tone it down (remove piercings and cover tattoos etc) for the appointment? Or if it really wouldn't make any difference?

I have very low hopes of a positive outcome but think I've got nothing to lose by trying. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",childfree

Stuck in a hard place and just want to develop cohesive thoughts,"I’m a female, about to turn 30 and have been married to my husband for just over 4 years. Wayyy back when, during our premarital class (required by my Lutheran church where we had the ceremony) we had the talk. At that time we both agreed 1-2 kids would be good. In between then and now, my husband went back to night school and got an MBA, which he recently finished. He’s starting to get the baby fever, since we agreed well before he’d started that we weren’t going to have kids while he was working on it (it was always in his plan to get the MBA). 

In that time, I’ve slowly been losing the desire to have children, to the point it’s not in my wants. We have a lot of neighbors with kids, some of whom are wild and can be heard screaming outside while I’m inside with all windows and doors closed. I cringe in those moments, or any time a baby screams in public. 

I’ve stated my position many times to my husband, and I’m not sure he believes me/wants to see the benefit of how we have it now. I get children can be rewarding, but you have to want them. 

I love my husband, doing things with him, and our current situation. 

I’m fairly certain I need to take this to a professional to talk it out, but wanted to start here in case anyone has been in the same boat.

23/F and seeking sterilization,"Hi everyone!

I apologize if this has been asked here before, but I could use some advice.

I’m certain that I never want children, I always have been. Like many of you on this subreddit the daydreams I’ve had about my future have never included children. 

Over the last nine years, I’ve tried about 7 different types of hormonal birth control options which have all left me with undesirable side effects — mainly depression, low libido, and *unbearable pain during intercourse*. Birth control has basically ruined my sex life and it’s really aggravating because I never want kids anyway. I’ve been with my partner for 5 years now, we’re both CF, and the pill I’m on right now has thrown all of our intimacy out of the window. I refuse to try MORE hormones, and an IUD sounds like a disaster waiting to happen from what I’ve read on the birthcontrol subreddit.

I’ve been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and my aunt recently had to have a full hysterectomy due to a tumor on an ovary. From what I’ve heard, a bi-salp lowers ovarian cancer risk so going ahead with the procedure seems like a win-win-win: no kids, no hormones, lower risk of cancer.

I keep reading articles online about women in their late twenties and thirties being denied sterilization with all sorts of ridiculous bingo responses like “you’ll change your mind when you’re older”. Being a 23 year old, I feel pretty hopeless that any doctor will actually agree to give me a bi-salp regardless of my reasoning and responses to their probing questions. I get really pissed off when people try to imply that they know more about my future than I do (what gives??) and I’m really not looking forward to potentially going to several doctors only to be disrespected over and over.  I’ve checked out the list of CF doctors but I’m not sure how they will respond to a 23/24 year old woman.

Does anyone have any advice?? 
Thank you!",childfree
Why Are There So Many Teenagers In Residential Areas,"One thing I've noticed is that some more affordable neighborhoods in my area are filled with kids and I don't know why. It's a mix of ethnicities as well.

Meanwhile expensive areas have very few kids even if they have houses. Teenagers have torn the front door off my apartment building. If I'm out past 1 AM I see hordes of teenagers riding bicycles in the middle of the road popping wheelies and drinking beer and energy drinks. I've heard these large groups of children look for old people to beat up.

The question I have is, why can't the city distribute the kids evenly throughout the city? When I'm by my job at night this never happens. The area is completely dead and the kids don't rattle adults around. My dad said they shook him down for coins before.",childfree
The damage to your car is litterally a mix between your entitlement and your child’s negligence. Quit wasting my time.,"I work as a claims adjuster and got this claim where someone (let’s name him Joe ) was with his child, to visit Bob’s elderly parents and parked in Bob’s driveway. Apparently they were getting ready to leave aka the kid was in the car but Joe was not. Bob pulled in his driveway after work. Due to the angle of Bob’s driveway and it being dark out, Bob couldn’t see that the rear passenger side door of Joe’s car was open until he had already hit it. (That’s the door the kid got in)

The way I see it, Bob shouldn’t owe for Joe’s damages. Joe parked in BOB’s driveway and let his crotch goblin get in on his own then not shut the door behind himself then had the audacity to be upset with Bob for his car being damaged. 

Like don’t park in MY driveway and leave your doors open like you’re setting up for a yard sale  n shit then combine that  with “my son left the door open, but it’s your fault”. Cause that’s not valid a arguement for me to issue a check. If your child is old  enough to open the door by themselves then they are old enough to shut it or at least be held responsible for the consequences of NOT shutting it. 

I don’t feel that Bob’s policy owes for Joe’s damages. I’m no parent,  but I feel that Joe should use this expensive repair to teach his child that there are repercussions for not picking up after yourself.

That’s like leaving your toys on the floor of your older brother’s room then being mad your toy broke. You don’t get to be mad when your big brother trips over your toy because you left it in the walkway of HIS room. 

Why are there childish parents raising kids? Its like leaving a 10 year old to watch a 9 year old. Its pointless and a waste of everyone else’s time!",childfree
Thinking of starting a childfree meetup group [Scotland - Edinburgh],"Hey guys :)

I (27M) am thinking of starting a childfree meetup group via [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) in Edinburgh. I understand it's tricky to find like-minded folks these days, and what I want to create is a relaxed space where people with childfree values can come together and make friends and/or date

I'm based in Edinburgh, and at least on the meetup website there seems to be a bit of interest already in the concept of a group. Taking a much bigger city like London for instance, they maintain a very active childfree group, and I'm keen to emulate that in Scotland! Ideally it would be Edinburgh based, but I'm open to suggestion

I understand the audience here is mostly US (sorry!), but I'd like to gauge the interest of people living in/moving to Scotland as there's quite a few subscribers on the subreddit

Cheers :)

My 18th birtbday and a baby shower,"A friend of ours had a baby two days ago, and my parents told me that we'll visit them at the beginning of November. Okay, fine, I'm not fond of the idea to be honest.
Yesterday, I told my mom what I wanted for my 18th birthday (my parents always ask me what I want for my bday). I wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant. For the three of us, it'd cost around $100. But mom refused, because it's ""too expensive"".
BUT! To visit a newborn kid, it's not expensive to go across the country, renting an apartment, the cost of food AND gifts for the baby. I did the maths and it'll cost AT LEAST $350!! (Am from the EU)

"17, child free and have met a guy who is also child free (woopee) !","Hi everyone, I've been child free for a while now but it's only after being recommended this platform by the guy I'm dating, I could put a name to it. He is a bit crazy like myself and I think that's why we get along so well! 

Although I don't mind kids, I've never actually wanted to have any of my own. I want to have a fairly peaceful life without the chaos involved with having children; a quite library, two cats and pot of roobos tea are all I need for a fulfilled life. 

The only child I ever want to be involved with is my baby cousin. I want to make sure he grows up to be a decent person and to spoil him at Christmas etc. However, I feel like having kids (even in my 30s) would ruin this! I would no longer be able to focus solely on him and I would have a bunch of tiny, pollution causing humans to contend with (btw. Kids cause a lot of waste).

I know I'm young, but I want to enjoy life to it's fullest instead of stressing over my body clock or worrying about my finances. I want to travel, have a successful career, have fun - I am so excited about my life ahead of me (without kids of course)!

Being childfree in traditional immigrant communities is weird AF.,My family comes from east Africa and we live in the US. We have a sizable community in the city I live in. Now that I'm pushing 30 everyone is shocked that I don't have kids yet. Literally everyone I went to high school with and all of my cousins has at least 2-3 kids. Even the girls who had ambitions and wanted careers. I mean some of them got there eventually but it definitely would've been easier without children. A lot of these people seem to have the mentality that once they fulfill their obligation to pop out a few kids then they can start their lives. I know a girl who had 3 kids back to back starting at 18 and then just dumped them on her husband and parents. Now she pretty much lives her life as if she doesn't have cildren. And I still get more backlash than her. It's bizarre.,childfree

Babysitting,"I have a 3 year old niece and my mom usually babysits her while my brother and his fiancé are at work (2pm-2am, they work night shift). My moms been getting tired and stressed from having to watch my niece everyday (except weekends) so sometimes I’ll help out a little. 

But, I hate babysitting and I hate being around children. I’ve told my parents this a million times, how I don’t like the responsibility and I just don’t wanna do it. She’s not my kid, I never offered to watch her so it shouldn’t fall on me. 

Then today, my dad was saying that I had to help cause my mom was tired, even though she said I didn’t have to help. He said that him and me will watch my niece for my mom. Which doesn’t even make sense because she’ll just want my mom anyway. But I said no because it’ll all fall to me and my dad won’t do anything.

We’ve gotten into fights before about how I’m not responsible because I don’t wanna babysit. They both know I’m childfree, but my dad doesn’t seem to get it. I’ve told them I don’t wanna babysit, but I still hang out with my niece a little cause she’s my niece and obviously I care about her. Sometimes I’ll take her to the park and give my mom a break. I just hate the responsibility. And she’s naughty because everyone gives her what she wants so when you say no, she flips out. It’s fucking stressful just being around her for 20 minutes. 

How can I get my dad to understand I’m not going to help with this, and that I don’t want to be apart of it without sounding like an asshole. 

I am moving out soon, but that won’t be for a couple months and my mom watches her every week day. I do feel bad for my mom, but I keep telling her to tell my brother that she can’t do it, he has to figure out something else. But she feels too bad to do that cause they’re family. 

I don’t want to seem ungrateful to my parents because they help everyone so much. My mom is absolutely amazing, but I just hate being around kids. It makes me angry and stressed. It takes a huge toll on my mental health. They just don’t seem to get it.

My thought who is paying for all these kids you want to pop out and foster when you don't even know which country you might up next tomorrow made no sense to me. 

Now over that breakup, back dating and having fun and the first thing I make clear that I DO NOT WANT KIDS. So i just met a girl who I'm having a fun time with and she knows I don't want kids and I thought she said same thing but she just disclosed that she could go either way- and I don't like that answer so I probed her and asked ' would you regret never being pregnant' she said yes so now I have to leave this good potential thing! 

But my reason for posting is that as a gay woman when did all these lesbian start wanting all these kids- I swear many were just not about that not only because back in the day we just couldn't even get married. My lord the process is long and expensive as a gay person. I thought less lesbians wanted kids- maybe I dreamt that up!

Feels like I'm dommed to be single forever or end up with a woman when I'm like 40 with older kids which I don't want either!

Instead of being the working, learning parents who gets three hours of sleep that you always see in online college commercials. Going to a community college by the way, no ITT Tech or UoP for me! $6000 for an associate's isn't too bad!

I share a wall with a child and have been woken up at 3:30am when mom has custody,"I'm in a tough spot at the moment and my friend is letting me rent a room in her house (So saying just move out...yeah, not an option). 

I share a wall with her 2 year old son...specifically our beds are on the same wall. And he wakes up super early and fucking *screams* which wakes me up...but not mom down the hall. He will scream for 20+ minutes before he goes back to sleep. 

I confronted her about it and she's just like what earplugs. Like, okay I'll try that but you're really going to let him scream like that for that long?? Oh it's what parents do I guess and I dont have kids so what do I know.

It just seems like to be considerate you'd be more aware of it and try to get him. Especially since its effecting my sleep and my morning routine.. I hit snooze so much on my alarm I'm not giving myself *any* time to get ready. My eyes are heavy as I type this...

Thanks for letting me rant. But seriously is it normal to let a child scream...literally scream not cry for 20+ minutes?

I might move my bedroom around and take my bed off that wall.",childfree

"""You'll grow out of it"" or ""You deserve to die""","That's what people say to me when I say I don't want kids. 


*""You'll grow out of it""*: 

Parents, relatives and friends say this to me all the time. 

First realized I didn't want kids 6 years ago when I was 15 and now I still don't want them (and am actually scared that I'll change my mind in the future). I get pretty annoyed that people don't trust that I'm old enough to make the decision and expect everyone to eventually grow out of it.


*""You deserve to die""*: 

Happened on one occasion (but we were pretty young so I don't blame him). Also, everyone here (Southeast Asia) think that everyone needs to have a kid and that's the purpose of life. Was even told by a teacher in high school that the main purpose of mankind is to reproduce and pass on our lineage. I guess this is true to some extent but the overpopulation is overboard. And I think this mindset is probably everywhere just more entrenched in Asian societies?

"These are all the ""toddler"" issues I can handle","If I flared this wrong, I apologise. I wasn't sure what else to tag it.

I have a 4 year old dog and 6 month old kitten. My boyfriend wakes up at 4:30 for work and I'm laid off right now so I wake up with him. Normally this isn't a problem, but last night I couldn't fall asleep until about 11. 

The kitten regularly wakes me up at 3 or 4 trying to nurse on my earlobes. I've started sleeping with a blanket that she tries to nurse on so I can move her to that when she starts trying to nurse on me, but it wasn't working last night. 

On top of that, last night the dog started getting jealous of the kitten getting attention, so she was pawing at her and they started playing on top of me. Every morning as soon as the alarms go off, the dog gets super excited (understandably) and starts jumping on me and my boyfriend licking our faces. The kitten gets the zoomies and sprints around the apartment, including running over my face. 

It's not the end of the world since I can sleep during the day, and normally the morning routine doesn't bother me. But thinking of how much worse babies and toddlers are... It's just a nightmare. 

I know for a fact that I couldn't handle it. I would be an abusive, shitty, neglectful parent. I would resent the kid. I would be so mad and frustrated and impatient. I would hate them and hate dealing with them. I'm the exact kind of person who shouldn't have kids, and I am 5,000% ok with that. Thank fuck my boyfriend and I are both going to get fixed, and that this is the most ""toddler"" stuff I'll ever have to deal with.",childfree
Seeking reassurance..,"Hi guys! Im a full time lurker, first time poster. Sorry if i dont make sense. 

So im 35 yr old female.  Suffered with server mental health issue's since i was a child.. as an adult ive been diagnosed with manic depression, split personality disorder,body dysmorphic disorder and high anxiety. Sometimes i have a period of where i function and other times im just on auto pilot..

The reason im posting is because honestly im seeking reassurance.  

So i love kids, have a huge family.  But i know deep down i shouldn't have kids. Because im not emotionally stable or financially stable ( i have some savings but not enough to sustain a child).  Plus you have to have sex to reproduce lol..also with my bdd im scared of my body changing drastically and me resenting ""my child"". 

But a family friend who does know abit about my mental health was like "" oh you're 35 shouldn't you be having kids"". So i thought id be honest and express some days i can't get out of bed, feel suicidal and have no motivation.  What sort of life is that for a child..he responds  "" if you had a kid it would go away, you'd have to get out of bed etc"". Im like really.. wow. 

I look after my 67 yr old mother whos always been supportive active and independent until she got run over two years ago and sustained life changing injuries. My mother is my world. But then i think what if that happens to me, who would help me. But i would never have a kid just because of that.  That's selfish.  Id want ""my kids"" to live a full life, chase their dreams etc.plus just because you have a kid doesn't mean by default they will help you later in life. Shit I have a older sister my mother did everything for, paid for holidays. Helped when she had a drink problem, took care of her kids in her younger years.  My sister lives five mins away and doesn't even phone our mother. 

Im just scared when my mother isn't here who will i have. Im a introvert and don't make friends easily and my family have their immediate families to care for they dont need my shit..

So id like to hear from anyone and everyone who's cf, that life can be fulfilling and great without kids.

Dealing with Tokophobia,"Hi everyone, I’m new to this subreddit and I’m really happy I found this place because it feels like everyone I know is having kids and or jokingly saying that they’re excited for me to have kids. I’m 20. 

But I just wanna talk about tokophobia because I feel like there are times where it’s all I can think about. I always think I’m pregnant after I have sex, which is terrible. And my man always reassured me that I’m not but I just spiral down to convincing myself I’m pregnant. I buy pregnancy tests almost frequently to make sure I’m not pregnant.

Some instances I think about if I should make an abortion appointment. This usually happens when I’m extremely convinced that I’m pregnant. It’s terrible. It’s ruining my sex life. I love having sex but just the thought of there even being a possibility of me pregnant ruins it for me.

I guess this was more of a rant lmao but I just wanted to ask the people who have this, how do y’all cope with it? How do you improve your sex life despite having this?",childfree

That time I purposefully failed an exam,"A little more than 10 years ago I enrolled in an emergency services class (EMT-B iirc). It was a pretty long class that I attended every Monday and Thursday for theory (after school) and Saturday’s for practical. I was 18 at the time. 

Midway thru the class we get to the chapter on delivery. That day I found out that as an EMT, I was not certified to give someone an IV, or even administer most common drugs. But I would be certified to deliver a baby. 

The pictures in the textbook were not cartoons like in a high school health class book. No these were very graphic pictures of a real woman going thru childbirth. That week I sat at my desk with the book closed trying to ignore the lesson. On Saturday, we had to do a simulation birth for the practical, and it would be tested. 

When it came time for me to step up and demonstrate the procedure, I looked at the instructor and said, “I’m sorry, but you’re going to have to fail me. I can’t do a delivery.”

He asked me if I hadn’t studied. I said, “I studied. I know the theory.”

“So why can’t you demonstrate?”

“Because I have a phobia of pregnancy.”

He was actually pretty cool about it. He grilled me on a bunch of questions to confirm I had the theory down pat. But he didn’t force me to do the practical and he didn’t bingo me at all afterword. 

I don’t know if pregnancy phobia is a thing. But ever since I was super young, when I found out babies grow inside the mother, it’s grossed me out to the point I can’t physically look at pregnant women without feeling lightheaded and nauseous. When I found out my AP psych teacher was pregnant after walking into the first day of class, I told her I was sick and wanted to go to the nurse. Instead I went to my guidance counselor and switched out of her class.

Looking at a pregnant woman gives me flashes of Alien vs Predator. Babies in the womb are literally parasites that feed off their host with no benefit to the mother. I would rather break every bone in my arm than get pregnant. Someday I’ll post the story in this sub of the time in college I contracted PID and almost died in the hospital just to avoid getting pregnant. 

Babies are a hard no for me.

Guess why it ended...,"I just ended the best relationship I’ve ever been in. Before you nag, we didn’t have the deal breaker talk sooner because neither of us were wanting anything serious or with a long term future. The intimacy escalated, the word love was tossed around and we decided to have the talk. 

I didn’t quite get the bingos, but a lot of bingo adjacent questions. He is an amazing human being, but much more traditional than I was aware.  His job has him traveling often and/or working long hours. 

Because of this, any woman who would agree to marry and have kids with him wouldn’t end their career, but would chop it off at the knees. He could go weeks without seeing the kids in person, which means she is basically a single mother for that time. His working 6am to 8pm would mean that all child duties for that day would be up to her. 

I understand that millions of women make this choice each year. It works for them, their relationship and their family. They are happy with this (or so they tell themselves). But I would never be and the idea that this is seen more as an expectation than a choice is what I find the most upsetting. 

If we could switch places, I could see myself agreeing to have children. It’s not my body, I get to keep the career I worked so hard for, and 95% of the childcare (and household chores) is done by someone else. 

Men are so much more present in their family lives now  than ever before. I think that is wonderful! But there is still a subconscious allowance for men to not be as present or make as many sacrifices as a woman. I wish more men were aware of these sacrifices they are asking -expecting- of women when they say they want a family (looking at you, Don Draper!)",childfree
Married man that doesnt want kids.,"Hi,

I have grown to have an ""avoid at all costs"" mentality for kids (newborn to preteen.) For this reason I have decided to never have kids because I feel I cannot connect with one. I cant even hold a baby, make eye contact, or talk to a kid without cringing. 
I have told my wife I didnt want kids then I changed my mind and told her we would have one soon. The closer we get to the planned time to start trying the more and more fearful I get of losing my life essentially. I need my own time when I want my own time.
If I tell her I changed my mind back to the original no kids mindset she will definitely cry and lose her mind. She even said if I change my mind again she will leave me (jokingly though.) There is probably some seriousness behind it. I hate to see her cry, but I cant make a huge decision like that knowing it will make me miserable for at least 18 years.

I'm trying to get a minor surgery at the moment so I can have more job options I have gallstones so nothing life-threatening but my doctor agrees that they are probably what's been causing all this horrendous pain I've been in the last few years plus some mental health stuff but thasts a little harder to diagnose.

I'm lucky to have my sister still after almost losing her twice I love her but I'm a single 24-year-old woman that hasn't been on a date since highschool I'm not ready to have a kid on my hip 13 plus hours a day. I feel like theirs no one I can talk to even with my CF friend who I've been putting up a brave face for recently because I don't want her to worry. I've been watching this kid for free for a few months for free except a few twelve-packs of coke.

She offered to pay me 120 dollars a week plus provide all the baby supplies and I'm hurt and insulted by that but she is in way over her head just like I told her she would be. As it stands I spend significantly more time with this kid than either of his parents have (bio dad is out of the picture he was an abusive sack of crap anyway) and have taken better care of him to boot.

My parents are busy people and my grandmother tries to help. I feel bad about it since she only just started working and hasn't even gotten her first pay yet but I just don't know if I can put myself through this for 120 dollars a week I just can't. I have him at night when she works plus seven to nine hours in the day when she sleeps its 20 dollars a day regardless of how long I have him.

When your favorite movie protagonists have kids,"If they do, it more often than not happens at the end of the movie. After all the adventure and craziness has ended. But why END the movie with kids? Well, because kids are boring, of course. What, most people see it as a happy ending? Well, imagine this. Oh, Timmy McSorcerer, the most powerful sorcerer in the land is changing diapers now? Nobody wants a movie about that. Because face it, parenthood is disgusting, annoying, and makes for a boring movie more often than not. And definitely nobody on this sub wants to see their favorite movie character, capable of so many amazing things, throw everything that makes them special down the drain just to slave away for a dumb crotchfruit for the rest of their life. Whenever I see an awesome movie that ends with parenthood, I just feel disappointed. Like it led up to so much and now there's going to be nothing but poop and nursery rhymes. I can't fantasize about their next adventures, because I know there's only crotch goblins in their future and by the time they have enough free time again they'll have grey hair and creaky joints.

To kick this off, though, I would like to mention a movie that ended with parenthood that made sense. The hunger games. The characters in that movie had hellish lives, and after all the death and destruction, creating a new generation and filling it with hope seemed like a decent idea (if they wanted to of course), and felt honestly like a nice, relaxing, realistic conclusion after all the shit they went through.

Just a thought,"This is just an opinion, but I have never understood people who get pregnant and see it as an accomplishment. Or people who say they are proud of others for having a baby.

Like, why though? - not really a rant just an idea

Anyone can have kids (naturally, through in vitro, surrogacy, or adoption). Its an everyday occurrence and sometimes not done on purpose (obviously not adoption or invitro and such but you get the point).


The way I determine if something is an accomplishment is if a person can accidentally do something while drunk, than it is not an accomplishment.

Like anyone could easily get drunk, have sex, and wind up pregnant. Its alot harder to get drunk and accidentally build a spaceship.

Its also how I feel when I hear about someone  drunk driving and getting home alright. Sure you're alive and no one was harmed, but is it something you see has one of the highlights of your life?

Also, the idea of being proud that you were able to successfully get creamed with baby goo and have it stick long enough to turn into a baby waterballon sack is hysterical to me.

Broken statue apparently leads to... a child being cursed?,"I work at a very small locally owned magick shop in an equally small town. I've been working a few months now and absolutely love it so far! As you can probably imagine, we have quite a few breakables in our store.

We currently have no set rules against kids unfortunately, so I have to keep a close eye on them when they are in the shop. No biggie, usually it's quiet enough I can do that. Except today.

I was talking to a customer about a particular tarot set they were interested in, while there happened to be a family in the shop. It was just me at the time since we are a small team, so as I had my backed turned it was the perfect time for a toddler to attempt to pick up a heavy statue, fail, and knock it over so it breaks. 

So instead of logically apologizing and offering to pay for the broken merchandise, the mother loses it on me. Yes, me. Apparently since I carelessly left a heavy statue in the same area as her son it was my fault, and now he was going to get cursed or possessed. Please let this sink in, I still am trying to.

Her logic was that breaking this statue was going to upset some higher god or spirit and then take that anger out on her son. Okay.. I didn't know what to do in this situation because I wasn't following her reasoning at all, and I was alone. I spent the next half hour just trying to get her to leave.

Because I'm an ass and I know that I won't be a nice mother at all. I have 0 patience, 0 tolerance, anger issues, and a dependency on nicotine and caffeine so we can guess what would happen. I'd snap like a twig. 

Pregnancy is so beautiful, feeling a human growing inside you. I'm sorry but if that is beautiful to you then you need to watch alien and tell me if that is a beautiful movie. Oh what's that? I'm being dark and disturbing? Well you just told a woman who is actually terrified of pregnancy that a parasite moving around my internal organs is beautiful, so who's the dark one now? Not to mention that there is literally nothing beautiful about being a swollen mess for 9 months, should everything go according to textbook standards. But I have terrible luck so I know it would not go well.

What if you have a kid who cures cancer, well the odds of that are extremely low first off. Secondly I would have a greater chance of getting struck by lightning 6 times in my life time than I would of a child that comes out of my bits curing cancer. I actually would also have more of a chance to have a kid that is the next Ted Bundy, or Charles Manson than anything else. 

And the creme de la creme statement 

If you get pregnant, give me the baby, I would love another baby. In all honesty the first thing I would do is take my ass to a clinic to remove the thing. In no way shape or form would I allow myself to birth it. Plus the fact that I actually have P.C.O.S having a kid is extremely difficult without medical help which is in my opinion extremely selfish beyond anything else. Also the person who I'm talking to had a vasectomy so it would be a huge medical marvel. This comes from one of my close friends and she was ""scooped clean"" because she had a tumor.

Getting a vasectomy is being controlled?,"I just received a string of rants from my friend who said she was discussing permanent birth control options with her boyfriend.

She didn't tell him she wanted him to get an vasectomy (she's fine if he does or doesn't) but when she inquired into what they would do he said ""Well I'm not going to get snipped if that's what you're thinking. You might as well chop my balls off and put them in your purse. I'm not going to be controlled like that"". Of course it's his choice and she said she will get a tubal ligation if it comes down to it. I could get him getting angry and talking about being controlled if she was trying to make him do it after he said no, but that isn't the case here. I asked her if he wanted more kids after their planned one or two and she told me he said no. So it's just a matter of principle then. I asked her if he knew how much more dangerous it would be for her than him and she said he's mostly just concerned with not ""being controlled"". He also refuses to wear a condom because he also finds them to be ""controlling"" and ""stifling his manhood"". His words. Meanwhile my friend is currently dealing with TSS from her birth control.

What is her deal? I really dislike how everyone calls her so nice. I’m not understanding how that is a trait of someone who is nice. I have other things to back up that statement but they’d be off topic. Ughh!! “When you have more mouths to feed...” Next time I’m going to tell her: You don’t need to agree with us, not that this was ever any of your business, but you do need to be respectful.",childfree
"Coworker said I should ""totally have a child right now"".","So I (26f) was talking with some coworkers at coffee break and one of them (24f) started saying how she wanted to have children before her 30s and we started discussing some education stuff and so. 

Everything seemed fine when suddenly, same coworker said that she was jealous of me because I had the best stability of all at the office (doubt?) and that if she were me, she would get pregnant right away.

According to her I am the most suitable to have a child now for reasons that made no sense.

I disagree. 

First, I am literally the only single person at the office; I am working full time and studying at the same time, live on my own and have a dog, meaning I have little to no spare time. Apart from all that, I have some psychological issues going on.

How on earth could I be the most stable person to have a child right now?? Worst thing is I tried to explain the above reasons and she said those are not valid, like why not? I find them more than valid, plus, the single reason of not wanting to have children ever. 

I am really clueless about these breeders.",childfree
Annoying pregnant coworker,"I’m vocally CF so it’s not secret at work that I hate kids. I had a tubal last year. My coworker just got pregnant via IVF and all she does is complain about being pregnant... like stfu, you literally paid to have this happen. She’s only 4 weeks along. I’m already so annoyed. I also just went through a painful breakup and found out I need surgery for high grade dysplasia in my cervix. I literally just want to scream. 

Also, I hate when she points out all the kids my patients bring with them to their surgeries. I don’t care, and I don’t find them cute.",childfree
BiSalp update now that I’m not terribly high,"I had my procedure this past Friday.  Feel free to take a gander at my initial write up when I was blitzed on painkillers.  

Saturday was a sleepy, sleepy day.  I woke up with soreness and general discomfort.  There was some internal discomfort also.  I was smart enough to begin taking laxatives from the get-go so I didn’t break stride in the pooping department.  I can’t stress this enough.  Get the laxatives.  I took 1.5-2x the dose of miralax.  


Sunday I was able to go out grocery shopping.  One thing that I had not anticipated was how chill I was walking around in the madness that was a grocery store on a weekend.   Some pain.  Much less.  I would consider myself in pretty good shape and very active, but healing and recovery is absolutely no joke.  I was wiped out by 6pm.  

Monday was pretty sore but loads better.  I can’t wash my incisions with soap since they are glued.  No stitches.  I highly recommend dabbing the sites with a wet washcloth every few hours.  Keep them as dry as possible.  It’s really important to wipe and clean the dried blood away.  The bruising was at its peak on Monday for sure.   I found it sort of hard to sleep having slept during the day on Sunday so I went to the mall and walked for an hour (I’d be lying if I said I didn’t buy a few items at Lush Cosmetics because, girl, come on now).  I rode my stationary/assault bike for 30 minutes (very, very light and with no hands). I used some really light bands to get blood into my muscles.  Then so walked my dog for hour.   The takeaway here is that 2.5-3 hours of low to moderate activity didn’t seem to hurt me, but it definitely wore me out a ton.  

Today, I did some work from home for my job and school.  I did walk the dog for about an hour but I stayed the hell of the devil’s chariot because I know that I’d be tempted to do some intervals of some nature.   The walk and expending the mental energy was pretty exhausting - more so than you would imagine. I was tempted to go back to work tomorrow but an actual day in the office would be a bit much. 

So. 5 days post up:  bruising, definitely mobile, definitely needed at least 5 days off, can definitely do some exercise but it’s probably best not to, appetite sucks but I’m gettin in about 1800-2000 calories per day any way that I can, and maybe most importantly:  the swelling and bloating, which was mild to begin with, has all but subsided.  

Also, I stopped hormonal BC and this is the first time my endocrine system has been left to its own devices in terms of my estrogen, progesterone, LH, FSH and all that stuff.  I’ve been a bit moody but I otherwise haven’t noticed too much difference.   If the lack of ravenous appetite is a circumstance of ceasing the pill then I’m happy.

"""Life has a way of working things out"" - So mad, help me","I'm just so pissed off right now. I met this guy, who is a musician like me. We were just casually taking since our conversations just flowed effortlessly.

Today, our conversation went from hamsters eating babies to us discussing why I will never have a baby. I tried to just keep it straight cut, because I know how these conversations go, ""You'll change your mind!"" ""Maybe you'll meet the right guy and everything will magically change""

Sterilization questions,"I do not know if this is allowed.

I am hoping to get sterilized soon (female). I have a new patient appointment scheduled at a location that is on the childfree friendly doctors list.

Does anybody here know what the costs are for it? My old insurance said sterilization was covered completely as preventative care, but I switched jobs before I could do it. And a friend said there might be hidden costs? Is it considered preventative care to all insurances? I am in oregon if that makes a difference.

"Don’t touch me, don’t talk to me, don’t even breathe in my general direction.","Didn’t know what to flare this as but whatever. 

I am a massive introvert with a heaping helping of social anxiety and a side of mild hatred toward humanity. So as you can imagine, I like neither children nor adults. The heading is my general mood whenever I leave my apartment to do stuff in public places. 

I recently discovered *yet another* reason (among a list of infinite reasons) I’m childfree. I would freaking despise the attention I’d get while pregnant. I’ve seen it everywhere. People just walk up to a pregnant woman, put their hand on her belly without warning, ***then ask the most invasive questions.*** And the people who are polite enough not to touch or talk to the woman still freaking gawk at her like she has an alien bursting through her abdomen. 

I mustn’t forget to mention the unsolicited advice from ***everyone*** who’s held a baby once and now thinks they know freaking everything in the dog damned universe and believe they must bestow their knowledge upon you. 

If I (dog forbid) decided to be purposefully pregnant, I’d never leave my home for the entirety of my pregnancy and the first 10 years of the child’s life. I don’t want people touching me or asking me if I’ve done my birthing exercises or if I’m lactating yet. I would be so overwhelmed and hormonal I’d just be crying 24/7 and would likely end up dehydrated and having constant panic attacks.

Extreme fear of pregnancy,"Ever since I was a teen, I've been ridiculously afraid of pregnancy. For example, there was one occasion where I feared I had became pregnant. I had made out with a boy. Both of us had all our clothes on. I am not kidding; I was scared that semen had came through the hole in my jeans and made me pregnant. I was not uninformed. Thankfully, we had decent sex ed where I lived and I knew how pregnancy worked. Logically, I knew my fear was stupid and impossible. Unfortunately, fears don't care about facts. It took me way to long to realize I was being ridiculous. 

This carried on into adulthood. I cannot begin to tell you about how many pregnancy tests I have wasted. The only reason I'm not stressing about it now is because I haven't had sex in years.

A story of evil...,"I’m sure I’ve mentioned this story in bits and pieces more than a few times here, and finally decided y’all would enjoy the full tale. 

When I lived in Tampa Bay, I began working at a call center which did CS/Sales and QA for a large number of sex chat lines and a psychic network. There were some interesting characters working there, and yes, it’s as sketchy as it sounds. I have hours and hours of stories to share that are totally off topic here. 

We had communal desks. Policy was that personal items weren’t exactly unwelcome but you needed to take them home or store them in the filing cabinets under the desks when your shift was over. 

There was a mom there who just had to put up pictures of her kids (this is pre-smartphone), which was fine with me. But she left them up more times then she took them down, and so I had to frequently declutter the desk so I might have some room to read or draw between calls (I worked for the psychic line side and it was new and we often went 10+minutes between calls). 

This new rep sees me putting up the mom’s pics one day as we’re starting our shift. (I’m paraphrasing the conversation as it was over ten years ago.)

New Rep: Why are you putting up her pictures?

Me: I don’t want them here. 

NR: Why?

Me: They aren’t my kids. Plus, it takes up a lot of room and I want space. 

NR: But they’re pictures of KIDS!
Me: Okay, so?

NR: So you should leave them alone! What’s your deal, anyway, don’t you have kids?

Now, had I been older and wiser, I would have deflected at this point or changed the subject. But I wasn’t...

Me: No. I don’t have kids. I don’t want them. 

NR: -horrified- What? Oh my god! You’re kidding, right?
Me: No. 

NR: Wow. You’re evil. Like pure evil. 

Me: I’m evil because I don’t want kids?

NR: Yeah! -said like I’m an idiot- 

Me: That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, and you’re crazy. 

We didn’t speak much after that. Thankfully, this went nowhere (our HR department was a joke and the head of it was a known alcoholic with a coke problem) and she was back to regaling me with tales of her time as a literal prostitute pre-children within a couple of days. 

Ironic part? The mom and I eventually became good friends and her kids loved me and I loved them. But I didn’t really know her then. I still didn’t leave the pics up even when we were more friendly though and she totally understood.

"Trying to get through NSisters ""pregnancy"" without losing my mind (longish)","My older sister (late 20s, we'll call her HS for HellSpawn) is a narcissistic asshole who needs to be in control of everything, and doesn't care who she physically or emotionally hurts to get her way. 

When our brother/SIL had their kid (1st grandkid), she told SIL straight to her face that ""[niece] called me mom today. She loves me more than you!"" And while I'm sure we can all agree not a lot of people on this sub gives a crap about that stuff, it was important to my SIL and she left crying because she honestly believed she was a shitty parent because of my sister. 

Fast forward to present day, and HS goes against everything our niece's parents set for her. Doctor said niece cant have sugar due to health problems, guess what HS is feeding her? Candy like its Halloween. HS is encouraging hitting and telling people to shut up (a big no in our family due to past abuse to multiple relatives)

Anyway, a few months ago, HS announces shes pregnant! And I think she literally sucked the soul from me when she announced it. Our mum told me she hopes that pregnancy will change her, and I just pointed out the multiple (given, worse case) scenarios of parents who never changed their ways. Being a parent doesnt magically fix things. If anything, it makes people like her worse!

And it's already showing. She suddenly cant do basic things because shes ""pregnant"". Her attitude towards our niece (the only child we're around so shes the only example) has gotten worse to the point where she smacked our nieces hands when she tried touching something she was told not to But mind you, HS is the one who taught her to be ornery. She even told niece (who is barely 3) that she ""cant act that way since theres going to be other children around soon.""

Maybe you're wondering why pregnant is in quotes, it's because I dont think shes actually pregnant! She announced her pregnancy a week after our cousin who- while I hate the term- has a miracle baby. Her and her husband accepted they would never have kids due to health concerns, but they are happy either way. They got soooooo much attention from it, and HS couldn't handle it, honestly. It was a topic of conversation every day for her but not in a good way, she was shit talking them every chance she could get. I think it's suspicious that shes suddenly pregnant, and her ""morning sickness"" is never witnessed by the 5 people living in the house with her. And based on past experiences, she's the type of person who let's everyone know she's sick. She also wont let anyone (husband included) go to the doctor appointments. 

The worst part of it all is that she still lives with our parents, is planning on quitting her job 5 months earlier than her ""due date"", and just be a SAHM, and possibly homeschool our niece (which brother/SIL already laughed in her face about and told her no. To which she replied with, ""we'll see."" With a weird smirk.)
So to recap.. shes married at basically 30, got pregnant while living at home, with no money saved, quitting her job to be a SAHM and have essentially our parents support her, because I honestly have no idea what her husband is doing!

33 f 33 m contemplating a childfree existence,"Recently me (33 f) and my partner (33 m) were rehashing the possibility of a childfree existence. We are both from pushy meditteran cultures who keep asking ""when will you have kids?!"" Sigh!

We were both on the fence for a while but as we both grow older and enjoy our freedom it's become clear that not having kids is a real possibility and even, preference.

We have decided to not think about it for 2 years and concentrate on us. Because a) we definitively do not want them now and b) possibly MAY want them later, but still aren't sure.

I'm increasingly aware that my fertility window is closing and I'm not panicked I'm relieved. I secretly started to feel hope that my partner will also eventually lean toward not having them at all, but I want him to come to his genuine conclusion and not have a forced dialogue. 

I'm about 70% no kids at all right now and 30% MAYBE in the future. I am sorry this post is so random and wordy, I'm just trying to figure this whole thing out. Who knew I'd get to 33 and still not want kids? Me, apparently. Cause from childhood I was never sure if I'd want them, even though I'm good with them. I think my role as eldest sibling of 4 played a role, plus being raised in a chaotic daycare home with 5 to 7 children in our house 6 days a week! My eyes are wide open re the reality of parenting.

Potential family questions,"I have a largeish extended family. About 16 first cousins. All of the girls, expect me, have had children in the late teens to early  twenties. I’m the youngest girl so I saw it all at a pretty young age. I would say for the most part they’re all happy. It’s not really for me to judge and not why I’m here. Over time some of the guys have had kids. Even though some of them used to comment how only the girls got pregnant so easily. That really bothered me. 

Anyway I’m 28 now married and child free. We’ll be visiting for the holidays next month. If for any reason the conversation comes up I don’t want to get defensive. Their decisions are theirs. I don’t dislike kids I actually work with them. It’s just not for us. It’d be one thing if I knew my family wouldn’t hound me with the why’s. I know my family and they will. I work with young children. Surely I want them. Is it my husband? I can change his mind. 

I think too because everyone knows I like children and my husband doesn’t. He really does have an aversion to them. I work in a preschool I can tune them out for the most part. Planes, restaurants, stores, really anywhere public. My husband on the other hand can see a kid in public and I can hear the sigh before it happens. I don’t care that he doesn’t like kids and he does fine around my family even though it can get chaotic at times. Huge kudos to him. His family doesn’t have any kids. None yet, and I don’t know if they will. I don’t want them to put any pressure on him. I don’t want him to be blamed for something that is our decision. I guess this is my relationship and I shouldn’t have to justify it to anyone. I also to love my family and don’t want to be abrasive in why we don’t want kids. More of a rant but if anyone has any tips that could be helpful I would appreciate it. 

Also I guess I should add the thought of being pregnant is disgusting to me. It’s the last thing I would ever want to do. My husband and I love to travel. Though we do feel guilty about the carbon footprint that brings. Given that, not having a child could offset that. Idk all the science behind having children and the damage it can do climate wise.

Hypocrisy in the church because bAbIEs!,"Fiance and I were discussing who we would like to perform our wedding ceremony.  I brought up my parents' pastor because I like him, he was always kind to fiance and me, and he's all around a good man.

I mentioned the idea to my mother, who is very closed off and conservative when it comes to sex.  She said immediately ""He (Pastor) won't marry people who are living together.""

My mother and the religious community in which I was raised believe the *only* reason people live together is so they can have sex.

Yes, fiance and I plan on living together.  Yes, we have sex.  Here's the real problem - their church clearly doesn't care about that if there's a prospective child involved.

I shit you not.  A few months before my mother slashed the idea of their pastor marrying us, she went to a baby/bridal shower combo.  I asked, at the time, if they were for sisters or something - two different parties for two different people but held at the same time.

No.

Same woman.  She got knocked up and was living with the fetus' daddy.  Where were they getting married?  The church.  Who was performing the ceremony?  My parents' pastor.

So yes, it is perfectly fine to have sex with someone before marrying them, but only if you're creating a possible infant when you do so.

"MIL: ""I still have hope that you two will give us one grandkid.""","My husband and I got dinner with his parents this weekend. They've always been super welcoming and kind towards me, but I know they were both disappointed when we told them we're planning on not having children. 

My husband made some kind of joke about having kids and my mother in-law said **""Don't say that. I still have hope that you two will give us one grandkid""** or something along those lines. 

Which just really ignited anger in me. Anger at my husband for bringing up a topic that I've asked him not to bring up, repeatedly. Anger that his mom doesn't accept our choice. And just frustration that ""we'd"" be giving her a grandkid. Genetically, sure. But, hypothetically,  I'd get pregnant, I'd have to make a ton of sacrifices (professionally and personally), I'd forever be changed physically. My husband would have to support me, but beyond that, nothing really. Just donate his baby-juice to the cause. That's all. And the fact that they were talking about it like I wasn't even there, just makes me want to rage even more. 

It made me feel like they won't ever fully accept me because I don't want to live to the traditional life script. I have this belief that they think I'm taking away some big life experience away from their son. Which is sorta true, since my husband has said if he met another woman, and she wanted kids, he would've been fine being a father. But since he met me, and fell in love with me, he's CF. And I told him before we got married, if he wants to be a father, to leave and go find someone else. 

So I'm frustrated. Mostly at my husband for willingly bringing up such a tense topic, with people who don't have the ability to handle the nuance of the topic.

My favorite one, though, was where I was at a brewery with my husband. In the dream canon, I had a baby with an ex and broke up with him. His new girlfriend came up to us with the baby in a carrier, asking me if it was OK for her to take him on vacation, asking me about his 1st birthday party, etc. She was extremely nice but I shrugged her off and said ""Sure, whatever, quit asking me about baby stuff."" I shooed her away and continued to drink 😵 I'm almost embarrassed by my extreme deadbeat behavior but that's why I'm avoiding putting a kid in that situation IRL in the first place. 

Have you ever had these dreams, and if so how'd they go?",childfree
Not actually childfree?,"Never been that interested in kids, but I only started identifying as childfree around the age of 22. Currently 28 and i've been having more in-depth thoughts about my stance/identity. Basically, I would NEVER EVER have biological children. I have no patience for babies, major health issues in my family and pregnancy is just a hell no from me.

Over the last few years my work has been taking on high school co-op students who are interested in my career field. A lot of them are nervous, a little awkward and never had a job before. I super sympathize with them as I was extremely socially awkward when I left school to start working. I'm finding I love mentoring them and helping them develop confidence working in our office.

Anyway it got me thinking about adoption. Definitely not for now or anytime soon, as I'm not financially stable. If I ever got into a stable place, I'd love to share my good fortune and help a young person navigate this crazy society and just provide support. My SO is on the same page. His dad is not his bio dad, but adopted him. He would like to pay it forward one day if that's how things pan out. However, we'd still be completely satisfied if that never worked out financially.

Does that mean we should just consider ourselves childless, not childfree? Either way, I really enjoy this community, you guys are awesome and I would keep on lurking here as I do.",childfree

"""The pleasure of giving birth""","So recently I've been getting those classic bingo cards from my father, He's the kind of guy that thinks there's no greater pleasure than having kids, and giving birth to them (he even said he wants a female dog just so he could make her have puppies, and I fricking quote ""it would be cruel not to let her have that experience"") He always said that line ""you'll never know real love until you have kids.""

But the thing about my dad is he's a shitty dad, I parent him all the time, I whip him into shape, I kick him up the arse when he's rude to people (always have done since I was very fricking young) I mean just the other day he was lippy to a police officer and I had to apologise for him profusely.  He was never even there for me as a kid, that was my mum's burden. Jeez, I'm even sure I was a 'fix it' baby.

I'm just so sick of being bingoed by a man who doesn’t even know what being a father is, or what it's like to give birth. I'm shit scared of the very idea of squeezing a whole melon out of my cooch. I'd literally rather swallow a bag of knitting needles.

Usually, when he brings up the baby talk I just cut him off and say ""yeah sure. Anyway-"" that kind of thing. I don't hate children, but I'm never going to have any of my own. I prefer my furbabies thanks.

I think pregnancy addiction is a legitimate thing,"I think it literally is like a drug for some women.  They might get a dopamine rush doing this shit.  That's why you see some women constantly STAY pregnant with hardly any breaks in between children.

[long] I keep being pressed to have kids because I'm Latina.,"Oh my God where do I even start?

Many Hispanics and Latinos are Catholic and don't believe in abortion. My mom had 5 kids and our family is huge! Watching her as I was growing up, I always knew that I never wanted kids.

I moved out of state about a year ago. I live with my boyfriend, his parents, his sister +her 3 kids.

What a nightmare it's become. My boyfriend's sister, Maria is 35F with 3 kids. Since I've moved in, she's been on me about having kids. She talks about how I'm good with kids, how cute they'd be, and whatnot. But, when she's drunk or frustrated she tells me not to have kids. I think she just wants someone to be miserable with.

She brings up children *constantly*

My boyfriend's family knows I don't want kids because of the millions of times I've said it. But still, they press on. Here's how bad it got the other day:

On Sunday we had a family get together and people were invited. Maria casually brought up that that her nephew- 4M is the only boy in the family that will be able to pass down the family name because her kids have their father's name. So Maria looks at me and says, ""Unless Aztec-goddess has kids!"" and everyone looked right at me as if I was going to save their family name. 

""Sorry I'm not having kids,"" 

She proceeded to try and convince me but I walked away to help with the dishes so I could escape her. 

Later on, Maria was a bit drunk and walked into the kitchen as I was helping MIL clean up. Oh boy, she made it worse. Maria brings up her late brother that passed ~3 years back and how he never had a chance to have kids and I was the last one in the family. She said to me, "" I know you don't want children but you could give it to us and we could raise it."" 

UM WHAT?

Since Maria brought up her deceased brother, MIL was emotional and totally on board with that idea. MIL looked me in the eye and with the most serious tone says, ""You don't even have to raise it, just give it to me and I'll raise your baby.""

U wot m8?

Anyways, I deflected the conversation by saying I want a career and I want to travel. FFS I'm only 21!
They make it seem like I'm the crazy one!

"He can't be late for school, but it's fine if we're all late for work","So I was at the train station on my way to work the other day, and, as usual, there was a massive queue due to half the ticket windows being unmanned. Policies changed a little while back so that you can't board the train and buy a ticket from a guard - You have to buy a ticket before boarding. If you don't, they charge you a fine. Not all of the guards enforce it all the time, but those are officially the rules, and I've heard some guards sternly lecturing people that they would have had time to buy a ticket if they'd turned up earlier (They also would have had time to buy a ticket if two of the three ticket machines weren't broken while the ticket window was closed.)

So I'm standing in the queue, knowing full well that I'm going to miss my train, when a guy behind me asks one of the guards if she can let his 13-ish year old son through the barriers, because he's going to miss his train to school if he queues for a ticket.

*She let him through.*

A bunch of people just turned around and glared. Here we were obeying the rules and paying for our overpriced tickets, and a kid was waved onto the train without having to buy one, because otherwise he'd be late (unlike the rest of us, apparently.)",childfree
"For anybody who needs it, here’s my experience with abortion.","I was 19. I’m 23 now. My bf and I were dumb teens who used the calendar/pull out method.

So I was pregnant. Five weeks along. Luckily we had already had the talk about what would happen if I got pregnant beforehand, and I insisted I would get an abortion. For all the guys out there: my bf says that looking back, he put way too much trust into me (but is thankful that I didn’t misplace it) and would take extra precautions next time.

So, I looked online at my options. I saw an option for a surgical abortion and one for a medical abortion (I.e. you clear your day and take a pill.) We went to planned parenthood. This might not be the same at every PP, but the one I was at offered only the medical option. So we signed up for an appointment.

Later that night, the bf woke up to me googling medical abortion. I heard accounts from girls who described it as the worst pain they’d ever felt, and I was scared. The bf offered me a drink and some weed, and I said I wanted to do the surgery instead. The next day we found a place that does surgical abortions near us and booked and appointment.

By the way, we live in Atlanta. So the suite was in Atlanta.

A week later, we walked into the surgical suite at around 11:00 a.m. The pamphlet from
the office had warned us about protestors and told us not to engage if we saw any, but we didn’t, probably because this was just in a backwoods office suite. They had instructed me not to eat or drink anything the day of. The day was just waiting for appointments. I don’t remember the exact order of things, but I know I had to fill out forms, get a sonogram, get a little counseling, talk with somebody about money (it cost around $600....) the whole day was a blur, a LOT of time in the waiting room, and I was very bored and hangry. By the way: bring something to do. I wasn’t necessarily scared, but it was SO BORING. 

The day grew later, and the windows darkened with night. I was one of the last ones they called back for the actual surgery. They gave me a gown and led me into a little room where there were other girls waiting. We stared at the TV. Nobody touched the magazines. Finally somebody asked a question, and we started talking about our situations.

By the way: I’ve tried not to get too much into personal details as not to clog up this account (though I’ll happily answer any further questions about my situation in the comments,) but after listening to a lot of those girls, I have to commend my bf here. He’s a trouper. A lot of girls didn’t have decent people in their lives as the “fathers,” much less a bf who stayed throughout the entire day with them. My bf has a lot of flaws, but he really pulled through for me on this occasion, and it was nice to have somebody in my corner of the ring.

Anyway, eventually I was called back. They put me under anesthesia, and I looked at the butterfly stickers on the ceiling. Then I woke up. I was quite loopy from the drugs and asked where my bf was, asked if I could see him, and fell asleep. Three times. Then they gave me saltines (first thing I’d eaten all day and it was like 8 p.m.) and sat me next to another girl to recover. She started crying about how unfair it was to the fetus and that they didn’t get a choice. I told her there were some situations where it’s better to not exist. Maybe that was the right thing to say. Maybe it wasn’t. I dunno.

Anyway, I reunited with my bf and he drove us home. They have to make sure you have a ride home because you’ll still be loopy, so if you don’t have an awesome bf like me, get a trusted friend or family member or pony up for an Uber.

So we went back to the bf’s house. The bf set me up in bed and made me Panera Mac and cheese, and I watched The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.

Then I got an IUD. And that, so far, is the end of it.",childfree
Pregnancy scare,"I'm about to take a pregnancy test for the first time. Usually I'd go to my boyfriend for support but he's away from his phone at the minute, so I had to come here.

I'm literally terrified. I've been horrified and disgusted by the idea of being pregnant since I was small, and now I've been having nausea and throwing up occasionally for 5 days. We always use protection but I know things like this can happen. 

My parents are pro-choice so I can get an abortion if I need one, but I'll have to travel to another country . Not to mention keeping it a secret. I know I haven't even taken the test yet so I shouldn't be over thinking it like this but I just can't help it.

My (23F) stepmother (47F) won’t stop “joking” that she’s going to make me get pregnant — how do I respond?,"We’ve always had an antagonistic relationship and don’t have even remotely similar personalities. I’m reserved and rather “quirky” (ex: liberal arts degree, dresses weird, likes painting and writing) and she’s very Good Christian Midwestern Mother™️ who doesn’t go to church but likes to post bible quotes on Facebook like she does.

ANYWAYS my boyfriend is a great guy. I was upfront from day one I didn’t want kids because it interferes with my plan in life. I also think I’m kinda selfish and have my host of own issues so, knowing what it was like to be neglected and abused as a kid, it’s just better if I don’t. He likes outdoorsy things like ice climbing and huge trail hikes in the wilderness (and kids definitely don’t vibe with that) so he’s onboard. 

Every time we see her at either dinners or when I show up at my siblings’ events in the area (my Bf and I live in our own place about an hour away from them) she jokes that it’s “just a matter of time” until “something happens” and that “god works in mysterious ways.” I always tell her it’s none of her business and we’re happy being child free, thank you. 

Recently though, she’s been upping the ante and “jokingly” threatening to flush my birth control or sabotage our condoms and I honestly??? I don’t know how to even begin to respond. She and my  father were in town the other night and in front of him she told me and my boyfriend that she’d poke holes in our condoms before we left “with the back of her earrings and it’s not even like we’d be able to tell.”

I was so repulsed that someone would even think about doing that I didn’t even know how to respond. My dad just sat there and drank his beer because he’s a spineless coward but thankfully my boyfriend was quick to joke back “well I guess we just better throw out the whole box when you leave and get new ones then just to make sure, huh? Last thing we’d want to do is have a Planned Parenthood visit on our hands.”

She sat there the rest of the night acting like we mortally offended her. My dad texted me later that I should apologize to her because “she was just joking and you guys didn’t need to make it so serious” and that “killing babies is disgusting to joke about.”

Oh I’m sorry but it’s totally cool to make light of forcefully impregnating your adult daughter against her will then? Cool.

Some small humor from yesterday at work...,"So I've been lurking on this thread, but something short and funny happened to me yesterday. 

I work in a tattoo shop, but we don't have a hard 18+ rule since most of the time kids are accompanied and not left alone by our clients. A girl with her family (mom, dad, little brother about 7) came in and she got a piercing signed for. Now, I crack jokes and try to get people to feel comfortable most of the time since getting piercings can make people nervous at first. 

Did my spiel, got everything done, and was checking them out at the desk. The mom was nice enough to throw me a little cash tip, and the little brother sticks his arm through a gap in the desks and tells me 'I can take that'. I just kinda look at him and he repeats, 'I can take the money'.

I actually laughed out loud and replied, 'No you can't! This is mine. I did the work, you just stood there and watched!'. This was in a joking voice, but the kid stared at me like he couldn't tell if I was serious before just wandering off to the troupe with a befuddled expression. Sure, mom didn't laugh, but I thought it was funny.

They had this ice queen or princess or whatever role that was rounded off by being called 'mysterious and knowledgeable about the maze'. Half customer service, half character, sounded like a decent starting point to me. 

I thought about the pros and cons for a whole day and as last night was wrapping up I finally decided 'fuck it, I'll try!' then, it hit me.

Describe what tokophobia is like for you.,"I believe myself to be tokophobic- I know  I’d probably try to kill myself if I ever did fall pregnant. It wouldn’t matter if I’m married and financially stable or not. I’d have to say it’s my greatest fear.

Or if he is Christian like myself and decides to wait until marriage, I’d have to reject his proposal.

"Do you notice people change, too?","When I was little I always thought I would be married with a house and kid(s) someday in my mid 20's or so.

BFs came, BFs went, I would have had the chance to start this life if I really wanted to. Sometimes I compare kids to a driver's licence because you're supposed to have one but for me the moment where I WANTED one never came. But the realisation came. I don't have to, just because seemingly I'm supposed to. 

My sister was sad. She has a son but really wants to be an aunt, too. My aunt, my mom, my sister and my grandma (basically all women in my family) were like ""Uhm, ofc yeah it is your choice but we'll just wait and watch you change your mind at some point (we may or may not even say 'told you so'.)"". Years have passed, minds have stayed unchanged, children were born all around me but (luckily) not for me. I watch people. I watch parents. I watch them suffer sleeplessly and worn out. I watch them spend money they don't have for their kids. I watch them cheat because the love has long gone from their home but ""we have to stay together for the kids"".

And I don't plan to do that to myself.

Nowadays it happens moreoften that in a quiet moment between the shrieks and the goblin-like laughter and the demands of attention, when all people including the kids have left the room and there is only one parent and me left.. They qietly say: ""Don't ever get kids, you hear?""

And I answer: ""I don't plan to.""

Or when I can't bear the child that I am supposed to ""surrogate love"" because he is my nephew and I'm his godmother and I sneak away for a moment to text my mom ""Thank you for not drowning us when we were kids! &lt;3"" And her answer is nothing like ""Yeah I would have missed out on something"" but: ""Yeah I'm glad too. I wouldn't have made it in prison very long.""

So many thoughts on this...hear me out.,"Thirty something female here. Happily married. Husband is active duty military. 

Last job I worked, I was called in on all (not an exaggeration) my days off because the other girl had issues with childcare. I was super understanding. Always came in. The second our oldest dog had a seizure and I needed to take her to the ER vet, I lost my job. Funny how that works, right?

Again, husband is active duty. Women who get pregnant in the military get 3-4 months off. Understandable. But that means everyone has to pick up the slack. They’re all understandable about this, though. The father of the newly born child gets six weeks off. And they’re paid for it. Meanwhile, my husband wasn’t able to take his father to a chemo treatment several years back because it wasn’t an emergency. Just one day for this was all he asked. 

I have so many thoughts on how our lives would be so much better if we had children. Then I remind myself the money we have tucked away. The savings we have. The ability to get a full nights sleep. I’m not saying parents don’t have it hard and I’m not saying that having children isn’t  rewarding - but why should we be punished for not having children? 

Don’t get me started on how hard it’s been to make friends being a military spouse and not having kids. The women you do meet start to nonchalantly slide it into conversations that since you don’t have kids, I have free time to watch kids...just angers me. 

Maybe it’s just Tuesday getting under my skin. Or maybe I’m just fed up with stereotypes.

Mom doesn't believe me when I tell her I don't want kids.,"I got a dysfunctional family with parents that, all be it were physically there (lived together and provided things like school, food and shelter) for my siblings and I, it still wasn't a healthy environment, emotionally.

They basically hated each other and stayed for us but made us pick sides. My siblings and I have all suffered one way or another.

My older sister rebelled pretty early (around 15) messed up her life by making a bunch of poor choices over and over again. So now she has a baby while her life still isn't sorted yet. (We had a falling out cause she's always dragging me in her problems and I had enough)

My younger brother was super spoiled as a baby and had no disciple. And now that he's a bit older, he's rude and can be disrespectful at times.

Having this responsibility scares the shit out of me, and although I won't abandon my brother, it can be really hard sometimes.

Strange Curiosity,"So I've always found this thought weird and so I wanted to get the opinion of the other guys in this group to see if this thought has ever crossed their mind as well. 

So you meet a girl and you fall in love with her because she is everything you desire in a women, you get along and everything is fine. And you get used to her and her quirks and everything is cool. You get so comfortable with her in fact that you start knowing what she is thinking before she says it because you both share the same vibe.  

So then she gets pregnant, her hormones go all wacky and with it all of her priorities change. So in essence the child changes who she is as a person fundamentally. It changes her wants, her needs and her priorities.

So at that point could you honestly say that as a person you were still in love with her? Because to me it would be no different then dating someone new. She'll never go back to who she was even if the kid grows and leaves the house. As the chemical releases in her brain have shifted her priorities and her perspectives.  

I used to know a lot of great girls growing up, and watched a lot of them change drastically into people I don't recognize after spitting out a kid or two. It's as if they are hollowed out versions of themselves. I've know maybe three total that didn't 180 flip their entire life once they had kids.  

Am I the only person that runs into this issue. It's gotten to the point if a girl tells me she want to have kids some day I won't even bother starting a friendship with them as I got tired of watching it happen.",childfree
Iud vs bi slap,Hello! I am a long time lurker but have never posted. I know I never want kids. Due to my hatred and very severe health and mental health issues. I currently have a  hormonal iud and it is working great but I was wondering if it would be worth trying to get my tubes tied. I am a 22 so probably would get told no lots but worth a try. I was wondering if you still get your period after getting it done. I have read mixed reports on line and am looking for some personal experiences. Thank you 😊,childfree
My FWB I’ve been on and off with depending on if I get serious with someone else just told me tonight that he doesn’t want kids either and now I’m having second thoughts about his FWB status.,"Firstly: sorry this is long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Now, I’ve had several FWB and boyfriends (and one crazy af girlfriend) over the past year and I’ve known this guy since April. I adore him. He’s funny, we like the same shows, music, food, games, and activities. We can have sex and then play Magic the Gathering or some days we hike and then eat Taco Bell in his car because we both feel too sweaty and gross to fuck but enjoy one another’s company. He’s honestly like a good friend I can get really satisfying sex from and that kind of all he’s really been. He’s not the greatest fuck I’ve ever had, but he makes sure I’m satisfied, which is good enough for me. 

He’s 23, has a car, and still lives with his mom and dad because he’s unemployed (he’s going for a master’s and is working on getting his application ready because he graduated this year, so it’s not like he’s just bumming, he’s just trying to get accepted into his program, but still). I honestly hadn’t really considered him marriage or dating material because I thought he’d want kids and due to his living situation and the fact that “his” money is really his mother’s money at the moment but now that I know he doesn’t want children I don’t really care?

Like... I don’t want kids and most of the guys I seriously date don’t either, it’s literally the main appeal. However, I have my own house, my own car, I have a job and go to school full time. I pay my own bills (except insurance and phone bills) so the guys I prefer are older, more established men. I don’t mind dating guys my age (19) but tire quickly of them needing their mother’s permission to even go out at night with me. The biggest barrier I find with older guys is that they enjoy drinking and going out to places that card. Which... obviously... I can’t do (even if I WAS 21 I wouldn’t meet a guy for drinks on the first date, I’m not out to get murdered). Even then, though, most of the men don’t really care because we can just go to their house for a few drinks once I make sure they’re not a freaking serial killer lmao. (Whiskey spreads my legs faster than it honestly should.)

But now that I know he’s childfree I kinda want to date him seriously. He isn’t as well established as me or the normal men I date, but not wanting kids is so rare and we get along so well. In all honesty my only issue is that because he lives with his parents he has a curfew and will get scolded if he breaks it. Like tonight. His curfew was midnight and I had him out a little bit later so I know - and feel bad - that he probably got yelled at by his mom when he got home. I also like sleeping over/having sleep overs. I don’t know how he’d get his religious parents to agree to a sleep over and it irritates the fuck out of me just thinking about the headache. I’d just want to wake up to his face, you know? Have a little morning sex, make him some breakfast because he most likely made me dinner (he cooks really well). 

Ugh. I’m torn because he’s great but he’s got the problem that irritates me the most: living with your parents. What do I do???

TLDR: my FWB is a great guy I get along with and have satisfying sex with. I’ve been on and off with him this year since April. I’d thought he wanted children but today he mentioned he didn’t want kids and it made me think we could be more. The issue is he’s not like the guys I usually date because he’s unemployed and living with his parents, unlike me who has my own house and works to pay my own bills. What do I do? Would it be smart to seriously date him?",childfree
"Storytime- Don't know if it was my lesson to deliver, but it was one to be heard","I just remembered this recently, after having spent a bit of time binging this subreddit. It's kind of a long story, and I'm a bit of an asshole in it, but I feel it's worth a share. :)

This happened about two, two and a half years ago. I (F 23 at the time) was flying home after a very long and exhausting time overseas. I was looking at a 13 hour redeye flight with an hour, hour and a half long layover in the middle and a four hour drive after (don't worry, my dad was going to drive me), and after not having slept a wink the whole previous night, all I had had that morning was a lukewarm coffee from Tim Horton's and a soggy doughnut (with the person I had just broken up with after three years so that was fun), so I was hungry, exhausted physically and emotionally, and just so very homesick. An airplane dinner and hopefully a nap was pretty much all I had to look forward to in my foreseeable future.

When I boarded my flight that would take me all the way home, I got seated in the middle row, next to the aisle, and on my right was a kid of about 5-ish years (really bad at telling a kid's age so... between 3 and 6 is a safe bet?) in the middle, and his mother on the kid's other side.

This kid... was a nightmare.

It started with a small kick, barely noticeable, to my knee. I looked at the kid, shifted farther from him, and left it at that.

Then it was a whack to the arm. Another kick. A fist to the bicep. An elbow to the ribs. Slowly getting more deliberate and aggressive, and the mother didn't even seem to give a shit.

The first few times, I ignored it. Then, I said ""that's not nice, please stop that"" to the kid, to no effect. After about half an hour, I tried to get the mother's attention and let her know, or ask her to switch seats with her kid. She just said ""oh, he'll stop eventually, don't mind him"". I'm like, okay, cool, I'll just keep my bruises company then. No biggie.

Anyway, I wasn't looking for a confrontation, and frankly I just wanted to see my parents after only having skyped with them for a long time, so I didn't push. Until the food, the first warm meal I had had in two days at that point, came.

And just as I took my first blessed bite, the kid decided that it would be a great idea to throw his toy into my food, and knock my tray onto the floor of the isle.

I didn't throw a fit. I felt like crying honestly, but I just took a big breath, turned to this fucking menace of a child, leaned into his space, and said ***""I am not your mother. I don't have to care about you.""***

I admit that those words coming out of my mouth and the venom in my voice surprised me most of all (I was about ready to punch this kid's lights out, and I'm pretty sure it showed- my mom jokingly calls that look my ""pitchfork-eyes""), and that was when the kid started crying. And the mother, finally doing something vis-à-vis her crotchgoblin, FLIPPED her SHIT. At how dare I say something like this to her precious baby, which was now wailing as if I had hit the damn thing. Just fucking ballistic, screaming, crying, throwing himself to the ground in a tantrum, and the mother was more concerned with lecturing me than she was with her kid.

I just waited for the flight attendant, calmly explained to her what had happened and that I would like to have my seats switched as far away from this kid and his mother as physically possible, and I would like the meal this asshole kid tastefully spread all over the carpet replaced, all while shaking with rage on the inside, and the mother screaming at me for the whole plane to hear about what an awful person I am, and how I dared to speak to her baby with anything other than smooshy wooshy saccharine gentleness.

The one thing that I responded to was when she said something I don't remember verbatum, about how awful my mother must be for me to turn out so inconsiderate and mean, and how I will never know the joys of motherhood. And even to that, all I said was something to the essence of ""at least my mother was competent, *gave a shit,* and and didn't delegate the job of raising me to strangers"".

The woman ended up being the one to switch seats and got a window seat out of it (she just yelled at the poor attendant, who looked visibly uncomfortable), I got my meal replaced, and I got seated next to a sweet Polish couple with whom I ended up sharing a bag of lemon drops. The mother spent the rest of the flight glaring daggers in my direction while I, obviously unable to sleep after this, was just listening to podcasts on my phone, not bothering anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I once had to be the one to teach a kid that not everyone is going to tolerate their bullshit (or just give no shits about it) the same way as his mom, and the mother yelled at me about how awful my mother must be, and how awful a mother I'll be. Now, I just can't help but laugh.

edit: I'd like to point out that I did nothing to provoke this kid's initial antipathy towards me. Literally just sat down, took out my book, and started reading. All I said was ""hi"" when they sat down next to me, and turned back to my book.",childfree
Why are you childfree?,"I personally think the planet is doomed and don’t want to bring a child into the world because I don’t want them to suffer through the global warming hellscape our generation has/is creating. Plus I don’t want to condemn them to the same suffering/trauma everyone’s parents seem to inflict on their children.  I’m still pretty young and EVERYONE keeps telling me I’ll change my mind, so I’m running out of new explanations to give them. It’s boring telling the same reason to everyone I meet. Just wanted a running list of other people’s reasons all in one place.",childfree
It's the most wonderful time of the year!,"I cannot WAIT for winter to come! My apartment complex/neighborhood used to be really chill and full of retirees. The past two years, the retirees have moved or died and the families are coming in droves. Our next door neighbors, back door neighbors, and people on the third floor above us all have young children. They all go out in the yard and SCREAM bloody murder for hours. When they first moved in, I actually went outside to make sure no one hurt themselves. It wasn't normal play yells, it was like someone was stabbed. I was legit about to call 911. But no, it's just these unsupervised shits screaming for no reason. 

I am counting the days until it is too cold for them to go outside and play. They can stay in their own homes and annoy the shit out of their parents for the next 4 months. And I can finally watch my TV shows in my living room without children's screams throughout the entire episode.",childfree
How do i stop feeling like i do want kids when i don't?,"My brain is confused. I know i don't want kids for so many reasons. It seems more reasonable for me to not have kids. But deep down i still feel like i do want kids, when i don't????

Everyone says your end goal is to have a family. I don't want one. I see how my parents are and how much they have to take care of us and all that, and i don't want anything to do with it. I feel like if i did have kids, its only because everyone says you can't grow old and childless without being miserable. That you failed if youre not married with kids. Everyone else is doing it, i feel like i have to too.",childfree
"I am mature enough to get married, but not to decide about MY life?","Okay, so this is a major rant than anything. I[20F] am in college, living with parents, and while I know many of you will say that I could go out and support myself- that's not really an option, social and personal reasons. So I can't go out before finishing my undergrad. 

I have 1.5 years more before I can go out and actually steer my life, but still I am sick of the constant projections from my parents. I am more than grateful for their money and support. I respect them spending their hard earned money on me, but I also make sure to work my ass of to justify their spending. I don't know what else I am supposed to do anymore, I listen to their views, I respect their opinions, I value their presence, but I am my own person. 

So all this was bearable until one fine morning i expressed my desire of remaining unmarried and childfree. At that point they point blank nulled my intelligence as well as told me that I have no right to actually decide about my own marriage (in the sense that everyone gets married one day) and that we should follow the society norms, and as a women I should appreciate the gift of motherhood?

Okay, so I should have kids and a husband because I am a woman. 

Cool.

I wouldn't go in the past, and recount how my parents did a number on my mental health. How there are more than one reason why I don't want kids. I just believe that having a child is a decision that a women has the right to make. No offense to males, but the sheer change and imbalance a child creates to our body and mind is not something that men understand all the time.

I am often called selfish and emotionless, but really I am the one who's truly thinking as a mother by choosing to not make a child's life miserable and not taking the responsibility I can't deliver.

How am I selfish here? Children are alive, human, not some toy or accessories that you should add to your life, niether they are the ultimate solution to your troubled marriage and for your enlightenment.

I can go on and on about this, but I just am sick of people belittling me when they themselves are damned hypocrites.",childfree
Pre-pre-OP appointment tomorrow,"Sorry if the flair isn’t right, I’m just pre-fix so I wasn’t sure what to flair it.

I (21f) am going to see my doctor tomorrow afternoon, for basically a verification before the pre-op appointment. I have to be scheduled before the end of the year because of deductibles and out-of-pocket costs with insurance.

The only thing I want to be wary of scheduling wise is Thanksgiving. I don’t want to be recovering while I’m around my whole family who have no clue I’m making this decision. But my doctor said she does surgeries on Thursday usually, and people are typically back up and going by Monday, so I should need just a weekend.

Scheduling is usually 2-4 weeks out for surgeries, so I would need to do it soon, or after Thanksgiving.

I’m nervous as shit for the surgery. I’m not excited to be knocked out and blown up with air. But this surgery will prevent any “oopsies” and will give me a firm “I’m sterile” response when people ask about children.

Keep me pumped guys. Surgery scares the shit out of me and I don’t want to chicken out for a non-reason reason I overthought myself.",childfree
That one time I got dragged in to babysit twins,"*Apologies ahead of time for long-winded post*

This happened about 2 years ago. At the time my mother was getting some cash from a friend (who is in her early 50s) to help care for at-the-time 2 year old twins. Cute kids tbh, full of energy and rambunctious of course but fairly sweet kids. 

The issue I have with her and her husband was that they already have a 16 year old (at the time) daughter. For some reason he wanted more kid(s), spoke to his wife about it, and she reluctantly agreed, but had a surrogate carry the embryos. Not sure if he chose twins or if it was an IVF fluke, idk, but the woman carries them for 9 months, births them, and gets paid (only benefit tbh, the woman’s got a serious set of ~~balls~~** ovaries on her, but R.I.P. your body). 

So back to the present in-story, the wife is seeiously short fused, gets pissed at the kids for being kids and yells at them to “cut it out” and shit, whacks them with a stuffed animal or pillow when they won’t be silent, and constantly bitches how her husband “el señor just HAD to have more kids”. The guy is whipped and when he’s home (rarely, since he works long hours), he just quietly takes all her roasting of him. This lady is such a germaphobe she refuses to take these kids out to a park, the store, etc. From the moment they are born, they are stuck inside the same 4 walls with toys they’ve had since they were born and kid’s tv. A depressing fucking existence and I was sick of it by the hour that I was stuck having to endure the babysitting task.  16 year old sister never pokes her head outside her room and games all day, never interacts with the babies, mom refuses to involve her at all in any chores or to connect the babies and her together. She’s basically a stranger to these kids. Sad as fuck, but I’m getting ahead of myself....

So this particular day, my mother is there helping the wife with the two babies, cooking, changing diapers whatever, when she feels a sudden sickness come upon her. She wants to puke and breaks into cold sweat and realizes she needs to go home but can’t leave the wife (a friend of hers) with the kids alone. So she calls me and begs me to come fill in, I reluctantly agree thinking it won’t be such a big deal, just some entertaining, maybe some feeding, handing things to mom, etc. 

Instantly I’m having to handle not just child tantrums but clearly unfit mother temper (they are triggering each other, kids not getting attention and her wanting to just run from the situation, and it’s just funny sad seeing this unfold). I’m trying to hang on to patience while I entertain them and they do seem to be pretty interested considering they don’t see the outside world at this point unless for doctor visits. I try to not lose my shit dealing with the puking and the drooling, thinking how the house is hot as fuck and she doesn’t turn on the AC for some reason, that there’s only 6 more hours to go, I’m seeing none of this cash but it’s for mom.... 

Then after mealtime she asks me to change both their diapers. Not just one child, both. I’m sorry, I draw the line. One of them even had nasty diarrhea and I’m trying so hard not to gag/white out. Even though I had younger siblings, the most involvement I had was gingerly picking up the diaper and running to the trash to dump it, but because I was the only one tasked with doing it every damn time, for each sibling. Sick of that shit, no pun intended. 

The woman is obviously tired but at this point I refuse to clean up diarrhea, much less from a child who isn’t even mine. It smelled so goddamn bad and his wailing didn’t make it any better. I just sat on the couch and shook my head “no!” repeatedly, I was not about to get up. This is not what I signed up for, mom. 

She goes off to change them both and I wait in the living room dying to be out of this hot ass house. I can tell she’s pretty pissed I’m not budging. Finally the time rolls around where I get to leave. I don’t go back ever thank god. But my mom was mad I refused to change shitty diapers, never mind that I didn’t get paid and I helped with everything else (feeding, putting them to sleep which was as impossible as teaching a fish to walk, etc). 

**Moral of the story: don’t be a selfish asshole and have kids or force kids on your partner that they don’t want, then get pissed when they act like attention-needing babies do, and be mad at a person who refuses to help you with something as delicate as diaper changing. Idk about y’all but that should be a task the mom does, especially not someone like me who got called in to assist with zero experience.**

*TIL: unfit mom bends to selfish husband with need for more children (probably mainly for the boy to carry on the family name), pays for surrogate to have twins, I get asked by my mom to fill in babysitting for the day because she doesn’t feel well despite total lack of interest and experience, get shit on (punny) after I draw the line at changing diarrhea-filled diapers.*",childfree
Just finished my second class of confirmation...,"Honestly I don’t agree with the Catholic Church when it comes to having children, birth control, and abortion, but today set me off. The teacher I have this year said that if you are married and don’t have kids, it’s just being selfish. He said the sole purpose of marriage is to have kids. I don’t think this is the right thing to say at all considering how negative of an impact you have on the planet if you decide to have one.

Breeder philosophy ruins everything,"So I coach track at a high school. 

It’s my first year coaching track and it’s my first year teaching at this particular school. 

Anyway, once a week, we have 15 minute “character development” sessions before practice… and I find myself completely at odds with the boy’s head coach’s philosophy. 

He’s constantly /shaming/ them into “being better athletes” during character development, saying variations of: 
“If you want to be a better athlete, you can’t be selfish. You have to stick the commitments you made to your team.”

He’s /obsessed/ with the idea of /commitment/ to the /team/ and /selfishness./ 

He’s also a father. 

And he has verbally admitted to me that track “is like fatherhood”/ that he wants to “mold” his “boys into men” by teaching them to stick to their “duties.” 

And that always irritates me. 

Because, I want to tell them
That sports and hobbies should be selfish activities; that if you truly /want/ to run track and aspire to be faster (for whatever reason), I can help you. But that if it’s your mom or dad or friend or coach who’s pushing you to run every lap you run, and you aren’t doing it for you- maybe youre daydreaming about playing guitar or writing poetry or studying comp sci- then maybe you shouldn’t run track, maybe you should go do that other thing. 

I just don’t see the value in telling kids that they need to commit to this idea of being a “track star,” because they’re selfish if they don’t really want to be a track star and realize they tried something out they aren’t really into?

It’s almost as if parents are so used to this image of “self-sacrifice” that they can’t even imagine a system in which someone does something for themselves.
Or worse, they frame everything in terms of some moral hierarchy where “self sacrifice” is the END GOAL .",childfree
What do you guys think of a “milk machine” shirt?,"Hello all, 

Today I was forced to go into a mothers and maternity shop with my mom. While there, I saw a shirt that said “milk machine.” This really rubbed me the wrong way.. like great. Women are just machines to feed babies and keep another person alive. Like the shirt is basically reducing some women to objects. Like women are dairy cows and they just make milk. I can’t describe it - but the thought of referring to women as “milk machines” repulses me. 

I hate the idea of how once a woman has a baby, everything becomes all about the baby. A woman has to give up her body for nine months, risk her life in labor, potentially suffer severe complications from a traumatic birth, and then breastfeed a screaming baby for like a year?!? So many women breastfeed today. It’s so common. My FB feed is like half women talking about breastfeeding. And one girl was trying to sell her breastmilk on FB. Like wtf?

Like you can’t even get your body back after carrying the baby, you have to breastfeed too? Ppl seriously judge women who don’t breastfeed. It’s BS. And referring to a woman as a “milk machine”? That makes me sick tbh.. the thought of a tiny human sucking from my body for many months literally makes me angry. But tbh I have some anger issues (and I’m pretty sure I’m on the spectrum).. so my thoughts about all things pregnancy and breastfeeding may be very angry/extreme. 

Are these thoughts too extreme/am I mentally overreacting?",childfree
[RANT] Third breakup this year,"Like the title says - just had my third breakup this year alone, directly due to the long-term family plans of involved parties.  And I wouldn't be posting here normally, but all of these relationships were amazing - like if we had agreed one way or the other on children, it would still be going strong. (Not with all three women simultaneously. Just that all of them had that potential.)  Literally the only thing that torpedoed each situation was a desire for children.

Why does my future happiness depend solely on people who don't even fucking exist, except in a potential context?  I mean, I get it - some people want to have kids.  But when I asked these women, trying to gain further clarification, the answer was ""I want to have kids."" Ok but *why* do you want them? ""I just want to be a mother, that's what it feels like my path is."" ^*mentally* ^*tearing* ^*hair* ^*out*

Maybe this is selfish of me. I can't expect everyone I like to be on the same page for most things; certainly not for all things; and very rarely for big-ticket issues like this.

Sometimes you do change your mind.,"This turned out to be longer than I thought. TLDR at bottom. 

My husband(20M) and I(20F) got together when we were both 17. When we first met, a year and a half before we started dating I said I wanted kids one day and he said he didn’t want them because he was “selfish” and didn’t want to share his wife. Well we became best friends and then obviously a year and a half later started dating. We knew pretty much right away we would get married because we were such close friends and just really got on well. A year into dating we broke up for about six hours because we had different ambitions and I thought I wanted kids like right away in my early 20s and he wanted to wait until he was at least 28 if we ever decided to have them, so we agreed we would discuss it again in a few years. Well I grew up a lot in this time and realized kids suck your whole life away pretty much and for the last year agreed that I didn’t want kids either. All the friends I had were mothers and I just did not envy that life at all. I realized I only wanted kids because I thought that’s what you were supposed to do, and do it young so that you can recover easier physically and the kids be old by the time you’re in your 40s. It was SUCH a relief for my marriage! Well in August I got pregnant because we were stupid and I found out at 4 weeks because I track my cycle so I knew the day after my period was missed. My immediate reaction was that I needed an abortion and I didn’t want this. I told my husband and said “don’t freak out. I’m pregnant. But it’s okay, we don’t have to keep it.” He was pretty freaked out. The next two weeks were hell. The hormones really really got to me, I decided that I wanted to keep the baby and that I was excited about being pregnant and I told my parents because I knew they would be excited, and my husband said basically that if I chose to have the baby that he would leave because he was serious about being childfree. I love my husband so much so I agonized over this decision, I was awash with idolized domesticity. I really thought I was going to leave and go on my own because I was hurt that he wouldn’t do anything for me, but loved him too much to really leave so I decided I would have the abortion. It was still really hard for a week and then I just stopped being upset about it, and in the middle of this, we were moving from Germany to America so it was stressful. God I hated being pregnant. It fucking sucked. So when we got to America, I took the abortion pills from Aid Access and ended up in the hospital because I had so much pain from it, but most of my symptoms pretty much went away half way through my body expelling the fetus. I have not felt one single shred of regret (it’s been two weeks). I really didn’t want children and I still don’t. Beware of those damn pregnancy hormones because they really almost had me and would have ruined my life. My husband and I are very happy with our choices, and he’s now in the process of finding a doctor to perform a vasectomy. I literally have nightmares about being pregnant again, I think I would die if I had to go through that again. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my story! 

TLDR; My husband knew he didn’t want kids but I thought he’d change his mind. It turned out that *I* changed my mind and we are happily childfree! I recently got pregnant and almost changed my mind again from hormones, but made the decision to abort and have absolutely zero regrets.",childfree
"Long time lurker here, but I wanted thank you to all you lovely people for opening my eyes to the ways of openly disliking crotch gremlins","I'm still very young (17) and still practically a child myself, but I can tell you for damn sure I never want kids for several reasons 

1. my family line carries a whole fuckin list of problems from mental to physical, nothing I'd ever want to pass onto someone else.
2. I have a lot of mental and physical problems, things I was born with and will most likely die with, that would make taking care of children very hard on me and very hard on whatever poor hellspawn got stuck with me as a mother
3. and the most important, and the reason for this whole post: **I don't fuckin like em**

Whenever people ask about my future, and I tell them I never plan on having kids, I get the usual ""oh you'll change your mind"" ""you're too young to know that"" ""once you turn 30 your hormones will decide for you"" (*whatever the ever-living fuck that means)* and my personal favorite ""you just haven't met the right man yet, once you settled down you'll want a family"" (*first of all, I'm a lesbian, second of all, a relationship has nothing to do with my personal choice, and third, fuck you)*

For my whole (admittedly short) life, I've had to be nice to children and act like they're sweet little angles, put up with shitty, neglectful parents who just fuckin let their kids run wild and cause chaos, it never really crossed my mind that there was another way to live my life or another way to act, it had been so drilled into my head that someday I'd just be stuck with kids, and that until then I'd have to act like I enjoyed being around other peoples hellspawns.

Then I found this sub and realized that, no, I'm not stupid or immature for not liking kids, and no, I don't have to pretend to like them. It's been so fuckin *nice* to see other people who feel like I do, just living their lives and enjoying themselves, to see people who don't like or pretend to like children, who in fact actively dislike them as I do, I remember seeing a comment on a post about a woman who had told off a kid for hitting her dog that said ""Yeah! Screw that kid, good for you!"" and I can not express to you the *delight* I felt at seeing someone openly say ""yeah! Kids suck!"", and more importantly, seeing someone say that and be supported instead of being treated like a freak, its so nice to know there are other people who just honestly don't like kids, I don't like being around kids, I don't like dealing with kids, I don't like kids touching me, and I *certainly* don't like being around their parents, and I'm just really glad that this sub opened my eyes to that, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, my future doesn't look quite as depressing now that kids are out of the picture.

no neither of us will.

"You're right, let me risk my job to make your life easier. (AIRPORT EDITION)","I work for a Major US airline as a supervisor at a decent sized airport.  I have so many stories of entitled parents demanding special attention because their crotch squatches are with them.

Oh, I could write a novel my dear friends.

Today, I'll just stick with one story. 

A co-worker of mine came to me and told me about the passengers she was dealing with that wouldn't take no for an answer. She said "" Can you help me? I have told them that policy is we cannot allow passengers who do not have tickets through security. They won't listen, and since they have twins they want an exception.""

FYI: 
For those not specially familiar with U.S. travel, airlines have the ability to issue 'gate access' passes to individuals if we deem fit (usually to assist disabled people to their gate)

I immediately went into ""HELLL NO"" mode. I kindly approached this little family and asked what I could help them with (I already fucking knew what was going to happen). The mombie told me that since she was traveling with twins she needed her mom to go with her to the gate. I asked if she was traveling alone with the twins (not that it would matter) and she said no my husband is going with me, and point at him.

I reaffirmed what my co-worker had told them. We will not be issuing your mom a gate access pass. It is against policy and security procedure.

She went full Karin. Took my name. Told me that's ridiculous to expect them to get to their gate with 2 toddlers. Complained under her breath and was an overall ridiculous human.

After a few minutes of her throwing a tantrum as her two lil bitty twins watched, she walked away with her nose in the air.

I looked at my co-worker and shrugged. She thanked me for backing her up. 

TLDR: Passenger insists her and her husband need help to the departure gate. Insist we need to allow her mother to go to the gate since they have twins. I say hahaha no and watch mombie storm away.",childfree

Mom cuts line at food pantry for hungry students,"So I'm one of those [40% of public university students in the U.S. that is food insecure](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/new-study-finds-that-36-percent-of-college-students-dont-have-enough-to-eat.html). My campus has a food pantry for students and we line up as much as an hour or more in advance because the line is so long it stretches waaaaay down the hall and everyone wants to get in before all the food is taken. A lot of students need food but cannot access it because they are in class (or work) when the line is forming or cannot wait the hour to get to the front of the line because they have to get to class (or work)--so this long line process keeps some students from eating.

Today this woman with a stroller gets there just as they're opening the pantry and cuts in front of everyone (she got permission from the student volunteer in charge). Then, because the pantry is a super tiny room, she takes up half the space with the stroller and semi-blocks others from getting to the shelves and fridge. And she was apologizing *to the baby* for taking too long. I didn't want to create added tension by protesting, but I shot her a very dirty look.

The entitlement is amazing! Lady, I had an abortion and got my tubes tied so I wouldn't be raising a kid in poverty! I didn't dump another unneeded person into the world and then claim ""poor mommy rights"" so that I can take food away from people who are being responsible by going to school *and not breeding*, and following the rules by waiting in line.

I finally stood up for myself and yelled at a child.,"Fun fact about me: I'm very shy and have anxiety. Whenever I was put in leadership positions over children there were always a few that bullied me and because I didn't want to get in trouble I always put up with it. I have never ever disciplined or yelled at a kid.

Except for yesterday.

Husband and I took our dog (my service dog, off duty) to a festival/fair yesterday. We allowed people to pet him, and he got treats and had a blast. We also went because we wanted to hang out with friends and browse wares. It was fun.

Except one table.

I was looking at a yard sale type booth where they had jewelry. This mom and kid come stand next to me and dog. Harmless enough.

Kid has a maraca and was shaking it. He was also picking up fragile jewelry and throwing it back onto the table. I had a bad feeling and inched away.

Not fast enough.

He saw dog.

He lunged with the maraca and started violently shaking it at dog, getting closer and closer to his nose.

Y'all.

I actually lost it. I literally scream-yelled ""NO. DO NOT DO THAT. THAT IS NOT OKAY."" and put myself between him and dog, getting right in the kid's face.

The ladies running the booth were staring at me. People on the street were staring at me. The mom glared at me.

But she grabbed her kid's hand and moved him away.

“What if your mom didn’t have you?”,"Honestly? Her life would have been a whole lot better.

I decided to embrace it, and told him that children were not going to be part of my future. He told me that he’ll choose me over potential children, but I don’t know if that’s fair to him or if the relationship will last when we’re older and he’s “ready”.

Christmas parties should be a childfree space!,"I work for a small family company that has grown rapidly. Millions in turnover over 200 members of staff.

Funnily enough I skipped the last one but have been hounded to plan this years by a group of ladies here by known as Lady 1, 2 and 3 and of course me.

L1: Nona you will plan the Xmas party this year won’t you? We should do one for all departments.

Me: I don’t really have time but I would if we were going to have a fab evening with no kids.

L2: why? We always have a children’s party

Me: well like 60% of staff here don’t have kids and 1) it feels weird to go to a party full of kids and 2) we don’t want to go to a party that’s full of kids

L3: oh Nona don’t be so horrible!

Me: what? Surely even parents want a break and remember it’s the people that work here Christmas party not the kids

L1: not many people can afford childcare so you’re just going to alienate 40% of staff then or you should just invite kids too

Me: there’s no way I’m planning a nice evening with drinks and dinner with some kids running around. There should be a day time thing for people with families if you feel so inclined but the evening should be adults only so we can celebrate with our work colleagues

If I’m old enough to decide what I’m going to do for years and years *and decide that I want kids already* then I’m old enough to decide that I don’t. If I’m mature enough to have a job, even a part time job, and drive on my own I can decide that I don’t want a child. I’m gradually becoming an adult. I should be able to make that choice without receiving comments calling me a kid myself and calling me silly. Telling me I’ll grow out of it and “we all think silly things as kids”. I want to make my choice without being told I’ll change my mind or that it’s rude to say that when I still rely on my parents still. I’m almost an adult in the eyes of the law.

No one is responsible for your choices but you.,"I saw a picture circulating on my news feed and re-posted by a few of my parent friends. It was a picture of a group of people around a dining table and a mother with her child off to a corner. The commentary that went along with it was to raise awareness for others to step in and care for a child that’s not theirs so that the parent can get a break and enjoy the festivities with the rest of the group. 

“I never wanted to forget how isolating it felt at dinners and parties to be walking a baby around while everyone sips on wine and tickles the baby’s feet as I pass them instead of offering to help me eat without a human on me”

It almost shamed people for not offering a helping hand or stepping in for respite care. They suggested that not doing so leaves the parent feeling left out or it can build resentment in them for not being included. 

In my opinion, those are the kinds of situations you sign up for when you decide to be a parent. Honestly, I think it’d be great if someone stepped in for them to partake in activity but if no one does—that’s not anybody elses problem or fault. It aggravates me to think that blame would be placed on others if they were not to lend a helping hand. You chose to have a kid and you chose the responsibilities that come with it. It is not anyone’s responsibility to care for a child that is not theirs whether you’re struggling, feeling left out, or other.

Dear Bingo-ers: People like us just might be saving the world for YOUR children.,"The older generations wantonly reproduced and now billions of people are sucking the world dry. Resources are fading and the climate is upending as we consume the world like locusts, and small-minded people are only focusing on judgment. We're selfish and flawed for choosing a child free life. How could we, and ESPECIALLY the women among us, choose to live a life where our singular focus is not having babies?

I have news for those with children who decide to be dicks to those who don't: because of us, YOUR children, and THEIR children, might just have a fighting chance at the future. People like us are natural population control. So keep that in mind the next time you judge a child-free person. Keep that in mind next time you want to tell us that we aren't ""thinking things through"", or that we'll change our mind because you think you know better than us, or whatever other bullshit you want to spout off about women having to be mothers. You shouldn't be judging us, you should be THANKING us. I won't go so far as to actually expect a thank you, because unlike your idea of me I'm not actually selfish and don't need applause for my choices. A respectful acceptance will do just fine.

My mom's supportive if not confused,"I told my mom that I am pretty sure I'm going to remain childfree like my aunt and uncle and she supported me.

Kids are expensive and I like having new, nice things. I like that I can afford to spoil my dogs endlessly and if something happens, I can afford to pay for it. I want acreage and horses. I want 4 dogs (I have 2!). I want to travel. I want to live my life for me. 

I grew up very poor. I was a kid in 2007 and my parents were supporting 6 kids. Like many others, we lost our house to a bank who was later sued for fraud (the people won!) My one aunt has 4 kids and 2/4 are an absolute mess. The other 2 are iffy. They had a shit childhood. My other aunt has 3 (16 and under). The struggling for money, patience, time? Not for me. IF I ever decided to, it would definitely be adoption. But it's highly likely I won't ever. 

My mom told me that I have time to change my mind bc I'm only 23 (which is true) but if that's what I want, she supports me 100%. I really appreciate her support and was scared to tell her. But she understands and even appreciated that I had thought it out since I did want kids for so long.

I need some advice,"This may be a bit of a doozy... I'm trying to figure out who to word a response to my best friend, a nun that is 29. Yes, a full fledged sister of the cloth.

Rosette (fake name) and I have been best friends since we were about twelve years old, and have known each other since we were about seven or eight. Being 29 now, that's practically our entire lives. We've always thought of each other as soul sisters, and even more since she became a nun five years ago.

I've known that I would be CF basically my entire life. Always wanted cats not kids, and as a teenager I knew I wanted my tubes tied. Well, good news teenager me, your tubes are being removed in two weeks! Yay! But my best friend, Rosette, came from a religious family, but she was always pretty neutral or open to a lot of non-catholic things. I did know that part of her life dream was to find a partner, get married, and have children. The Catholic American dream... but in her early 20's she started changing her mind about things, started visiting monasteries, and in the end chose to be a nun, because to her, it was the path that God had put out for her. 

I was visiting Rosette for a weekend in August, before I had my consultation appointment. I was so excited about the possibility of my procedure, and what it means to me overall, which is my personal freedom. I knew that Rosette wouldn't love the idea, but I was hoping she'd at least accept the idea. Turns out it was a crushing blow for her. One of those, she was better off not ever knowing things. We did talk in my visit about what it would mean for me, and I mentioned that if I ever did change my mind in the future (won't happen), that I would adopt a child that needs a home. Kinda hoped ""at least there's that"". In the end, I just asked her to pray for what is the best possible outcome.

Anyway, yesterday morning I got an email from her titled ""Some thoughts"". I read it at work, and honestly... I was disappointed. Here are some snippets.

* ""Having the surgery will really reduces your integrity as a human person, reducing yourself to an object. It will reduce your feminine ability to receive. It also reduces the integrity of \*Derp\* to give as a husband.""
* ""Growing in charity and coming together in union brings the fruit of a child, a true blessing. ""
* "" Let \*Derp\* love you, and rely on one another to make it through the hard financial times. Let your love be seen in abundance and let children fill your house with warmth and laughter. ""
* "" You may want to fight for your right, but I'm fighting for your right to be truly deeply loved, whole and entire. Right now you don't want any kids, fine. But you don't know what the future holds.""

\*Derp\* = my derp of a husband, who is 1,000% on board with the CF life and is almost just as excited for my  bi-salp as I am.

So yeah. I just got bingoed by my childhood best friend of a nun. Maybe growing up I wasn't fully clear on my cats not kids life? Maybe she was hoping it was my teenage angst (there was lots of that). Anyway, I love Rosette with my entire soul, I'm just... disappointed at how extreme her views on this are now that she's a nun. I ran this by a mutual close friend of ours who is baffled at Rosette's response. 

I just want some advice on HOW I should word my response. Like, how do I tell her that we are BOTH doing the same thing, just different methods? She chose one of the most absolute childfree lifestyles. I honestly see this situation as two sides of the same coin kind of thing. I also see her as projecting her old life dream onto me, one that I need to burst right now. 

I'm childfree because I don't like dealing with children, I'm awkward, uncomfortable, and I feel zero maternal instinct. My brother pointed out when I wasn't even ten that I didn't care about anything but cats and dogs, and told my parents to expect that. I also grew up middle-class-poor. Aka, I had things, but no experiences. I want to travel across the US and the entire world. I want to see as much as possible. 

But honestly... I think what's holding back my ability to form my response is that I know I'm going to make her cry again, no matter what... and I just want to soften the blow as much as possible.

tl;dr: my best friend is a nun that thinks I'm gonna ruin my life with my bi-salp and thinks the end all be all of marriage is kids. I now need to respond to her in the kindest ""screw your religion, its my life"" way possible. Any advice helps.",childfree
I had to cancel my tubal ligation which was supposed to be day,"Previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/de6dhu/family\_keeps\_hounding\_me\_ever\_since\_i\_told\_them/](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/de6dhu/family_keeps_hounding_me_ever_since_i_told_them/)

My surgery was supposed to be today. However, my dad's car had broken down yesterday. He dropped it off for me at work yesterday and the engine wouldn't start up. I frantically called my dad and he came by to take a look at it, he isn't sure what exactly is wrong with it. This couldn't have happened at a more inconvenient time as we had to leave early next morning. The hospital is 3 hours away from where I live.

I suggested that we rent a car, and my dad said he no longer has a credit card (long story, he's having lots of issues). He said he doesn't know anyone he could borrow a car from, or anybody who could rent a car for us. Nor do I have anyone who could give me a ride. I tried to see how much an Uber would cost me and it was like $400 (and then another $400 back, so $800 in total). My dad said he'd try to figure something out but he wasn't taking it that seriously, didn't know what the rush was, and kept lecturing me about how he wants grandchildren, how this is against his religion, blah blah blah. But he told me to call him in the morning and we'd figure something out.

Come next morning, he's not answering his phone so I hop on my bike and ride all the way to his house and bang on the door. It took forever for him to wake up and open the door. I was so desperate to find a way there, in my mind cancelling wasn't an option. Today is the day of my surgery and I was so lucky that I was able to be squeezed in so soon after my consultation, and I worried that they won't have another opening for a long time. But my dad said he can't do anything about it and he doesn't want to be involved with this anymore. Also, his bitch girlfriend kept lecturing me about religion, God, and accused me of lying about the reason why I want this so bad and urgently. I finally snapped back at her and told her she needs to mind her own fucking business. She started reading symptoms of ''post tubal ligation syndrome''. This is coming from a woman who literally calls her kids a piece of shit everyday and screams at them.

I called the receptionist at the hospital and explained the situation. Car broke down, I live 3 hours away, a cab/uber is too expensive for me. She told me she could cancel it but my name would be dropped down to the bottom of the list. I had no other choice, but she said there definitely won't be another opening for me this year and I might not even get in until next spring.

So, I'm really upset about this. Like I've been bawling my eyes out all morning which might sound dramatic but I've waited for this day for such a long time, and now it's being pushed back. I wish I had stuck to my original plan of driving myself there and staying at my friend's house for the day. But at my pre-op appointment I was told that I need to be accompanied by an adult, and I cannot drive at all. I was worried that I might not be in any condition to drive so that's why I decided to tell my dad about the situation and ask him to drive me there and back.

"Being CF, and not wanting kids at your social event does kind make you the asshole. But I’m ok with that.","Here on our sub people keep asking how to uninvited people with kids to things. They say they don’t want to be a dick or bitch or asshole how do you do this with tact.

The short answer is you can’t. If you try to be polite and hint the friend will just bring the kid anyhow.

Uninviting people is just rude. It is. You can’t come because you have a child- will hurt feelings and people will take that personally. 

You can say they can come but the kid can’t will raise their hackles and they’ll pitch a fit and call you names.

I say own it. Yeah, I am a bitch because I don’t want kids at my thing. No I don’t want to hang out with your child. Yes I’m saying your kid is a hellion and that’s a reflection on you.

I say start standing our ground and if they call us names we say ‘YES WE ARE! And our parties will be so much better without kids there.’",childfree

Just found this sub,"This has got to be the most refreshing group of people I’ve found in a while! It’s nice to know I’m not the only one on this planet that doesn’t want kids. 

I’m only young (20 last week) and I’ve always said I’ve never wanted kids and yet every single adult I tell says that “I’ll change my mind” and that “you’ll find the right guy” I’m a lesbian sooo 🤷🏼‍♀️

Being active in feminist subs is hard too bc they’re so pro children despite the fact child birth is one of the biggest, if not one of the biggest, killers of women, and all time time I get called a misogynist for saying women are better off without them.

Made my mom-friend cry,"So I want to start out saying this was not intentional, I typically try to not make people cry. 

Anyway my reasons for being CF are numerous but what really cemented it for me was the death of my father. My family has a long list of health issues both mental and physical ranging from cystic fibrosis to bipolar disorder. About two years ago my father, my favorite person in the world, was suddenly diagnosed with a super aggressive form of cancer, from diagnosis to death took three weeks. By the time we found it it had spread to his brain, spine, stomach, and lungs. The stupid incompetent hospital he was at not only were unable to diagnose which kind of cancer it was but lost the samples they were sending to other labs for testing. He was fifty years old, his dad was fifty when he died of a heart attack, his brother died at fifty from skin cancer. 

Now that I don't know what kind of cancer to look for and it appears my family has offended someone enough to obtain a curse, I don't really think I want to add kids to the equation. Not to mention I'm scared to put kids of my through the hell I've had to live through as a result of his death. Relaying this all to my best friend of over ten years who is on her second child this resulted in a lot of tears. Not because of how horrible this all is, or my fears of getting the same cancer someday, but because of babies. I love her to death but the moment the conversation changed to ""Oh but that's not a reason to miss out"" I was done with the conversation.",childfree
My mother told me she wished she'd aborted me.,"I've known since I was very young my mother had conflicted feelings over me. My mother had my older sister at 21, she was a happy accident. She had me at 28, I was planned.

She was severely depressed, but tried her hardest. Yet there's something deeply broken in her, maybe from abuse or neglect, I'm not sure. But she's got a twisted cruel side to her. 

When I was 10 my sister moved out. I started acting out. Self harming, overdosing, impulsive etc, and my mother couldn't handle it. She screamed at me, threatened me, insulted me. 

She threw me out at 15. Told me I was a waste, that she wished she'd given me away or aborted me.

To this day she's very fucked up. Some days she loves me and is nice to me. Others she swears at me and says I'm evil.

She genuinely believes on some level I'm a monster. My father was murdered when I was a child, and she believes I'm milking his death for sympathy. She believes I want her to commit suicide so that I'll get attention for being a orphan. She told me a few weeks ago that she'll make sure to publicly blame me for her own suicide.

I developed borderline personality disorder and was diagnosed at 17. I spent years on and off drinking heavily, self harming, abusing drugs etc. In my late teens I went from being selfless and kind, to angry and paranoid. I noticed I was like my mother.

My mother should of aborted me. She should of given me up if not. People like her, and I for that matter, shouldn't have kids.",childfree
"First ""breakup"" due to being child free ... This hurts.","I've been talking to an old friend (10+ years) who lives far away now, for about 3 months. We both found ourselves single after a messy breakup and found that we had grown up to have very similar ideas about love, life and dreams and goals. She left her boyfriend of 8+ years because he wanted children, so I thought we were on the same page in that regard. She qualified that she didn't want children *with him*, but is leaning towards never having children, so our flirtation continued. We made vacation plans, we were thinking about how we could rearrange our lives to include each other if it got more serious. We were falling for each other, and it was mutual. I was elated. It felt incredibly rare, and special. I almost never connect with someone like this. We're late 20s early 30s btw.

Now, a couple of weeks without a heart to heart or an emotional check-in so to speak, I felt like something was wrong, and now I know. She thinks we should be just friends, because I am so certain I never want to have children, and she isn't. She doesn't want to feel resentful towards me if in 5-10 years she does want children and she's stuck with me.

Everything she says makes sense, but this is new to me. I've always been vocal about being childfree, but my recent vasectomy doesn't exactly leave any room for doubt. I don't want children with anyone, and I would never compromise.

But this just hurts. And I have no one to tell.",childfree
Apple orchard from hell,"My girlfriend and I went to an apple orchard yesterday. It has the typical orchard stuff - apple picking, hayrides, pumpkin patch, playground for kids, corn maze, etc. We had gone to the same one about a year ago, and while there were of course kids there last year, I don't recall seeing anything that made me say, ""This place is filled with demon spawn.""

We get there and there are so many families with kids running around screaming, hitting each other, falling down and crying, etc. My girlfriend looked at me and I could tell she was contemplating making the suggestion to leave. We had driven about 30 min to get there though, so amidst the chaos we just stuck it out. The people in front of us in line to get in to the orchard had 3 kids, one who was clearly much older than the younger two. The parents gave literally zero fucks that the two youngest were running around screaming and hitting each other; the whole time they're completely engrossed in their phones, not paying attention. The older boy was the one who was actually taking care of his siblings, watching them to make sure they didn't run off or get run over by a car. I felt bad for him because he couldn't have been more than 13 years old and looked stressed out and exhausted. Anyway, we finally get into the orchard and there are so many kids darting in front of us, I was actually afraid one was going to run into me when I was just standing there and fall down and get hurt. Speaking of falling down- there was a kid who was running around, falls in some mud, and immediately starts crying. Her dad comes over and helps her up, and she's just screaming and crying like someone stabbed her. So he starts saying ""shhhh!"" over and over again, but she doesn't stop crying. Meanwhile, my girlfriend is venting to me about how awful children are and this delights me because I of course don't want any. We walk through the orchard to where the little shops for food and homemade goods are...you know, apple stuff. And I see where they're selling apple cider brats in what's called a ""brat hut."" I said that's where the kids should go. 

We're waiting in line for apple cider for what feels like FOREVER and come to find out there are so many parents ahead of us who insist that their kids pay individually for whatever they're getting. I understand the logic of this - teach kids how to pay for their own things and, if they're using their allowance, they can understand the value of a dollar. BUT do that at a time and place where it's not SO FREAKING BUSY and not when there's a line of people waiting behind you! Kids typically just aren't as fast as adults at counting money or doing anything really, so they're fumbling around for loose change and whatnot. The entitlement of some parents is just so freaking ridiculous it astounds me. This is one orchard that I will be avoiding in the future...too many kids running amok acting like idiots and too many parents not giving a shit.",childfree

How do we feel about newborn babies on flights?,"I've had the unfortunate luck of having the last 9/10 flights I've been on ruined by screaming babies for a few hours and, as such, think babies of a certain age should be banned from flights, or should only be allowed to travel on certain flights.  

A member of one of my FB groups posted about taking her new baby (when it's born next month) to Greece for the New Year and I mentioned not inflicting the baby on everyone else (also gave friendly advice about where they could go on the assumption my comments would be ignored). This started a massive row with all the mombies about ""My child never..."" etc.  

I was just wondering where all of you stood on the issue?  

UPDATE: My comment has since been removed from the FB post because the GTS page are a bunch of pansies.  

UPDATE 2: Every single comment that has a negative opinion (don't like kids on flights) has been down voted and every positive opinion (yes to kids on flights) has been upvoted.

What age is the right age to get an endometrial ablation? + Period rant,"I am 17 years old, and ever since I was young, I’ve hard these excruciatingly painful periods. It usually only happens during the first day, but going to school with them has been absolutely horrible.  My nmom refuses to take me to a doctor or let me have painkillers (and there’s no one else in my life who can get me there), so I have to steal from her when she’s not around or hoard them whenever I find any laying around the house. I only ever use them on the first day, however, and even today as I’m off to school I decided to try a heating pack so I can stop relying on medication. I tried convincing her to let me go on the pill, and even tried finding ways to get it myself (although I’d have to pay AND it’s coming to her address). Nothing has come out of it.

My periods are usually irregular, lasting 5 days max, yet happening almost every other month. The pain makes me so freaking suicidal to the point where I sat in my kitchen for 10 minutes this morning contemplating whether I should go to school or go upstairs and hang myself. Even here on the bus as I type this Ijust want to stab myself with scissors or do something, ANYTHING to end the pain. I’m sweating, I feel like I’m going to collapse, and I have to pee every five seconds (which doesn’t work at school because class). It doesn’t help that I already have severe depression. I’ve read the symptoms of endometriosis and I’m pretty sure I don’t have that, but I can’t be too sure. I never want kids. EVER. And having to deal with this is so unbearable. I’m exhausted just typing this.

I’ve heard that if you get an ablation at a young age, the lining will grow back and raise hell. I wanted to get one in college, but I’ve heard that it’s best to wait until your 30s for it to be permanent. 

What age do you recommend getting an ablation at? For women who have had an ablation, what age did you get yours, and was it permanent?",childfree
I am not a woman until I have a child,"I \[25F\] was visiting my parents for the last 4 days because of holidays and I just wanted to spend some time with them since I kinda missed my dad (definitely not my mom).

Well, one evening I was talking with them about stuff and it just turned to kids and I just told them that I am very set on not having kids for various reasons that many of us know about. Well, my dad was kinda disappointed but he said it was up to me, he can't force me.

My mom tough... Starting yelling crazy things about me. Lemme summarize the stuff she told me:

\- The famous ""I am very selfish"" for not wanting to give life to someone else

\- She didn't raise me to be like this. I must have been influenced by somebody (not really, no).

\- I am still a child and can't call myself a woman until I have a child. One becomes an adult and gets such happiness and fulfillment when they have a child.

\- How dare I not let her experience the happiness of being a grandmother. She had me so that I can give her happiness and she expects me to make her happy by giving birth to a child.

\- My desire of not wanting a child is illogical and by nature every woman wants and NEEDS to have a child. My desire of not wanting to have children can't be taken seriously since I don't know what I am talking about...

&amp;#x200B;

Well, there were some other points but not as important I guess. And I tell you, she wasn't saying this in a calm voice or even a slightly raised voice. She was yelling as hard as she could while saying all this (I bet people could hear her a mile away...).

Then, throughout the whole visit she would be saying sneaky remarks about this topic to try to make me doubt myself and my desires and just put me down in general.

Now that I am finally home, I am extremely exhausted. I am just sad throughout the day because it pains me how she thinks of me like I am nothing without a child. Kinda makes me feel a little worthless.

I really don't want to cut ties with my mom (and it would mean my dad too I guess) since they are the only family I have that made many sacrifices for me and the only reason I have a life I have right now.

Any advice on what I could do? Is there a way I could deescalate the conversation about children  whenever we talk about it?",childfree

The Places We Will Go...,"I sometime wonder if the answer to the BINGO issue isn't just to build a manmade island or to buy one that is unoccupied and for sale.   
In either case we could turn it into a childfree zone where people who don't want kids could work and play without the hassle and noise that children create.  
No School Taxes or Buses, we could literally start competitive industries with far less taxes overhead. Just a low tax society for those who want to chase their fortune and fun.

Im Really Fucking Mad Right Now.,"I opened up to what you guys would call a Mombie. I don't like using phrases like that cause I try to be open to all points of view about my toxic family situation and she seemed like a good person. But to be honest she already made me start building the walls up. I was talking about how behind I felt compared to my peers and how shes grown as a person so she knows what Im going through...yet she thinks its a good thing that my parents said that if I got into an abusive relationship I would be the one in trouble and thinks it's just immaturity that that statement caused a rift and that I haven't told them what happened to me with my first sexual experience because I'm afraid of the shit I'll catch. 

She also sees no problem with Mom wanting to force me to be a mother if god forbid I were to accidentally get pregnant.  She says she can see where it would cause a rift? But sees no problem with it and says I'm misinterpreting what shes saying and that her wording is just harsh but what she actually means is if I have one it's my problem and responsibility.

I know I probably shouldn't be bitching publicly about a person. Especially since she stayed up just to try and talk to me because I'm in crisis right now to be honest about a lot of shit in my life. Still am. But her claiming she's recovered from her abuse when she still clearly has a very submissive attitude and is OK with being batted around because ""Her family wants to protect her"" and trying to tell me she gets it because shes been through it is making me overwhelmed and now so pissed off,I have to remind myself not to clench my teeth because of how hard I'm doing it. I'm afraid they'll crack. 

So now I'm completely overwhelmed with everything and pissed as hell. None of my better friends are on right now so I have no choice but to sit in this. She said shes gonna talk more tomorrow. I have a feeling I'm about to have a fight and have to actually stand up for my beliefs instead of deflecting convo like I normally would....sigh....

My tuition money is going to breastfeeding mothers instead of crucial mental health services,"I'm currently attending a public uni and although the tuition isn't terribly expensive, it is still a pretty penny. However, the services provided are falling extremely short of the money we pay to go here and it's pissing me off to no end. 

There have been numerous budget cuts to almost every sector of the campus - they even cut out an entire Minor program because there isn't enough money to hire more faculty.  But what pisses me off the most is that there's almost no support for students having mental health issues.

I believe I have severe depression and anxiety (never diagnosed because I've never been to a therapist before), and I had a traumatic event over the summer that I'm still failing to cope with. I went through the hoops of setting up a introductory meeting with the counseling faculty, and then they had the nerve to tell me they would contact me in 3-4 weeks for my initial therapy appointment. Keep in mind, they have a policy where a student can only have one semester worth of counseling, after that, you're on your own.

They called me to set up an appointment a few days ago, but I was studying in the library so I had to call them back - came to find out the number doesn't work, and they haven't contacted me since so I'm SOH. Even if I did get in contact with them, I'd only have about 2 months worth of services to help me get through a lifetime of depression/anxiety. 

But of course, as I'm walking through one of the main buildings I see a giant banner proudly displaying all the nursing pods they're constructing. They have some goddamn nerve to cater to the smallest minority of the campus population while there are so many people who can't get access to crucial services. 

There have been MULTIPLE student deaths recently (some from personal illnesses, others from suicide/homicide, scarily enough), and we don't even have enough counselors to help these people cope with trauma. It's absolutely un-fucking-believable that our tuition is going to something so unimportant when there are students *dying.*

I know it's for the student and staff, but seriously, they need to prioritize where the funding is going because there is 100% a severe mental health crisis on this campus. Almost every student I've talked to is having issues of some kind, my good friend even dropped out because of how inadequate the counseling is, and the uni has the nerve to divert the funding towards stuff like this. Unbelievable.",childfree
The ACLU declined to help in my lawsuit because childfree isn't protected.,"I had spoken of this before but I had a perfect 4.0 GPA and applied to an advanced counseling program. I did everything correct, even going above what I was supposed to do (like I got five references instead of three) and I was rejected. Made no sense until I started looking around (thanks to someone who assisted) and discovered a note stating because I was openly childfree I was a ""possible sociopath"". Not just that but the program can apparently only allow in so many students and they let in moms first (in fact, it's on a paper given to me that states this, first priority are single moms). I can't say more for obvious reasons.

I contacted the ACLU with this information and said it was pure discrimination. I received an email back stating that while it technically might be  wrong, they can't take the case. Yeah, they have defended murderers, pedohiles, but will not help the childfree. Obviously I am dropping this but this tells how much we are discriminated against. The program though got theirs, I was working on a scholarship for students in the program and I then pulled it.

Feeling Guilty,"Context: I'm in my first semester of university right now and I call my parents every night to tell them about my day because my dad is (in my opinion, justifiably) nervous about sending his only daughter to a strange city. 

TL;DR: My mom's life is completely defined by her being a mom, and now that I'm in college she has zero hobbies or social life. I feel guilty for doing that to her, and it's one of the main reasons I don't want to have kids. 

I called my mom today to give her her daily update: I went to a potluck with my engineering club at the local park and how I met up with a friend for a coffee/study date because we both have a chemistry quiz coming up. She told me about how she went shopping today, which is what she usually does every weekend, and I jokingly asked her if she had much going on outside of shopping, hoping to hear about some drama at her office or something. She was quiet for a second before she told me that no, she really didn't, and it's been super boring since I've been away these past few weeks. I asked her if she was taking any classes or working on her hobbies and she, in all seriousness, said that being a mom was her main hobby until I left. 

This is probably misplaced emotion, but I feel unreasonably guilty and sad. It's like I robbed my mom of having a full life just by being born. She tells me about her day and it just seems so bleak; all she does is work, sleep, and occasionally run errands and buy groceries. I can't imagine that being my life after having a kid, the thought is just horrifying. This is why I don't want to have kids. I also feel guilty for just saying that, because it's like I'm rejecting my mom because of her life choices or something. I know that logically that's not what happening, and I'm just choosing a different path than hers, but my reasons for doing so seem so shallow.",childfree
